## Introduction

> Focus: **Stop describing cost control and start configuring it.** You learned *why* telemetry costs and *that* sampling exists at junior level; here you build the collector pipeline that enforces it — with real `tail_sampling`, `attributes`, and `filter` processors — and you do the cardinality arithmetic that tells you exactly which knob to turn.

At junior level the three cost drivers — metrics → cardinality, logs → volume, traces → volume × spans — were a table to memorise. At this level they are *bills you diagnose with a calculator*. You will multiply label value counts and watch a 6,000-series metric become 3 billion. You will write tail-sampling policies that keep every error and slow trace while sampling normal traffic to 1%. And you will learn the one operational fact that shapes every large tracing deployment: **tail sampling can only work if all spans of a trace reach the same collector instance** — which dictates your collector topology before you write a single policy.

The center of gravity is the **OpenTelemetry Collector**. It is the seam between *what your application emits* (let it emit freely) and *what your backend bills you for* (controlled here, by config push, not by a redeploy). A middle engineer owns this seam: the processors in its pipelines, the order they run in, and the memory guards that stop the collector from OOM-ing under exactly the load it exists to handle. The `observability-stack` and `monitoring-alerting` skills frame where this fits in the larger telemetry architecture; this page is the cost-and-fidelity layer of it.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at middle level:** A junior knows "use tail sampling for errors." A middle engineer can write the policy, place the collector so the policy can actually see whole traces, cap its memory so it survives the spike, and explain to finance why the bill dropped 80% with zero loss of error visibility. The gap between those two is exactly this page.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** All of [`junior.md`](junior.md) — the three cost drivers, head vs tail in plain terms, the fidelity floor (never sample errors/audit/SLO/billing).
- **Required:** You can read and edit a YAML config and understand a `receivers → processors → exporters` pipeline shape.
- **Required:** [Metrics — Middle](../04-metrics/middle.md) — cardinality as a *product* of label value counts. This page assumes that arithmetic cold.
- **Required:** You know what a `trace_id` is and that one trace's spans are emitted by *multiple services*. ([Tracing](../05-tracing/).)
- **Helpful:** You've run the OTel Collector locally (`otelcol`/`otelcol-contrib`) at least once.
- **Helpful:** Basic Prometheus query syntax (`rate()`, recording rules) for the downsampling section.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **OTel Collector** | A standalone process that receives, processes, and exports telemetry. The control point for cost. Two distributions: `core` and `contrib` (the latter has `tail_sampling`). |
| **Processor** | A stage in a Collector pipeline that transforms, filters, samples, or batches data between receive and export. |
| **`probabilistic_sampler`** | A processor that keeps a fixed percentage of traces, decided by hashing the `trace_id`. Head-style, stateless, deterministic. |
| **`tail_sampling`** | A processor that buffers whole traces and applies policies after they complete. The only way to keep "all errors + a sample of the rest." |
| **`memory_limiter`** | A processor that sheds load (refuses data) when the Collector nears a RAM ceiling — the guard that keeps tail sampling from OOM-ing. |
| **Agent collector** | A Collector running close to the app (sidecar/daemonset), one per host/pod. Cheap fan-in, no whole-trace view. |
| **Gateway collector** | A central Collector tier that receives from agents. Where tail sampling lives, because traces can be routed here whole. |
| **Consistent / deterministic sampling** | Same `trace_id` → same keep/drop decision everywhere, so a trace is never half-kept across services. (Preview here; full treatment in [`senior.md`](senior.md).) |
| **Adjusted count** | A kept sample's weight, `1/sample_rate`, used to reconstruct true totals from sampled data. |
| **Exemplar** | A trace-ID pointer attached to a metric sample — a cheap bridge from an aggregate to one real example trace. |
| **Wide event** | A single, very high-dimensionality structured record per unit of work (Honeycomb-style). Trades metric cardinality limits for query-time aggregation. |
| **Downsampling / rollup** | Reducing the resolution of older metrics (e.g. 15s → 5m points) to cut long-term storage. |
| **Recording rule** | A Prometheus rule that precomputes a query into a new, cheaper series — also used to produce rolled-up metrics. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Collector is where cost decisions live — by config, not by deploy

The application should emit telemetry generously and *know nothing* about sampling. Every cost decision — which traces to keep, which labels to strip, which spans to drop — belongs in the Collector's pipeline, changeable with a config reload. This decoupling is what lets you respond to a runaway bill in minutes instead of a release cycle.

### 2. Processor order is semantics, not style

A Collector pipeline is an ordered list. `memory_limiter` must come *first* (it protects everything after it). `tail_sampling` must come *before* `batch` (you sample, then batch the survivors). An `attributes` processor that drops a label must run *before* the data is counted into a metric you derive alerts from. Reordering processors changes behaviour, sometimes silently.

### 3. Cardinality is a product; you must do the multiplication

Every metric's series count is the product of its labels' distinct values, times the metric's internal series (a histogram is ~14 series before labels). One label with a million values doesn't add a million — it *multiplies*. The only defence is to compute the product *before* shipping the label, and to allow-list anything user-supplied.

### 4. Tail sampling needs the whole trace in one place

A tail decision ("this trace errored, keep it") requires *seeing every span of the trace*. If spans of one `trace_id` land on different Collector instances, no instance has the whole trace and the decision is wrong. This single constraint forces the **agent → gateway** topology in any non-trivial deployment.

### 5. Cost control is mostly *moving* and *aggregating*, not deleting

The cheapest data is the summary you kept instead of the raw stream you dropped. The cheapest label is the one you moved from a metric (expensive cardinality) to a trace attribute (cheap). Aggregate at the source, move identity to where it's cheap, and keep exemplars as the bridge back — you lose far less than you save.

---

## Cost Drivers per Signal

The junior table named the drivers. Here is the arithmetic behind each one.

### Metrics — cardinality math

A histogram is not one series. It is one series per bucket, plus `_sum` and `_count`:

```text
http_request_duration_seconds (Prometheus default ~10 buckets + _sum + _count) ≈ 14 series
   labels: method(4) × status(6) × route(20)
   = 14 × 4 × 6 × 20 = 6,720 series          ← healthy
```

Every label *multiplies*. The killer is an identity label:

```text
   + user_id (500,000 values)
   = 6,720 × 500,000 = 3,360,000,000 series  ← 3.36 BILLION; TSDB dead
```

The label call cost nothing at write time. The cardinality it created is the entire bill — and it lands on *every* tenant sharing that TSDB.

### Logs — volume math

Logs cost bytes × retention, with an index multiplier:

```text
   2,000 log lines/sec × 1.2 KB/line = 2.4 MB/sec
   = ~207 GB/day raw
   × 30 days retention = ~6.2 TB stored at any time
   × (often 2–5× for the search index) = the real bill
```

Turning DEBUG on doubles line count; adding three fat fields per line doubles bytes. Both compound against retention.

### Traces — volume × spans math

```text
   50,000 req/sec × 30 spans/trace = 1,500,000 spans/sec
   × ~1 KB/span = 1.5 GB/sec ingested
   = ~129 TB/day at 100% sampling   ← unaffordable; this is why traces are sampled
```

Keep 1% and that's ~1.3 TB/day — still large, which is why tail sampling (keep the *useful* 1.8%, not a blind 1%) matters.

### Wide events / high dimensionality

A "wide event" replaces dozens of low-cardinality metrics with one very high-dimensionality record per request (hundreds of fields, including high-cardinality ones like `user_id`, `build_sha`, `feature_flag`). It dodges the metrics cardinality cliff by *not pre-aggregating* — you aggregate at query time instead. The cost moves from "series stored forever" to "events ingested and queried." This is the Honeycomb model; metrics carry the cheap aggregate, wide events carry the high-dimensionality detail.

---

## Cardinality Control

You control cardinality in three escalating ways, cheapest first.

**1. Don't emit the label.** The only label with zero cost is the one you never added. Treat every new label as a cardinality decision, made on purpose, with the product computed.

**2. Allow-list the values.** When a label comes from user input or an external system, map it through a fixed allow-list; anything unknown collapses to `"other"`. This caps an unbounded source at the instrumentation site (covered in [Metrics — Middle](../04-metrics/middle.md)).

**3. Drop or rewrite at the Collector.** When the bomb already shipped, strip it in the `attributes` processor before it reaches the backend. This is the emergency lever — config push, no deploy.

The deeper move is **move identity off the metric entirely.** A metric should carry the *category* (`tier="enterprise"`); the *identity* (`customer_id="cus_8X2k"`) belongs on a trace attribute, a log field, or an exemplar — all places where high cardinality is cheap because they aren't pre-aggregated into permanent series.

### Worked cardinality-explosion example — with numbers and the fix

A team adds a checkout latency histogram. To debug one merchant's slow checkouts, someone adds `merchant_id` "temporarily."

```text
metric: checkout_duration_seconds   (~14 series: 12 buckets + _sum + _count)
labels BEFORE:  status_class(4) × region(3)
   = 14 × 4 × 3 = 168 series                      ← fine

labels AFTER adding merchant_id (40,000 merchants):
   = 14 × 4 × 3 × 40,000 = 6,720,000 series       ← 6.72 MILLION for ONE metric
```

Prometheus RAM climbs over two days, OOMs at 02:30, crash-loops replaying its WAL, and **every dashboard on that server goes dark** — including the checkout incident the label was added to debug.

**The Collector fix** — strip the label before it reaches the backend, while keeping `merchant_id` as a cheap *trace* attribute for per-merchant drill-down:

```yaml
processors:
  attributes/strip-merchant-id-from-metrics:
    actions:
      - key: merchant_id
        action: delete          # remove from every metric data point

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers:  [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, attributes/strip-merchant-id-from-metrics, batch]
      exporters:  [prometheusremotewrite]
```

Series for that metric drop back to `14 × 4 × merchant_tier(4) × 3 = 672` if you replace identity with category. Per-merchant debugging moves to traces, where `merchant_id` costs nothing.

---

## Head vs Tail Sampling

You met both at junior level. Here are the two extra ideas a middle engineer needs: **rate-limiting sampling** and **consistent/deterministic** decisions.

> **Scenario.** A checkout service: **50,000 req/sec**, ~30 spans/trace, 0.3% error, 0.5% slow (>2s). You want a small bill and zero lost errors or slow traces.

**Head (probabilistic, 1%).** A weighted coin flip at trace start, before the request runs. Cheap and stateless — but blind. It keeps ~1% of *everything*, so it keeps only ~1% of your errors. Good as a flat volume cap; useless for "keep the interesting ones." The OTel `probabilistic_sampler` makes this *deterministic*: it hashes the `trace_id`, so the same trace yields the same decision in every service — a preview of consistent sampling.

**Rate-limiting sampling.** Instead of a percentage, keep at most *N traces per second* (e.g. `spans_per_second: 500`). This caps cost in absolute terms regardless of traffic spikes — useful when a percentage would still blow the budget during a flash sale. The trade: the effective sample *rate* now varies with traffic, which complicates adjusted-count math.

**Tail.** The Collector buffers all spans of each trace until it completes, then applies policies to the *finished* trace:

```text
  policy 1: status == ERROR   → KEEP 100%   (it saw the error)
  policy 2: duration > 2s      → KEEP 100%   (it saw the latency)
  policy 3: everything else    → KEEP 1%     (representative sample)
```

You now keep every error, every slow trace, and 1% of normal traffic — roughly 1.8% of all traces, but the *right* 1.8%. The price: the Collector holds every in-flight trace in memory for the decision window, and **must see all of a trace's spans** — which constrains topology (next section).

**Consistent / deterministic sampling (preview).** If service A keeps a trace but service B independently drops its half, you get a broken, half-empty trace. The fix is that the keep/drop decision is a *function of the `trace_id`* — same ID, same decision, everywhere. Head sampling gets this for free (hash the ID); tail sampling gets it because one collector decides for the whole trace. Full statistical treatment — and the maths of combining head and tail rates honestly — is in [`senior.md`](senior.md).

| | **Head** | **Tail** |
|---|---|---|
| Decided | at trace start | after trace completes |
| Sees if interesting? | No | Yes |
| Memory | ~zero | buffers every in-flight trace |
| Needs all spans co-located? | No | **Yes** |
| Keeps all errors? | only ~sample_rate | **100%** |
| Best for | uniform cap, huge fleets | keeping the traces that matter |

---

## The OTel Collector as Control Point

The Collector is a pipeline of **processors** between receivers and exporters. The cost-relevant ones:

| Processor | Job | Order note |
|---|---|---|
| **`memory_limiter`** | Sheds load before RAM exhaustion. | **First**, always. Protects everything downstream. |
| **`probabilistic_sampler`** | Keep N% of traces by hashing `trace_id`. | Early, to cut volume cheaply. |
| **`tail_sampling`** | Buffer whole traces, keep by policy. | After receive, before `batch`. Gateway tier only. |
| **`filter`** | Drop spans/metrics/logs matching a predicate. | Drop noise (health checks) early. |
| **`attributes`** | Add/delete/rewrite attributes (e.g. strip a label). | Before the data is exported or counted. |
| **`batch`** | Group telemetry for efficient export. | **Last**, just before exporters. |

### Agent vs gateway topology — and why tail sampling forces it

```text
   ┌── agent collectors (one per host/pod) ──┐
   │  receive local OTLP, batch, light filter │ ── no whole-trace view ──┐
   └──────────────────────────────────────────┘                          │
                                                                          ▼
                              ┌──────────── GATEWAY tier ────────────────────────┐
                              │  load-balancing exporter routes by trace_id  ──►  │
                              │  tail_sampling (sees WHOLE traces) ──► backend    │
                              └────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why tail sampling lives at the gateway, not the agent:** an agent only sees the spans emitted on its own host. A trace crosses many services on many hosts, so no single agent ever sees the whole trace. Tail sampling must run where *all spans of a given `trace_id` converge*. You achieve that with a **load-balancing exporter** that routes spans to gateway instances *by `trace_id`* — so every span of one trace lands on the same gateway, which can then make a correct whole-trace decision. Without this routing, scaling the gateway horizontally silently breaks tail sampling: each instance sees a fragment, and "keep all errors" misses the errors whose span landed elsewhere.

This is the operational fact that distinguishes a working tracing deployment from a broken one at scale: **head sampling scales freely; tail sampling requires trace-ID-aware routing into a co-located decision tier.**

---

## Reducing Cost Without Losing Signal

Sampling is one lever. These are the others, ordered by leverage.

- **Aggregate at the source.** A counter incremented a billion times is *one series*; a billion log lines is a billion stored records. Convert "log every request" into "increment a metric per request" and keep logs/traces for the exceptional cases. The biggest savings come from not emitting raw streams you only ever look at in aggregate.
- **Log levels & dynamic filtering.** DEBUG off in prod by default; make the level changeable at runtime, not only by deploy. Use the Collector `filter` processor to drop known-noisy logs (health checks, readiness probes) before they're billed.
- **Structured-log field pruning.** Drop fat fields you never query (full request/response bodies, verbose stack frames on non-errors) in the `attributes` processor. A 1.2 KB line trimmed to 400 B is a two-thirds cut with no loss of the fields you actually search.
- **Span dropping / filtering.** Not every span earns its keep. Internal framework spans, repetitive cache-hit spans, and health-check traces can be dropped with the `filter` processor while keeping the spans that explain latency.
- **Exemplars as the cheap bridge.** Instead of keeping expensive traces to explain a metric spike, attach an *exemplar* — a `trace_id` pointer — to the cheap metric sample. You get "show me one real example of this p99 spike" without paying trace prices for every request. Exemplars are the single best cost/fidelity trade in the toolkit: aggregate cost with on-demand drill-down.

The unifying principle: **keep the aggregate cheap, keep one example per aggregate, drop the rest.** The `caching-strategies` skill's instinct applies here too — you're caching the *representative*, not the whole population.

---

## Retention & Downsampling Tiers

You almost never need 90 days of full-resolution data. Tier it.

| Tier | Resolution | Retention | Cost | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hot** | full (e.g. 15s) | 7–15 days | high (fast storage, indexed) | active debugging, current dashboards |
| **Warm** | downsampled (e.g. 5m) | 30–90 days | medium | trend analysis, capacity planning |
| **Cold** | heavily rolled up (e.g. 1h) | 1–2 years | low (object storage) | year-over-year, compliance |

**Metric downsampling / rollups.** Old high-resolution points are aggregated into coarser ones: 15-second samples become 5-minute averages/max/min. You lose the ability to see a 30-second spike from six months ago — which you almost never need — and cut long-term storage by 20× or more. Tools like Thanos, Cortex, and Mimir do this automatically; vanilla Prometheus relies on **recording rules** to precompute rolled-up series.

**Recording rules for downsampling.** A recording rule precomputes an expensive or high-resolution query into a new, cheaper series at a longer evaluation interval. The rolled-up series is what your long-range dashboards and your cold tier read — far cheaper than re-aggregating raw data at query time.

The discipline: match retention to *how far back you actually look*, not to "more is safer." The fidelity floor (errors, audit, SLO, billing) may have its own legally mandated retention — that's a separate, non-negotiable track.

---

## Code Examples

### Full trace pipeline — `memory_limiter` + `tail_sampling` (errors + latency + 1%)

```yaml
# gateway-collector.yaml — runs in the GATEWAY tier (sees whole traces)
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols: { grpc: {}, http: {} }

processors:
  # 1. ALWAYS first: shed load before RAM exhaustion. Tail sampling buffers
  #    every in-flight trace, so this guard is what keeps the collector alive.
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_percentage: 80          # start refusing data at 80% of the RAM limit
    spike_limit_percentage: 25

  # 2. Tail sampling: decide AFTER the trace completes.
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 10s            # buffer each trace up to 10s before deciding
    num_traces: 200000            # max traces held in memory at once
    expected_new_traces_per_sec: 50000
    policies:
      - name: keep-all-errors
        type: status_code
        status_code: { status_codes: [ERROR] }      # NEVER sample errors
      - name: keep-slow-traces
        type: latency
        latency: { threshold_ms: 2000 }             # keep everything over 2s
      - name: sample-the-rest
        type: probabilistic
        probabilistic: { sampling_percentage: 1 }   # 1% of normal traffic

  # 3. Batch LAST, just before export.
  batch: { send_batch_size: 8192, timeout: 5s }

exporters:
  otlp/backend:
    endpoint: backend:4317

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers:  [otlp]
      processors: [memory_limiter, tail_sampling, batch]   # order matters
      exporters:  [otlp/backend]
```

### Probabilistic (head-style) sampler — a flat, stateless cost cap

```yaml
processors:
  probabilistic_sampler:
    sampling_percentage: 10       # keep 10%, decided by hashing trace_id
    # hash_seed must MATCH across all collectors for consistent decisions
    hash_seed: 22
```

Because the decision is a hash of the `trace_id`, the same trace is kept or dropped identically everywhere the same `hash_seed` is configured — consistent sampling, for free.

### `attributes` processor — delete a high-cardinality label

```yaml
processors:
  attributes/drop-userid:
    actions:
      - key: user_id
        action: delete            # strip the cardinality bomb from metrics
      - key: session_id
        action: delete
```

The same `user_id` stays valuable as a *trace* attribute or *log* field — this only removes it from the metrics pipeline where cardinality is lethal.

### `filter` processor — drop noisy health-check spans

```yaml
processors:
  filter/drop-healthchecks:
    error_mode: ignore
    traces:
      span:
        # OTTL: drop spans for health/readiness endpoints
        - 'attributes["http.route"] == "/healthz"'
        - 'attributes["http.route"] == "/readyz"'
        - 'name == "GET /metrics"'
```

Health checks are high-volume and never interesting; dropping them at the agent removes a large slice of trace volume before it's ever billed.

### Prometheus recording rule — downsample for the long-range tier

```yaml
# rules/downsample.yml — precompute a rolled-up, cheaper series
groups:
  - name: request_rate_5m
    interval: 5m                  # evaluate every 5 minutes, not every scrape
    rules:
      - record: job:http_requests:rate5m
        expr: sum by (job, route, status_class) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))
```

The new `job:http_requests:rate5m` series is what your 90-day dashboards read — cheap to store and instant to query, versus re-aggregating raw counters across months.

### SDK-side head sampler — Go, `ParentBased(TraceIDRatioBased)`

```go
import (
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
)

// Keep ~5% at the SDK as a cheap raw-volume cap. ParentBased ensures a
// child span respects the PARENT's decision, so a trace is never half-kept
// across services — the SDK-side root of consistent sampling.
tp := trace.NewTracerProvider(
	trace.WithSampler(
		trace.ParentBased(trace.TraceIDRatioBased(0.05)),
	),
	trace.WithBatcher(exporter),
)
```

`TraceIDRatioBased` hashes the `trace_id`, so the decision is deterministic; `ParentBased` makes downstream services honour the upstream decision. Pair this cheap SDK cap with gateway tail sampling: the SDK trims raw volume, the gateway ensures the survivors are the useful ones.

---

## Pros & Cons

| Choice | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Head sampling** | Stateless, ~zero memory, scales freely, consistent via `trace_id` hash | Blind — keeps only ~sample_rate of errors; can't preserve the interesting traces |
| **Tail sampling** | Keeps 100% of errors/slow traces; samples only the boring rest | Needs memory per in-flight trace; requires trace-ID-aware routing to one collector |
| **Aggregate at source** | Massive savings — one series vs a billion records; cheap forever | Loses per-event detail; need exemplars/traces to drill back down |
| **Keep raw** | Full fidelity; can answer questions you didn't anticipate | Scales linearly and relentlessly with traffic; the runaway bill |
| **Rate-limiting sample** | Hard absolute cost cap regardless of traffic spikes | Effective rate varies with load → complicates adjusted-count math |
| **Downsampling tiers** | 20×+ long-term storage savings; trends preserved | Lose fine-grained resolution on old data (rarely needed) |

---

## Use Cases

| Situation | What to reach for |
|---|---|
| Trace bill grows with traffic | SDK head cap (`ParentBased(TraceIDRatioBased)`) + gateway `tail_sampling` |
| "We lost the error trace" | `tail_sampling` with a `status_code: [ERROR]` keep-100% policy |
| Metrics bill exploded after a deploy | Find the new label; `attributes … action: delete` in the metrics pipeline |
| Logs are the biggest line item | DEBUG off in prod; `filter` health checks; `attributes` field pruning; retention tiers |
| Need the trace behind a metric spike | **Exemplars** — trace pointer on the metric, no per-request trace cost |
| Old data cheap to forget, recent precious | Hot/warm/cold tiers + recording-rule downsampling |
| Gateway OOMs under load | `memory_limiter` first; cap `num_traces`; shorten `decision_wait` |
| Audit / billing / SLO data | **Never sample** — fidelity floor, 100%, with its own retention |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Never sample away errors, audit/security events, SLO signals, or billing.** Encode this as a `status_code: [ERROR]` keep-100% policy so it's enforced, not just intended.
2. **`memory_limiter` is the first processor in every pipeline.** Tail sampling buffers in-flight traces; without the guard, the collector OOMs under exactly the spike it exists to handle.
3. **Put tail sampling in the gateway tier and route by `trace_id`.** A load-balancing exporter must converge each trace's spans on one instance, or "keep all errors" silently misses errors.
4. **Compute the cardinality product before shipping any metric label.** If the product can grow with users/traffic, it's not a label — move identity to traces/logs/exemplars.
5. **Control cost in the Collector, by config push.** Keep the app emitting; never hard-code sample rates in application code where changing them needs a deploy.
6. **Use head and tail together:** a cheap SDK/`probabilistic_sampler` cap for raw volume, gateway tail to make the survivors useful.
7. **Tier retention to how far back you actually look.** Hot full-resolution for days, downsampled warm for weeks, rolled-up cold for compliance.
8. **Alert on telemetry spend and series count**, not just on the system. A new high-cardinality label should page *you* before it pages finance.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Tail sampling behind a naive load balancer.** Round-robin routing splits a trace's spans across gateways; none sees the whole trace; error policies miss errors. You need `trace_id`-aware routing (the load-balancing exporter), not generic L4 balancing.
- **`memory_limiter` placed late or omitted.** It only protects processors *after* it. Late = useless. Omitted = OOM crash-loop under load, going blind when you most need the data.
- **Dropping a label an alert depends on.** Strip `status_class` to save cardinality and your error-rate alert goes silent. Audit which queries depend on a label before deleting it.
- **`decision_wait` shorter than your slowest trace.** If a trace takes 12s and `decision_wait` is 10s, it's decided before the slow span arrives — the slow trace you wanted is sampled away. Set `decision_wait` above your p99.9 trace duration.
- **Inconsistent `hash_seed` across `probabilistic_sampler` instances.** Different seeds → different decisions for the same trace → half-kept traces. Same seed everywhere.
- **Downsampling the fidelity-floor metrics.** Rolling up your SLO error-budget metric corrupts the number your reliability program runs on. Exclude fidelity-floor signals from aggressive downsampling.
- **Counting from sampled data without `1/sample_rate`.** Rate-limiting sampling makes the effective rate *vary*, so a fixed multiplier is wrong — you need per-trace adjusted counts. (Maths: [`senior.md`](senior.md).)

## Common Mistakes

1. **Tail sampling at the agent tier.** An agent never sees the whole trace; the decision is made on a fragment. Tail belongs at a trace-ID-routed gateway.
2. **No `memory_limiter`**, then surprise when the buffering collector OOMs under load.
3. **`batch` before `tail_sampling`.** You batch *survivors*, not candidates — sampling must run first.
4. **Stripping a label without checking dependent alerts/dashboards**, going blind on error rate.
5. **Identity (`user_id`, `request_id`, full URL) as a metric label.** The #1 cardinality explosion; belongs on traces/logs/exemplars.
6. **Hard-coding sample rates in app code**, so tuning cost needs a redeploy.
7. **One flat retention for everything**, paying hot-tier prices for year-old data nobody queries.
8. **Cutting cost by deleting the signals you need** — gaming "reduce telemetry spend" by sacrificing fidelity (Goodhart). Cross-ref [Engineering Metrics & DORA](../../../../Software-Engineering/quality-engineering/engineering-metrics-and-dora/).

## Tricky Points

1. **Processor order is behaviour.** `memory_limiter` first, `batch` last, sampling before batch, label-drop before the metric is counted. The same processors in a different order do a different thing.
2. **Head sampling scales freely; tail sampling does not.** Head is stateless and embarrassingly parallel. Tail needs trace-ID-aware routing and per-trace memory — adding gateway replicas without the routing *breaks* it.
3. **`probabilistic_sampler` is deterministic, not random.** It hashes the `trace_id`, so with a shared `hash_seed` it's consistent across services — the same property tail sampling gets by deciding centrally.
4. **Exemplars give you trace-level drill-down at metric-level cost** — the single best cost/fidelity trade. Keep the aggregate cheap, attach one example.
5. **Adjusted counts depend on the sampler.** A fixed-rate sampler → multiply by `1/rate`. A rate-*limiting* sampler → the rate varies, so each kept trace carries its own weight. Mixing them naively corrupts your totals. (Full maths: [`senior.md`](senior.md).)
6. **Downsampling is lossy on purpose.** A 5-minute rollup cannot show a 30-second spike from last quarter. That's the right trade for trends — and the wrong trade for an SLO metric you debug at high resolution.

## Test Yourself

1. A histogram has ~14 internal series and labels `method`(4) × `status`(6) × `route`(20). Series? Now add `user_id` (250k). Series? Which collector processor removes it, and from which pipeline?
2. Write, in words, the three `tail_sampling` policies that keep all errors, all traces over 2s, and 1% of the rest.
3. Why must `tail_sampling` run in the gateway tier and not the agent? What collector component makes that work?
4. Order these processors correctly for a trace pipeline: `batch`, `tail_sampling`, `memory_limiter`. Justify each position.
5. Your gateway OOMs under a traffic spike. Name three config changes that help.
6. A trace's spans land on two different gateway instances. What goes wrong with "keep all errors," and how do you fix the routing?
7. You set `decision_wait: 5s` but some traces take 8s. What happens to your slowest traces? Fix it.
8. Design a hot/warm/cold retention plan for HTTP request-rate metrics, and write the recording rule that feeds the warm tier.

## Tricky Questions

**Q1: We added gateway replicas to handle load and now "keep all errors" is missing errors. Why?**

You almost certainly load-balanced spans across replicas with generic (round-robin/L4) routing, so a single trace's spans are split across instances. No replica sees the whole trace, so the error span and the rest of the trace land in different decision contexts. Fix: route by `trace_id` using the **load-balancing exporter**, so every span of one trace converges on the same gateway, which can then make a correct whole-trace decision.

**Q2: Can we just put `tail_sampling` on the agent collectors? They're closer to the app.**

No. An agent only sees spans emitted on its own host, and a trace crosses many hosts. The agent would decide on a fragment — "no error here" — and drop a trace that errored on another host. Tail sampling must run where *all* spans of a `trace_id` converge: the gateway tier, fed by trace-ID-aware routing.

**Q3: Our metrics bill exploded. The on-call wants to shorten log retention. Will that help?**

No — that's a logs-volume lever for a metrics-cardinality problem; separate budgets, separate leaks. Find the metric whose series count spiked (`topk(10, count by (__name__)({__name__=~".+"}))`), identify the new label, and delete it from the metrics pipeline with an `attributes` processor. Match the lever to the driver.

**Q4: We keep 1% with a *rate-limiting* sampler. The dashboard shows 3,000 kept traces — is the real total 300,000?**

Not necessarily. A *fixed-rate* 1% sampler → multiply by 100. But a *rate-limiting* sampler caps at N/sec, so the effective rate varies with traffic — during a spike it might have kept 0.2%, off-peak 5%. A single `1/0.01` multiplier is wrong. Each kept trace needs its own adjusted weight recorded at sample time. (Maths: [`senior.md`](senior.md).)

**Q5: We're paying full-resolution storage prices for two years of metrics. How do we cut it without losing trend data?**

Tier it. Keep 7–15 days hot at full resolution for debugging; downsample to 5-minute points for a 90-day warm tier; roll up to hourly for a 1–2 year cold tier on object storage. Use recording rules (or Thanos/Mimir auto-downsampling) to produce the rolled-up series. You lose fine-grained spikes on old data — which you essentially never query — and cut long-term storage by an order of magnitude. Exclude fidelity-floor metrics (SLO, billing) from aggressive rollup.

**Q6: Exemplars vs keeping every trace — when is an exemplar enough?**

Almost always, for the "explain this metric spike" use case. An exemplar attaches one `trace_id` to a metric sample, so when p99 latency jumps you click straight to one real slow trace — at metric cost, not trace cost. Keep full traces (via tail sampling) for *errors and slow requests* where you need the whole population; use exemplars for the common case of "show me one example of this aggregate."

## Summary

- The **OTel Collector** is the cost control point: a pipeline of processors changed by config push, not by redeploying the app. **Processor order is behaviour** — `memory_limiter` first, `tail_sampling` before `batch`, `batch` last.
- **Cardinality is a product.** A histogram is ~14 series before labels; one identity label (`user_id` × 500k) turns thousands of series into billions and kills the TSDB. Compute the product first; strip the label in `attributes` if it already shipped; move identity to traces/logs/exemplars.
- **Head sampling** is blind, stateless, scales freely, and is consistent via a `trace_id` hash. **Tail sampling** buffers whole traces and keeps the useful ones (errors, slow), but needs per-trace memory and — critically — **all spans of a trace at one collector**.
- That co-location requirement **forces the agent → gateway topology**: agents fan in locally, a load-balancing exporter routes spans *by `trace_id`* to gateways, and tail sampling runs at the gateway where it can see whole traces. Generic load balancing silently breaks "keep all errors."
- **Reduce cost without losing signal** by aggregating at source, pruning log fields, filtering health checks, and using **exemplars** as the cheap bridge from an aggregate to one example trace.
- **Tier retention** (hot/warm/cold) and **downsample** old metrics via recording rules / Thanos-Mimir — but never downsample fidelity-floor signals.
- The fidelity floor — **errors, audit, SLO, billing — is never sampled or downsampled**, and counts derived from sampled data must be scaled by their adjusted weight.

## What You Can Build

- A **production-shaped gateway config**: `memory_limiter` + `tail_sampling` (errors + latency + 1%) + `batch`, fronted by a load-balancing exporter, and a load test proving errors survive while normal traffic samples to 1%.
- A **broken-topology demo**: route a trace's spans across two gateways with round-robin, watch "keep all errors" miss errors, then switch to `trace_id` routing and watch it recover.
- A **cardinality calculator v2**: input a metric's internal series and labels with value counts; output total series and a one-line `attributes` processor that fixes the worst offender.
- A **cost-lever simulator**: a synthetic firehose where toggling each lever (head rate, tail policies, field pruning, retention tier) shows the resulting GB/day and what fidelity you kept.
- An **exemplar drill-down**: instrument a service so a p99 latency spike on a Grafana panel links straight to one real slow trace, with no per-request trace cost.
