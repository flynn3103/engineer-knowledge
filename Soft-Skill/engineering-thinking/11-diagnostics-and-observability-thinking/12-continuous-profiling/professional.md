## Introduction

> Focus: **Continuous profiling stops being "a flame graph I pull up for an incident" and becomes a governed, always-on, fleet-wide signal — with a rollout plan, an overhead SLO, a storage bill, a deploy-gate role, and a security posture. The unit of design is the fleet, not the process.**

At senior level you owned the *correctness and cost of one service's profiles* — diff flame graphs, off-CPU latency hunts, an overhead budget you kept under 2%, symbolization that resolved your binary. At professional level the unit of design is no longer the service. It is the **fleet**: hundreds of processes, a dozen languages, stripped C sidecars, a kernel, JITs, all profiled *continuously*, stored *time-indexed*, *correlated* to the other three signals, and *gating deploys* — under one overhead SLO, one storage budget, and one access-control policy. You are no longer asking "what's the widest leaf in this flame graph?" You are asking "**can I profile every process in the org, in every language, with no per-service instrumentation, keep the whole fleet under a 1% overhead SLO, store a month of profiles affordably, and have a canary's CPU regression fail the deploy automatically — and not leak a customer's data through a stack frame?**"

This is the move from *reading a profile* to *operating a profiling platform*. The senior runs `go tool pprof`. The staff/principal engineer decides **agent-based eBPF vs in-process SDKs** as an org strategy, sets the **overhead budget as a fleet-wide SLO with a kill switch**, builds the **profile storage tier and its retention/downsampling**, wires the **diff-profile regression check into CI/CD**, standardizes **profile labels** so a query spans the fleet, and writes the **access-control and PII policy** for endpoints that expose the most sensitive thing in your system: exactly what your code was doing, line by line, for a real customer.

The reference frame is the **pprof protobuf format** (the lingua franca every tool speaks), the **eBPF profiling agents** (parca-agent, Pyroscope eBPF) that profile *anything* with zero instrumentation, the **columnar profile stores** (Parca/FrostDB, Pyroscope's storage), and the **OpenTelemetry profiling signal** — the emerging standard that makes profiling a first-class OTLP signal alongside metrics, traces, and logs. Everything here is downstream of those.

> If `senior.md` is "make this one service's profiles correct, cheap, and diffable," `professional.md` is "**make the whole fleet emit one coherent, affordable, trace-linked profiling signal with zero per-service work — and make a CPU regression impossible to ship.**"

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** All of [`senior.md`](senior.md) — differential flame graphs (diff = a *delta*, red grew / blue shrank), off-CPU and latency profiling, the ~1–2% overhead budget, symbolization (debug info, stripped binaries), the pprof format basics, the Pyroscope/Parca pipeline.
- **Required:** You can read a flame graph fluently and never confuse *width = aggregate samples* with *time order* (it is **not** a timeline — that is what a trace is for). See [`junior.md`](junior.md).
- **Required:** Working familiarity with metrics, traces, and logs as the other three signals — profiling is the *fourth*, and most of its fleet value is in correlation. See [Metrics — Professional](../04-metrics/professional.md), [Tracing](../05-tracing/README.md).
- **Required:** You have run a fleet of *something* (a Kubernetes cluster, a metrics backend, a log pipeline) at a scale where a 1% per-process tax, or a storage retention decision, *cost real money or capacity*.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to eBPF — what a perf-event program is, why in-kernel sampling needs no application changes. See [Dynamic Instrumentation & eBPF](../13-dynamic-instrumentation-and-ebpf/).
- **Helpful:** You've operated a CI/CD deploy gate (canary analysis, automated rollback) and know where a new check would slot in.
- **Helpful:** You've thought about PII and access control for an observability system before — profiles are not exempt, and stack frames leak more than people expect.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Continuous profiling** | Running a low-overhead sampling profiler permanently on every process in the fleet and storing profiles time-indexed, queryable like metrics. |

| **parca-agent / Pyroscope eBPF** | The two production eBPF whole-system profiling agents — a node-level DaemonSet that profiles every process on the host. |
| **Agent-based profiling** | A node-level agent (often eBPF) profiles all processes externally. No code change in the target. |
| **SDK-based profiling** | An in-process library (Go pprof push, Pyroscope SDK, async-profiler) profiles its own process and pushes profiles out. |
| **pprof format** | The protobuf profile format from Go's pprof, now the industry lingua franca — every tool reads/writes it. |
| **OTLP profiles** | The OpenTelemetry profiling signal: profiles as a first-class OTLP payload, the emerging "fourth signal" standard, with built-in trace correlation. |

| **Profile labels** | Key/value dimensions attached to every profile series (`service`, `version`, `region`, `pod`) — the equivalent of metric labels; what you query and group by. |
| **Profile series** | A unique combination of profile-type + label set over time — the cardinality unit of a profile store, exactly analogous to a metric series. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. eBPF moves profiling from "in every process" to "once per node, for everything"

The senior model is per-process: each service imports an SDK or exposes pprof. The fleet-scale model is **agent-based eBPF**: a single node-level DaemonSet runs a `perf_event` BPF program that samples the on-CPU stack of *whatever* is running — your Go service, a stripped C sidecar, a Python interpreter, the kernel itself — with **zero instrumentation in any of them**. One agent profiles the entire node. This is the difference between "instrument 200 services in 12 languages" and "deploy one DaemonSet." For a heterogeneous fleet, eBPF is the only rollout that scales to *everything* without per-service work.

### 2. The pprof format is the contract; everything speaks it

Just as OTel semantic conventions let one metric query span the fleet, the **pprof protobuf format** is the profiling lingua franca: Go emits it, Parca and Pyroscope store it, `go tool pprof` reads it, the OTel profiling signal is designed around it. Standardizing on pprof (and increasingly OTLP profiles) means your storage, query, and diff tooling is *language-agnostic* — a Rust profile and a Java profile are the same shape in the store. The format *is* the interoperability.

### 3. A profile store is a TSDB for flame graphs, and it has a cardinality bill

A continuous profile store is *metrics for code paths*: time-indexed series keyed by profile-type + labels, stored columnarly (FrostDB, Pyroscope's store). It has the same cost structure as a metrics TSDB — **series count drives storage and RAM**, and an unbounded label (`pod`, raw `endpoint`) is the same cardinality bomb here as on a metric. The professional designs profile *labels* the way they design metric attributes: bounded, queryable, fail-closed. See [Telemetry Cost and Sampling Strategy](../14-telemetry-cost-and-sampling-strategy/).

### 4. The overhead budget becomes a fleet-wide SLO with a kill switch

Senior level kept *one service* under ~2%. Fleet level makes overhead a **governed SLO**: measured continuously across the fleet, alerted when breached, and *automatically disable-able* (a kill switch) per-service or fleet-wide when a profiler misbehaves (a runaway DWARF unwind, a JIT that confuses the agent). Always-on is only sustainable if you can prove — and enforce — that it stays cheap. The kill switch is what lets you say "yes" to default-on.

### 5. Diff profiles are a deploy gate, not just a debugging tool

The senior uses a diff flame graph reactively after a regression. The professional **wires the diff into CI/CD**: the canary's profile is compared to the baseline's, and a function whose CPU share grew beyond a threshold *fails the deploy automatically*. A diff is a **delta** — it shows what *grew* (red) and *shrank* (blue) between two profiles — and that delta is exactly the signal a regression gate needs. Profiling shifts from "explain the regression after it ships" to "block the regression before it ships."

### 6. The fourth signal's superpower is correlation, not standalone use

A profile alone answers "which line burned the resource?" Its *fleet* value is the **hop**: a metric alerts, a trace localizes to a span, and a **span profile** shows the flame graph *for that exact span*. The OTel profiling signal bakes trace correlation into the spec. The professional's job is to make this descent — metric → trace → profile → log — a one-click path across the whole fleet, not an archaeology project. The four signals are one system; profiling closes the "what was the code doing?" gap.

### 7. Profiles are sensitive data and a privileged endpoint — govern them

A stack frame can contain a function name, a file path, sometimes an argument-derived label, and the profiling endpoint reveals *exactly what your code does*. A profile store is a high-value target and a potential PII leak. The professional treats profiling endpoints as **privileged** (auth, internal-only, never public), audits **labels for PII**, and applies **access control** to the store — the same rigor you'd apply to logs, because a profile is arguably more revealing.

---

## Fleet-Wide Rollout Strategy

Rolling continuous profiling out to a fleet is an org project, not a config change. The decisions that define it:

### Opt-in vs default-on

| Posture | When | Trade-off |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Opt-in (per service)** | Early adoption, untrusted overhead, regulated workloads | Slow coverage; the services that most need it (the ones nobody owns) never opt in |
| **Default-on (fleet-wide)** | Mature overhead story, agent-based eBPF, a kill switch exists | Full coverage immediately; *requires* a proven overhead SLO and a kill switch to be safe |

The professional goal is **default-on**, because the value of continuous profiling is *coverage* — the bug lives in the service nobody thought to instrument. But default-on is only responsible once you have (a) a measured, low overhead budget, and (b) a kill switch to disable a misbehaving profiler instantly. eBPF agent-based profiling makes default-on dramatically easier: there's nothing to opt *into* per service — the agent profiles everything on the node.

### Staged rollout

```text
   STAGE 1  one node, one cluster, agent-based eBPF, profiles to a dev store
            → measure REAL overhead under REAL traffic (not a benchmark)
   STAGE 2  one tier-3 service fleet, default-on, overhead SLO dashboards live
            → prove the SLO holds; exercise the kill switch deliberately
   STAGE 3  expand by tier; SDK-based profiling for languages eBPF unwinds poorly (JITs)
            → symbolization pipeline + debuginfo upload working end-to-end
   STAGE 4  default-on fleet-wide; deploy-gate diff checks on tier-1 services
            → profiling is now infrastructure, governed by SLO + access control
```

### The overhead budget as a fleet-wide SLO

The single non-negotiable: **measure the cost of profiling and bound it as an SLO.** Concretely:

- **CPU:** sampling at ~19–100 Hz typically lands well under 1% for eBPF agents; SDKs vary. Measure it per-process (CPU with vs without the profiler) and SLO the p99.
- **Memory:** the agent's in-kernel maps and userspace symbol caches; DWARF unwinding tables can be large — budget RSS per node.
- **Network:** profile upload volume (the storage section prices this).

Alert when the SLO is at risk, and have the **kill switch** (a feature flag / agent config that disables profiling per-service or fleet-wide) ready *before* you go default-on. The kill switch is the thing that makes default-on a defensible decision rather than a gamble.

---

## Agent-Based vs SDK-Based Profiling

The defining architectural choice at fleet scale: profile processes *externally* with a node agent, or *internally* with an in-process SDK.

| Dimension | **Agent-based (eBPF DaemonSet)** | **SDK-based (in-process)** |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Instrumentation | **None** — profiles any process on the node | Per-service: import a library, push profiles |
| Language coverage | Any compiled binary, kernel included; JITs are harder | Whatever the SDK supports; rich runtime context |
| Rollout | One DaemonSet, fleet-wide instantly | N services × M languages to instrument |
| Symbolization | Needs debuginfo (server-side or uploaded) | Often has symbols in-process |
| Runtime context | Limited (kernel sees stacks, not app labels easily) | Rich (can attach app-level labels, span IDs) |
| Off-CPU / custom profiles | Harder (eBPF off-CPU is possible but more work) | Native (Go off-CPU, heap, mutex profiles built in) |
| Overhead control | Centralized at the agent | Per-service; varies by SDK |
| Best for | Heterogeneous fleet, stripped binaries, default-on coverage | Rich language-specific profiles (heap, off-CPU, span labels) |

**The professional answer is usually both, layered.** Agent-based eBPF for *universal CPU coverage* — the floor that profiles everything including the C sidecar nobody owns. SDK-based for the *rich profiles eBPF can't easily get* — Go heap/off-CPU/mutex, JVM allocation with full symbols, span-labeled profiles for trace correlation. The eBPF agent gives you breadth (every process, zero work); the SDK gives you depth (every profile type, full context) where it matters.

---

## eBPF Whole-System Profiling in Depth

This is the professional-tier capability that doesn't exist at junior/middle: profiling **any language, any runtime, even stripped C and the kernel, with zero instrumentation**, from a node-level agent. This is the kernel tech the [Dynamic Instrumentation & eBPF](../13-dynamic-instrumentation-and-ebpf/) roadmap covers in depth; here is the profiling-specific mechanics.

### How the eBPF perf-event profiler samples stacks in-kernel

```text
   perf subsystem fires a sampling event (e.g. every N CPU cycles, ~19-100 Hz)
                          │
                          ▼
   the kernel invokes the attached eBPF program (BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT)
                          │
                          ▼
   the eBPF program reads the CURRENT stack (user + kernel) via bpf_get_stackid /
   a custom unwinder, into a BPF map keyed by (pid, user_stack_id, kernel_stack_id)
                          │   (aggregation happens IN-KERNEL: identical stacks counted)
                          ▼
   userspace agent periodically drains the map, resolves pids → containers/services,
   symbolizes addresses → function names, converts to pprof, pushes to the store
```

The key properties that make this work fleet-wide:

- **Zero instrumentation.** The target process is never modified, recompiled, or restarted. The agent attaches to the *CPU*, not the application. A 10-year-old stripped C binary is profiled the same as a fresh Go service.
- **In-kernel aggregation.** Identical stacks are counted in a BPF map before crossing to userspace, so the agent isn't paying per-sample userspace cost — this is a big part of why eBPF profiling is so cheap.
- **Whole-system.** It captures the kernel stack too, so you see time spent in syscalls, the scheduler, the network stack — invisible to a userspace-only profiler.
- **One agent, every process.** As a DaemonSet, one agent per node profiles every container on it, mapping PIDs back to Kubernetes pods/services for labeling.

### The hard part: stack unwinding for arbitrary binaries

The eBPF program has to *walk the stack* of a process it knows nothing about. That is the central technical challenge of whole-system profiling, and it is where frame pointers vs DWARF (next section) becomes load-bearing. The agent must, in-kernel and fast, reconstruct `main → handler → query → scan` from raw stack memory — for a binary it didn't compile, possibly stripped, possibly a JIT.

### Where eBPF struggles, and why you still need SDKs

- **JIT runtimes (JVM, V8, .NET).** The JIT compiles bytecode to machine code at runtime; the eBPF unwinder sees machine addresses with no static symbol table, and the runtime's stack layout is non-standard. Agents add JIT-specific unwinders/agents (e.g. reading `perf-<pid>.map` files the JVM/V8 write), but coverage is harder than for AOT binaries. For deep JVM profiling, async-profiler (SDK-side) is still superior.
- **Interpreted languages (Python, Ruby).** The C-level stack shows the *interpreter* (`PyEval_EvalFrameEx`), not your Python functions. eBPF agents add interpreter-aware unwinders that walk the interpreter's frame objects to recover Python frames — clever, but interpreter-version-specific and fragile.
- **Off-CPU and non-CPU profiles.** eBPF *can* do off-CPU (sample on scheduler context-switch), heap, and lock profiling, but it's more work and less mature than the language runtime's built-in equivalents. The SDK path is often easier for these.

The professional takeaway: **eBPF agent for universal on-CPU coverage; SDKs to fill the JIT/interpreted/off-CPU gaps.**

## Stack Unwinding — Frame Pointers vs DWARF

Stack unwinding is *the* technical crux of whole-system profiling, and "the frame-pointer debate" is one of the more consequential performance arguments in systems engineering of the last few years.

### Frame-pointer unwinding (cheap, needs a register kept)

When a binary is compiled with frame pointers (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`), the `rbp` register holds the base of the current stack frame, and each frame stores the caller's `rbp` — forming a linked list. Unwinding is a trivial, fast pointer-walk: follow `rbp` up the chain. This is cheap enough to do in-kernel on every sample.

**The catch:** keeping a frame pointer costs ~1 register and a small per-call overhead, so for decades compilers *omitted* it by default (`-fomit-frame-pointer`) as a micro-optimization. The result: most distro binaries shipped *without* frame pointers, and you couldn't cheaply unwind them.

### DWARF / `.eh_frame` unwinding (accurate, expensive)

Without frame pointers, you reconstruct the stack from **DWARF Call Frame Information** (`.eh_frame` tables) — per-instruction-address tables describing how to find the caller's frame. It's accurate and needs no register sacrifice, but it requires *interpreting a small bytecode program per frame per sample*, which is far too expensive to do naively in-kernel. eBPF agents implement DWARF unwinding by **pre-computing compact unwind tables** in userspace and shipping them into BPF maps so the in-kernel unwinder can do lookups quickly — a substantial engineering feat (Parca's and Pyroscope's DWARF unwinders).

### The frame-pointer debate

```text
   FRAME POINTERS ON                       FRAME POINTERS OFF (historical default)
   ─────────────────                       ─────────────────────────────────────
   + cheap, fast, in-kernel unwinding      + ~1 free register, tiny per-call save
   + works for stripped binaries           − unwinding needs DWARF tables (expensive)
   − ~1% runtime cost (varies; often less) − whole-system profilers struggle / DWARF
   → the modern consensus for profilable     → the reason eBPF profilers had to build
     fleets: TURN FRAME POINTERS ON          DWARF unwinders at all
```

The industry has swung toward **frame pointers on**: Fedora (39+) and Ubuntu (24.04+) re-enabled them distro-wide *specifically* to make continuous profiling cheap and accurate, judging the ~1% runtime cost worth the profilability. The professional decision for your own fleet: **compile your services with frame pointers** (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`, or the runtime's equivalent), so the eBPF agent gets cheap, reliable unwinding — and fall back to DWARF unwinding only for third-party binaries you can't recompile.

### Go and JIT challenges

- **Go** historically had its own unwinding quirks (the runtime uses a non-standard calling convention and its own unwinder); modern Go binaries are generally unwindable by the agents, but Go is a frequent source of unwinding edge cases.
- **JITs** (covered above) have no static unwind tables for JIT-compiled code; the agent must consult runtime-emitted symbol maps. This is the least-reliable corner of whole-system unwinding.

---

## The pprof Format and the OTel Profiling Signal

### pprof: the lingua franca

The **pprof protobuf format** (from Go's pprof) became the de-facto profile interchange format. Its shape: a profile is a set of **samples**, each carrying a *stack* (list of locations → functions) and one or more *values* (e.g. cpu nanoseconds, alloc bytes), plus a **sample type** and **labels**. Because every major tool reads and writes pprof — `go tool pprof`, Parca, Pyroscope, the OTel signal — your storage, query, diff, and visualization tooling is *language-agnostic*. A Rust profile, a Python profile, and an eBPF profile are all pprof; one diff engine diffs them all.

```text
   pprof Profile {
     sample_type: [{cpu, nanoseconds}]
     sample:      [{ stack:[loc1,loc2,...], value:[cpu_ns], label:{...} }, ...]
     location/function/mapping tables   (for symbolization)
   }
   → samples aggregate by identical stack; value = the resource. The diff is a DELTA of values.
```

### The OpenTelemetry profiling signal (OTLP profiles)

OTel is standardizing **profiling as the fourth OTLP signal**, alongside metrics, traces, and logs. The significance for a fleet:

- **One protocol for all four signals.** Apps/agents emit OTLP; the OTel Collector receives, processes, and routes profiles just like the other signals — the same collector-in-the-middle control plane you use for metrics now governs profiles.
- **Built-in trace correlation.** The OTLP profiles data model carries trace/span context, so **profile-to-trace correlation is part of the spec**, not a bolted-on hack. A profile sample can reference the span active when it was taken — the foundation of span profiles.
- **pprof-aligned.** The OTLP profiles model is designed to interoperate with pprof, so the existing ecosystem isn't thrown away.

The professional positioning: **standardize the fleet on OTLP profiles where supported**, routed through the OTel Collector, so profiling rides the same pipeline, labeling discipline, and correlation model as your other three signals. The fourth signal becomes a first-class citizen of the observability platform, not a separate silo.

---

## Storage and Cost of Profiles at Scale

Continuous profiling produces a *lot* of data — far more raw volume than metrics — and at fleet scale the storage bill is a real budget line. The professional prices it before turning on default-on.

### The volume math

A single CPU profile is a set of aggregated stacks. The volume scales as:

```text
   raw volume ≈  processes × profile_types × profiles_per_minute × avg_profile_size
              ×  (unique stacks per profile drives size)

   example:  500 processes × 1 type (cpu) × 4 profiles/min × ~15 KB compressed
           ≈ 30 MB/min ≈ 43 GB/day  (CPU only; heap/off-CPU multiply this)
```

That is *raw ingest*; the store's job is to make it affordable to keep. The dominant cost lever is the same as metrics: **profile-series cardinality** (profile-type × label set), because that determines how many distinct time-series the store indexes.

### Time-indexed columnar storage

Modern profile stores use **columnar storage** purpose-built for profile shape:

- **Parca / FrostDB** — an embedded columnar database (Apache Arrow / Parquet lineage) that stores pprof-shaped data column-wise, so queries that touch one label or one sample-type read only the relevant columns. Symbols are deduplicated and stored separately.
- **Pyroscope's storage** — its own time-series-of-profiles store, also column-oriented, with aggressive compression of repeated stacks.

Columnar layout is the right call because profile data is *highly repetitive* (the same stacks recur across samples and across time), so column compression and stack deduplication shrink it dramatically.

### Retention, downsampling, and symbol storage

| Cost component | Lever |
|----------------|-------|
| **Recent high-resolution profiles** | Keep full resolution for a short window (e.g. days–weeks) — this is where incidents and deploy diffs live |
| **Older profiles** | **Downsample** — merge into coarser time windows, keeping the flame graph shape but fewer time points; or drop low-value profile types |
| **Symbolization storage** | Debuginfo can be large; store it deduplicated and separate from samples (Parca's `debuginfod`-style symbol store), so identical binaries share one copy |
| **Profile-series cardinality** | Bound labels (no raw `pod`/`endpoint`); fail-closed label allow-lists, exactly as for metrics |

### The cost trade-off versus metrics and traces

```text
   METRICS  — cheapest per unit; tiny payloads, huge aggregation. Always-on, full fleet, fine.
   TRACES   — sampled (1-10%) precisely BECAUSE per-request volume is high.
   PROFILES — high raw volume, but COLUMNAR + dedup + downsampling make always-on viable
              at ~1-2% overhead; the value (which LINE) justifies the storage.
   LOGS     — volume-driven; often the most expensive to retain at full fidelity.
```

The professional framing: profiling's *storage* cost is real but tamed by columnar storage, stack dedup, and downsampling, while its *compute* overhead stays at the sampling-profiler ~1–2%. Price it against the other signals deliberately — see [Telemetry Cost and Sampling Strategy](../14-telemetry-cost-and-sampling-strategy/) for the cross-signal budget. The right default is "profile everything, keep recent at high resolution, downsample the rest."

---

## Diff Profiles in the Deploy Gate

The senior uses a diff flame graph reactively. The professional makes it a **deploy gate** — automated regression detection in CI/CD.

### The mechanism

```text
   deploy canary (v_new) alongside baseline (v_old) under the same traffic split
                          │
                          ▼
   collect a CPU (and/or alloc) profile for EACH, over the same window, same labels
                          │
                          ▼
   compute the DIFF (delta of per-function values, normalized by total samples)
                          │
                          ▼
   for each function: Δ_share = share_new − share_old
                          │
                          ▼
   FAIL the deploy if any function's CPU share grew > threshold (e.g. +5 pp)
   or total on-CPU samples for the service grew > X% for equal request volume
```

The diff is a **delta** — that is precisely the regression signal. A function that was 8% of CPU and is now 22% lights up red in the diff; the gate fails the canary, and the engineer sees the exact function before the change reaches the full fleet.

### Normalization is the load-bearing detail

You cannot compare raw sample counts — the canary and baseline get different traffic. **Normalize to share-of-total** (fraction of samples), or normalize per unit of work (samples per request). A naive raw-count diff flags a function as "regressed" simply because the canary served more requests. The professional gate compares *shares* or *per-request* cost, never raw totals.

### Profile-based SLO guards

Beyond per-function diffs, you can guard fleet-level profiling SLOs:

- **Allocation regression:** alloc-profile `_sum` per request grew > X% → likely a new per-request allocation → GC pressure incoming.
- **A new hot frame:** a function absent from baseline now in the top-N of the canary → a new code path went hot.
- **Off-CPU regression:** time blocked on a lock/IO grew → a new contention point.

These become *gates* (block the deploy) or *alerts* (page on a fleet-wide profile regression), the same way DORA/SLO guards work for metrics.

## Correlating Profiles with Traces and Metrics

The fourth signal's fleet value is correlation. The professional wires the full descent.

### The metric → trace → profile → log descent

```text
   METRIC   p99 latency spiked at 14:32            (exemplar links to a trace)
      │
      ▼
   TRACE    the slow span is search-svc / db.query (carries trace_id, span_id)
      │
      ▼
   PROFILE  span profile FOR THAT SPAN: 60% in regexp.Compile   ← the line
      │
      ▼
   LOG      "search: recompiled pattern (cache miss)"           ← the why/context
```

### Span profiles — the profiling side of trace correlation

A **span profile** is a profile scoped to a single span (or to a trace), made possible because the profiler records the active **trace ID / span ID** on each sample (via pprof labels or the OTLP profiles trace-context field). Now "show me the flame graph for *this* slow span" is a query, not an estimate. This is the profiling equivalent of metric *exemplars* — exemplars take you metric→trace; span profiles take you trace→profile.

### The plumbing

- **Profiler must see trace context at sample time.** The SDK reads the active span from context and tags samples with `trace_id`/`span_id`. Exactly like metric exemplars, **if the profiler samples outside the span scope, the correlation is lost** — the sample has no trace ID. (eBPF agents have a harder time here, since the kernel doesn't naturally see the app's span context; this is one reason SDK-based profiling matters for correlation.)
- **Common labels across signals.** The four signals must share `service.name`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment`, `region` so a dashboard can pivot metric→trace→profile by the same identity. Label consistency across signals is a governance requirement (next section).
- **The collector ties it together.** Routing all four signals through the OTel Collector with shared resource attributes is what makes the one-click descent work fleet-wide.

The `observability-stack` skill covers wiring the four-signal correlation in a real stack; this page is the profiling slice of that story.

## The Full Relationship Map of the Four Signals

A precise map of when each signal — and continuous vs point-in-time profiling — pays off, because at staff level you allocate observability budget across all of them.

| Signal | Answers | Granularity | Cost model | When it pays |
|--------|---------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| **Metric** | "Is something wrong?" | aggregate number | cheapest; active series | Always-on, full fleet; the alert trigger |
| **Trace** | "Which span/service?" | one request's path | sampled (1–10%) | Localizing across services; the slow span |
| **Log** | "What happened to this event?" | one event | volume-driven, costly | The error message, the context, the audit |
| **Profile (continuous)** | "Which *line* burned the resource?" | function/line, aggregated | ~1–2% CPU + columnar storage | The hot function *in production*, fleet-wide, always |
| **Point-in-time profiling** | "Why is *this function* slow, and how do I fix it?" | function/line, one run | a developer's time | Optimizing a known hot path on a laptop/benchmark |

### Continuous vs point-in-time profiling

These are *complementary*, not competing:

- **Continuous profiling** ([this roadmap](README.md)) *finds* the hot function in production, fleet-wide, with real data and concurrency. It answers "where is the time going right now, across everything?"
- **Point-in-time profiling** ([Quality Engineering → Performance → Profiling](../../../../Software-Engineering/quality-engineering/performance/01-profiling/)) *fixes* a known hot function — the developer reproduces it on a laptop/benchmark, iterates with a profiler, and optimizes. It answers "why is this specific function slow and how do I make it fast?"

The workflow is: **continuous profiling (prod) finds it → point-in-time profiling (laptop) fixes it → continuous profiling (deploy gate) confirms the fix and guards against regression.** The `profiling-techniques` skill is the point-in-time-optimization counterpart; this roadmap is the always-on-discovery side.

### When *not* to reach for profiling

- The question is "what's the error?" → that's a **log**.
- The question is "which service is slow?" → that's a **trace** (then profile the slow one).
- The question is "is the SLO being met?" → that's a **metric**.
- Profiling answers *which line burned the resource* — reach for it after a metric/trace tells you *where*.

---

## Profile Labeling and Governance

A fleet of profiles is only queryable if everyone labels them the same way. Label drift is the same enemy here as metric-name drift on the metrics side.

### Profile labels are profile-series cardinality — design them like metric attributes

Every profile carries labels; the unique combination of profile-type + labels is a **profile series**, and series count drives storage and query cost. The rules are the metrics rules:

| Label | Keep? | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `service.name`, `service.version` | **Yes** | The primary query/group-by; bounded; needed for diffs across versions |
| `deployment.environment`, `region` | **Yes** | Bounded; needed for slicing |
| `pod` / `instance` | **No (or short-retention)** | Churns on every roll → cardinality bomb; you rarely query per-pod flame graphs |
| raw `endpoint` / `user_id` | **No** | Unbounded → blows up profile-series count; analytics, not profiling labels |

Standardize a **profile-label allow-list** that *fails closed*, exactly like the metrics `AllowAttributeKeys` posture — anything not explicitly permitted is dropped before storage.

### Cross-signal label consistency

The labels on profiles **must match** the resource attributes on metrics, traces, and logs (`service.name`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment`, `region`). This is what lets a dashboard pivot from a metric to its profile by the same identity. Govern it the way the metrics fleet standard is governed: a shared resource-builder / agent config that stamps the same identity on all four signals.

### Multi-language fleet standards

- **One profile-label schema** across every language and the eBPF agent — the agent maps Kubernetes pod → service labels so agent-collected profiles carry the *same* labels as SDK-collected ones.
- **pprof / OTLP profiles** as the only on-the-wire format, so the store and tooling are language-agnostic.
- **One profile store and query layer** for the whole fleet (Parca/Pyroscope), not a per-team silo.
- **Governance owner.** Like the metrics standard, profiling is a platform team's product: the agent config, label schema, store, retention, and access policy are owned, versioned, and reviewed — not left to each service.

---

## Security and PII in Profiles

Profiles are *more* sensitive than people assume, and the profiling endpoint is privileged. This is a first-class fleet concern, not an afterthought.

### What a profile can leak

- **Source structure.** Function names, file paths, and the call graph reveal exactly how your system works — a gift to an attacker mapping your code.
- **Labels.** If someone labels profiles with `user_id`, `email`, or a raw request path, that PII lands in the profile store, queryable, and retained.
- **Argument-derived names.** Some profilers can capture limited argument context; symbol names sometimes embed constants. Stack frames can carry more than just `package.Function`.
- **The endpoint itself.** Go's `/debug/pprof` and equivalents let *anyone who can reach them* trigger a profile (a small DoS) and read internals.

### The controls

1. **Profiling endpoints are internal-only and authenticated.** Never expose `/debug/pprof` (or the SDK's push/pull endpoint) publicly — bind to localhost/an admin port behind auth. (The junior-level rule, now a fleet policy.)
2. **Label PII review.** Audit profile labels the way you audit log fields — no `user_id`/`email`/raw-path as a label. The allow-list enforces this *in code*.
3. **Access control on the store.** The profile store reveals your entire codebase's runtime behavior; gate read access (RBAC), and treat it as sensitive as the log store — arguably more so.
4. **Symbol/debuginfo handling.** Debuginfo uploaded for server-side symbolization reveals symbol names; store and transmit it with the same care as source.
5. **Compliance scope.** If you operate under PII/regulatory constraints, profiles are in scope — include the profile store in data-handling, retention, and deletion policies.

The mental model: **a profile is a description of what your code did for a real request.** Treat the profiling pipeline with at least the rigor you apply to logs, and remember that the profiling *endpoint* is a privileged interface, not a debugging convenience.

---

## Real-World Analogies

- **A building's security cameras (eBPF agent).** You don't ask every tenant to install their own camera (SDK per service); one building-wide system (the node agent) watches every room, regardless of who rents it or what language they speak. That's agent-based whole-system profiling: one install, total coverage, no cooperation needed from the tenants.
- **A flight data recorder that's also a smoke detector (deploy gate).** The recorder runs continuously (continuous profiling), but it also *trips an alarm before takeoff* if a gauge reads wrong (the diff gate fails a canary). The same always-on instrument both records history and blocks a bad departure.
- **A universal translator (pprof format).** Every tool speaks a different native tongue, but they all read pprof, so a Rust profile and a Python profile are mutually intelligible in one store and one diff engine. The format is the translator that makes the fleet one corpus.
- **An MRI archive with strict access control (security).** An MRI shows your exact internal tissue (the profile shows your exact code behavior). You keep an archive (the store), but it's locked, access-logged, and never left on a public shelf — because it's the most revealing record you keep.

---

## Mental Models

- **"Continuous profiling is metrics for code paths — and it has a TSDB and a bill to match."** A profile store is a time-series database of flame graphs; design its labels, retention, and cost like a metrics backend.
- **"eBPF profiles the CPU; SDKs profile the runtime."** The agent gives breadth (every process, zero work); the SDK gives depth (heap/off-CPU/span-labeled, full symbols). Use both.
- **"A diff is a delta; a delta is a regression detector."** The thing that makes diff flame graphs useful reactively is the same thing that makes them a deploy gate proactively.
- **"The frame pointer is the price of profilability."** ~1% runtime cost buys cheap, reliable, in-kernel unwinding for the whole fleet. The industry decided it's worth it; decide it for your binaries too.
- **"The fourth signal's job is the last hop."** Metric → trace → profile → log. Profiling closes the gap the other three can't: *which line of code.* Its fleet value is correlation, not standalone use.
- **"A profile is sensitive — it describes what your code did for a real customer."** Govern the endpoint, the labels, and the store accordingly.

## Code Examples

### parca-agent — node-level eBPF profiler as a Kubernetes DaemonSet

```yaml
# parca-agent: one DaemonSet profiles EVERY process on EVERY node, zero app changes.
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: parca-agent
  namespace: parca
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels: { app: parca-agent }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: { app: parca-agent }
    spec:
      hostPID: true                      # see all host processes (required for whole-system)
      containers:
        - name: parca-agent
          image: ghcr.io/parca-dev/parca-agent:latest
          args:
            - --node=$(NODE_NAME)
            - --remote-store-address=parca.parca.svc:7070   # push profiles to the store
            - --remote-store-insecure
            - --profiling-cpu-sampling-frequency=19          # ~19 Hz: very low overhead
            # frame-pointer unwinding is cheap; DWARF unwinder is the fallback for FP-less binaries
          securityContext:
            privileged: true             # eBPF + perf_event require elevated privileges
          env:
            - name: NODE_NAME
              valueFrom: { fieldRef: { fieldPath: spec.nodeName } }
          volumeMounts:
            - { name: debugfs, mountPath: /sys/kernel/debug }   # eBPF/perf needs debugfs
      volumes:
        - name: debugfs
          hostPath: { path: /sys/kernel/debug }
```

The point: **one manifest, fleet-wide, default-on.** No service imports anything. `hostPID` + `privileged` are what let the agent see and unwind every process; the ~19 Hz sampling frequency is the overhead lever. This is why agent-based eBPF is the rollout that scales to "everything."

### Compile with frame pointers — make your fleet cheaply unwindable

```dockerfile
# C/C++: keep frame pointers so the eBPF agent unwinds cheaply (no DWARF tables needed in-kernel).
RUN gcc -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -o myservice main.c

# Rust: keep frame pointers in the release profile.
# Cargo.toml:  [profile.release]  force-frame-pointers = true   (or RUSTFLAGS="-C force-frame-pointers=yes")

# Go: modern Go keeps frame pointers on amd64/arm64 by default — generally unwindable as-is.
```

The ~1% runtime cost of keeping frame pointers buys reliable, cheap whole-system unwinding. For binaries you can't recompile (third-party), the agent falls back to DWARF unwinding from `.eh_frame`.

### SDK-based push — Go service with rich profile types + trace correlation

```go
import (
    "github.com/grafana/pyroscope-go"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace"
)

// SDK-based profiling FILLS THE GAPS eBPF can't easily get: heap, mutex, block, goroutine,
// and SPAN-LABELED samples for trace correlation.
func initProfiling(service, version, env string) (*pyroscope.Profiler, error) {
    return pyroscope.Start(pyroscope.Config{
        ApplicationName: service,
        ServerAddress:   "http://pyroscope.observability.svc:4040",
        // Fleet-consistent labels — MUST match metric/trace/log resource attributes.
        Tags: map[string]string{
            "service_version": version,
            "environment":     env,
            // NO pod/instance/user_id here — same fail-closed label discipline as metrics.
        },
        ProfileTypes: []pyroscope.ProfileType{
            pyroscope.ProfileCPU,
            pyroscope.ProfileAllocSpace,   // heap — eBPF can't easily get this
            pyroscope.ProfileMutexCount,   // contention
            pyroscope.ProfileGoroutines,   // leaks
        },
    })
}

// Span profiles: tag the goroutine with the span context so samples carry trace_id/span_id.
// If you sample OUTSIDE the span scope, the correlation is lost (same trap as metric exemplars).
func handleWithSpanProfile(ctx context.Context, span trace.Span) {
    pyroscope.TagWrapper(ctx, pyroscope.Labels(
        "trace_id", span.SpanContext().TraceID().String(),
    ), func(c context.Context) {
        doExpensiveWork(c) // samples taken here link back to THIS span
    })
}
```

### Deploy-gate diff check — fail the canary on a CPU-share regression

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# deploy-gate: compare canary vs baseline CPU profiles; fail if any function's CPU SHARE grew > threshold.
# Diff = a DELTA of per-function shares, NORMALIZED so different traffic volumes don't false-positive.
import sys, requests

THRESHOLD_PP = 5.0   # fail if any function's CPU share grew > 5 percentage points

def fetch_shares(service, version, window):
    # query the profile store (Parca/Pyroscope) for cpu profile, grouped by function
    r = requests.get("http://parca.parca.svc:7070/api/profile", params={
        "service": service, "version": version, "window": window, "type": "cpu",
    })
    samples = r.json()["functions"]               # [{ "name":..., "value":... }, ...]
    total = sum(f["value"] for f in samples) or 1
    return {f["name"]: f["value"] / total for f in samples}   # NORMALIZE to share-of-total

def main(service, baseline_ver, canary_ver):
    base = fetch_shares(service, baseline_ver, "10m")
    cand = fetch_shares(service, canary_ver,   "10m")
    regressions = []
    for fn, cand_share in cand.items():
        delta_pp = (cand_share - base.get(fn, 0.0)) * 100
        if delta_pp > THRESHOLD_PP:
            regressions.append((fn, delta_pp))
    if regressions:
        print("CPU REGRESSION — failing deploy gate:")
        for fn, d in sorted(regressions, key=lambda x: -x[1]):
            print(f"  {fn}: +{d:.1f} pp CPU share (canary {canary_ver} vs {baseline_ver})")
        sys.exit(1)                                # block the deploy
    print("No CPU-share regression > %.1f pp. Gate passed." % THRESHOLD_PP)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(*sys.argv[1:4])
```

`fetch_shares` normalizes to share-of-total — the load-bearing detail. A raw-count diff would flag a function as "regressed" just because the canary served more traffic. The gate compares *shares*, not raw samples.

### OTel Collector — route profiles as the fourth OTLP signal

```yaml
# The OTel Collector receives PROFILES (OTLP) alongside metrics/traces/logs — one control plane.
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc: { endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 }
processors:
  resource:
    attributes:                          # stamp the SAME identity as the other three signals
      - { key: service.namespace, value: payments, action: upsert }
  batch: {}
exporters:
  otlp/pyroscope:
    endpoint: pyroscope.observability.svc:4040
service:
  pipelines:
    profiles:                            # profiles pipeline — first-class, like traces/metrics
      receivers:  [otlp]
      processors: [resource, batch]
      exporters:  [otlp/pyroscope]
```

Routing profiles through the collector means cross-signal label consistency, central governance, and backend-swappability — the same collector-in-the-middle payoff you get for metrics.

## Worked Example — Rolling Out Fleet-Wide Profiling

You're the platform engineer. The org has ~400 services across Go, Java, Python, Node, Rust, plus stripped C sidecars and a Kubernetes fleet. Leadership wants "the fourth signal" — always-on profiling — without a per-team instrumentation project and without blowing the observability budget. Here is the rollout, end to end.

**Step 1 — pick the spine: eBPF agent for breadth, SDKs for depth.** Deploy **parca-agent (or Pyroscope eBPF) as a DaemonSet** for universal on-CPU coverage — one manifest profiles every process, including the C sidecars nobody owns and the kernel. Layer **SDKs** (Go pprof/Pyroscope, async-profiler for JVM, py-spy/Pyroscope for Python) only where you need heap/off-CPU/span-labeled profiles the agent can't easily get. Breadth from the agent, depth from SDKs.

**Step 2 — make the fleet unwindable.** Mandate **frame pointers on** in the build toolchain (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`, Rust `force-frame-pointers`, modern Go is fine by default). This makes the eBPF agent's unwinding cheap and reliable, and is the single highest-leverage decision for whole-system profile quality. DWARF unwinding is the fallback for third-party binaries.

**Step 3 — set the overhead SLO and build the kill switch.** Before default-on: measure real per-process overhead under real traffic (Stage 1), set an SLO (`p99 profiling overhead < 1%`), dashboard it, and ship a **kill switch** (agent feature flag + per-service opt-out) so a misbehaving profiler can be disabled instantly. Default-on is only defensible once the SLO and kill switch exist.

**Step 4 — standardize labels and format.** One **profile-label schema** (`service`, `version`, `environment`, `region`) matching the resource attributes on metrics/traces/logs, enforced by a **fail-closed allow-list** (no `pod`/`user_id`). One on-wire format: **pprof / OTLP profiles**, routed through the OTel Collector. The agent maps pod → service so agent profiles carry the same labels as SDK profiles.

**Step 5 — build the storage tier and its budget.** Stand up **Parca/FrostDB (or Pyroscope)** columnar storage. Set retention: full resolution for ~2 weeks (incidents + deploy diffs live here), **downsample** older profiles, dedup symbols in a separate symbol store. Price the volume (volume math above) against the cross-signal budget — see [Telemetry Cost and Sampling Strategy](../14-telemetry-cost-and-sampling-strategy/).

**Step 6 — wire correlation.** Enable **span profiles** (SDK tags samples with `trace_id`/`span_id`) and ensure metrics carry **exemplars**, so the full descent metric → trace → profile → log is one click. Shared resource attributes across all four signals make the pivot work.

**Step 7 — add the deploy gate.** For tier-1 services, run a **canary diff check** in CI/CD: compare canary vs baseline CPU/alloc profiles (normalized to share), fail the deploy on a function whose CPU share grew > 5 pp or whose per-request allocations grew > X%. The regression is blocked *before* it reaches the fleet.

**Step 8 — govern security.** Profiling endpoints internal-only + authenticated; label PII review (no `user_id`/`email`); RBAC on the store; debuginfo handled as sensitive; profile store in compliance scope.

**The outcome:** every process in a 400-service, multi-language fleet is profiled continuously with *zero per-service instrumentation* (the agent) plus rich profiles where they matter (SDKs); the whole thing stays under a 1% overhead SLO with a kill switch; profiles are stored affordably with downsampling; a CPU regression fails the canary automatically; and a latency spike is one click from its flame graph. **That coverage, that gate, and that correlation are the deliverable — and every piece was a platform decision made once, not 400 times.**

---

## A Real Profiling-Caught Regression, Walked Through

A walk-through in the register of an incident timeline, because a profiling-caught regression is a *prevented* incident.

**Context (deploy at 09:14 UTC):** `checkout-api v7.3` enters canary at 5% traffic. The fleet runs eBPF agent profiling (CPU) plus the Go SDK (alloc, off-CPU), and tier-1 services have a deploy-gate diff check.

**Step 1 — the gate runs automatically (09:24).** After a 10-minute soak, the CI diff check pulls the canary's and baseline's CPU profiles, normalizes both to share-of-total, and diffs.

**Step 2 — the diff lights up red.** One function jumped: `encoding/json.(*decodeState).object` went from 6% to 24% of CPU share — a **+18 pp delta**. The gate's threshold is +5 pp. It fails the deploy and posts the diff flame graph to the PR.

**Step 3 — read the delta, not the absolute.** The diff (a *delta*) shows red concentrated under `json.Unmarshal` called from a new `validateCart` path. The baseline barely touched it; the canary spends a quarter of its CPU there. Because the gate normalized to *share* (canary and baseline served different volumes), this isn't a traffic artifact — it's a real per-request cost increase.

**Step 4 — confirm with the alloc profile.** The Go SDK's alloc diff shows the same path allocating 3× more bytes per request — `validateCart` unmarshals the entire cart into a fresh struct on *every* item, instead of once. The off-CPU profile is flat: it's pure on-CPU + allocation, not blocking.

**Step 5 — the root cause.** `v7.3` added per-item cart validation that re-parses the whole cart JSON inside a loop — O(items²) unmarshalling. On a laptop with a 2-item test cart it was invisible; under real carts (dozens of items) it's a CPU and GC disaster. **This is exactly the prod-only bug continuous profiling exists for** — the test workload never hit it.

**Step 6 — the fix and the confirmation.** Parse once, validate in-memory. `v7.4` re-enters canary; the diff gate now shows `json.object` *back at 6%* (blue in the diff — it shrank to baseline). The gate passes. The fix is *confirmed by the same tool that caught the regression*.

**Step 7 — why this never reached the fleet.** Without the gate, `v7.3` rolls to 100%, p99 latency and GC pauses climb, an alert fires, an SRE pages, someone eventually pulls a profile and finds `json.object` — an *incident*. With the gate, the diff caught it at 5% canary in 10 minutes, automatically, before a single non-canary customer was affected.

**Lessons:**
1. **A diff is a delta, and a delta is a regression detector** — the same flame-graph diff a senior reads reactively, wired into the gate, blocks the regression proactively.
2. **Normalize to share, never raw counts** — the canary served different traffic; only the share-normalized diff distinguishes a real regression from a volume artifact.
3. **The bug was prod-only** — synthetic test carts never triggered the O(items²) path; continuous production profiling (and the gate built on it) is the only thing that sees it.
4. **The same tool caught *and* confirmed the fix** — diff red → fix → diff blue is the full loop, automated.

## Use Cases

- **"We have 400 services in 12 languages and can't instrument them all."** → agent-based eBPF DaemonSet: one manifest, universal on-CPU coverage, zero per-service work; SDKs layered for depth.
- **"A deploy regressed CPU and we found out from a latency alert hours later."** → deploy-gate diff check: compare canary vs baseline profiles (normalized to share), fail the deploy on a function whose CPU share grew > threshold.
- **"p99 spiked; finding the cause is 30 minutes of correlation."** → span profiles + exemplars: one-click metric → trace → profile → log descent.
- **"We profile a Go service but can't see the stripped C sidecar."** → eBPF whole-system profiling: it profiles any binary, stripped or not, including the kernel.
- **"Our profile storage bill is unbounded."** → columnar store (FrostDB/Pyroscope) + symbol dedup + retention/downsampling + bounded profile labels.
- **"eBPF can't unwind our binaries cheaply."** → turn frame pointers on fleet-wide (`-fno-omit-frame-pointer`); DWARF fallback for third-party.
- **"We can't turn profiling on by default — what if it's expensive?"** → overhead SLO + measured budget + a kill switch; eBPF at ~19 Hz keeps it well under 1%.
- **"A profile leaked a customer ID in a label."** → fail-closed profile-label allow-list, PII review, RBAC on the store, internal-only authenticated endpoints.

parca-agent DaemonSet → universal on-CPU coverage, zero instrumentation (the floor)
SDK (Pyroscope/pprof) → heap, off-CPU, mutex, span-labeled profiles (the depth, where it matters)
```

### Pattern 2 — Frame pointers on, DWARF as fallback

```dockerfile
RUN gcc -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer ...   # cheap in-kernel unwinding; DWARF only for FP-less binaries
```

### Pattern 3 — Fail-closed profile labels (match the other signals)

```go
Tags: map[string]string{ "service_version": ver, "environment": env } // NO pod/user_id; allow-list
```

### Pattern 4 — Span profile recorded inside the span scope

```go
pyroscope.TagWrapper(ctx, pyroscope.Labels("trace_id", traceID), func(c context.Context) { work(c) })
// outside the scope → no trace_id on samples → correlation lost (same trap as metric exemplars)
```

### Pattern 5 — Diff = normalized delta = the gate signal

```text
Δ_share(fn) = share_canary(fn) − share_baseline(fn)   # NORMALIZE; raw counts false-positive on traffic
fail deploy if max Δ_share > threshold                 # the diff is the regression detector
```

### Pattern 6 — Profiling endpoint is privileged

```go
mux.HandleFunc("/debug/pprof/", pprof.Index)
http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:6060", mux)  // localhost/admin port + auth — NEVER public
```

### Pattern 7 — Retention tiering for the profile store

```text
recent (≤2w): full resolution   |   older: downsample (coarser windows)   |   symbols: deduped, separate
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Lead with agent-based eBPF for coverage.** One DaemonSet profiles everything in every language with zero per-service work — that breadth is the whole point of continuous profiling. Layer SDKs for the depth (heap/off-CPU/span labels) eBPF can't easily reach.
2. **Turn frame pointers on fleet-wide.** ~1% runtime cost buys cheap, reliable in-kernel unwinding. It's the highest-leverage decision for whole-system profile quality; DWARF unwinding is the fallback for binaries you can't recompile.
3. **Make overhead a fleet-wide SLO with a kill switch.** Measure real overhead under real traffic, bound it (`< 1%`), alert on it, and be able to disable a misbehaving profiler instantly. The kill switch is what makes default-on responsible.
4. **Standardize on pprof / OTLP profiles and one store.** A language-agnostic format and a single columnar store (Parca/FrostDB, Pyroscope) make query, diff, and tooling fleet-wide rather than per-team.
5. **Design profile labels like metric attributes — fail closed.** Bounded, queryable, consistent with the other three signals' resource attributes; no `pod`/`user_id`. Series count is the storage bill.
6. **Wire the deploy gate.** Diff canary vs baseline, normalized to share, and fail the deploy on a function whose CPU/alloc share grew beyond threshold. Block the regression before it ships.
7. **Make correlation one click.** Span profiles + metric exemplars + shared labels → metric → trace → profile → log descent across the fleet. The fourth signal's value is the hop.
8. **Tier the storage.** Full resolution for the recent window, downsample older profiles, dedup symbols separately, bound label cardinality. Price it against the cross-signal budget.
9. **Treat profiles as sensitive.** Internal-only authenticated endpoints, PII review on labels, RBAC on the store, debuginfo handled with care, profiles in compliance scope.
10. **Own it as a platform product.** Agent config, label schema, store, retention, gate, and access policy are versioned, reviewed, and owned — not reinvented per service.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **JIT/interpreted unwinding gaps.** The eBPF agent sees the *interpreter* or unsymbolized JIT addresses for JVM/V8/Python unless interpreter-aware unwinders are configured — and those are version-specific and fragile. Fall back to SDK-based profiling (async-profiler, py-spy) for deep coverage of those runtimes.
- **Frame-pointer-less third-party binaries.** A vendored binary compiled with `-fomit-frame-pointer` won't FP-unwind; the agent needs DWARF tables from its `.eh_frame`, which may be stripped. You may get truncated stacks for binaries you can't recompile.
- **Span profile recorded outside the span scope.** If the profiler samples on a goroutine/thread where the span context didn't propagate (a worker pool, a background flush), samples carry no `trace_id` and the trace correlation is lost — the same trap as metric exemplars.
- **Diff on raw counts.** Comparing canary vs baseline by raw sample count flags functions as "regressed" simply because the canary got more traffic. Always normalize to share-of-total or per-request cost.
- **Unbounded profile labels.** `pod`, `instance`, or raw `endpoint` as a profile label is a profile-series cardinality bomb, exactly as on a metric — it balloons store size and churns on every roll.
- **Overhead from DWARF unwinding.** When frame pointers are off and the agent DWARF-unwinds, per-sample cost rises; a fleet with FP-less binaries can blow the overhead SLO. Frame pointers on is the fix.
- **The kill switch you never built.** Going default-on without a way to disable a misbehaving profiler means your only option during an overhead incident is a fleet-wide redeploy. Build the kill switch *before* default-on.
- **Symbolization drift.** If the debuginfo for a deployed binary isn't uploaded/available, profiles show hex addresses, not function names. Tie symbol upload to the build/deploy so every running binary has matching symbols.
- **PII in labels or symbols.** A label set to a user ID, or a symbol embedding a constant, lands in the store and is retained and queryable. Review labels; treat the store as sensitive.
- **Public profiling endpoint.** `/debug/pprof` (or the SDK endpoint) reachable publicly leaks internals and enables a profile-triggering DoS. Internal-only, authenticated, always.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Instrumenting 400 services by hand** instead of deploying one eBPF agent DaemonSet for universal coverage.
2. **Shipping FP-less binaries** and then wondering why whole-system profiles have truncated stacks or high overhead — turn frame pointers on.
3. **Going default-on without an overhead SLO or kill switch**, so a misbehaving profiler can only be stopped by a fleet redeploy.
4. **Diffing raw sample counts** in the deploy gate, false-positiving on traffic differences instead of normalizing to share.
5. **Unbounded profile labels** (`pod`, `user_id`, raw path) blowing up profile-series cardinality and the storage bill.
6. **Sampling outside the span scope**, so span profiles carry no trace ID and the trace correlation silently fails.
7. **Treating eBPF as a complete solution** for JIT/interpreted runtimes, missing that JVM/Python need SDK-based depth.
8. **No retention/downsampling policy**, so the profile store grows unbounded and the bill is the first signal.
9. **Exposing profiling endpoints publicly** or putting PII in labels — treating profiles as non-sensitive.
10. **Building profiling as a per-team silo** instead of a governed platform with one store, one label schema, one access policy.

---

## Tricky Points

- **eBPF profiles *anything* — but unwinding is the catch.** Zero instrumentation is real, but only as good as the agent's ability to walk the stack; FP-less binaries and JITs are where the magic frays. Frame pointers on + SDK fallback close most of the gap.
- **A diff is a *delta*, not a comparison of two pictures.** Red = grew, blue = shrank, normalized. The deploy gate reads the delta; the senior reads the same delta reactively. Same artifact, two timings.
- **Profile-series cardinality is the storage bill, exactly like metric series.** A profile store is a TSDB for flame graphs; an unbounded label is the same bomb here as there.
- **Span profiles are the trace→profile hop; exemplars are the metric→trace hop.** They're symmetric correlation mechanisms, and both require the identity (trace ID) to be present *at sample time* — record inside the scope.
- **Frame pointers cost ~1% but the industry turned them back on anyway.** Fedora/Ubuntu re-enabled them distro-wide *for profilability* — a rare case of the ecosystem paying a runtime tax for observability. Decide the same for your binaries.
- **Continuous and point-in-time profiling are complementary, not competing.** Continuous *finds* it in prod, fleet-wide; point-in-time *fixes* it on a laptop. The gate uses continuous to *confirm* the fix.
- **The OTel profiling signal makes profiles a peer of the other three** — same OTLP protocol, same collector, built-in trace correlation. The fourth signal stops being a silo.
- **A profile is the most revealing record you keep.** It describes exactly what your code did for a real request. Govern it like logs, or more strictly.

## Test Yourself

1. Why does agent-based eBPF profiling scale to a heterogeneous fleet in a way that per-service SDK instrumentation doesn't? Name one thing the SDK still does better.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The eBPF agent profiles *any* process on the node with zero instrumentation — one DaemonSet covers every service in every language, including stripped binaries and the kernel — so coverage is independent of language count and per-team cooperation. SDKs require importing a library in each of N services × M languages. The SDK still does better at *depth*: heap/off-CPU/mutex profiles, full symbols, and span-labeled samples for trace correlation, which eBPF gets harder or not at all (especially for JIT/interpreted runtimes).
</details>

2. Explain the frame-pointer debate. Why did the industry re-enable frame pointers, and what does it buy continuous profiling?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Frame pointers (`rbp` holding each frame's base, linked up the stack) make unwinding a cheap pointer-walk doable in-kernel on every sample. Compilers historically omitted them (`-fomit-frame-pointer`) to free a register and save a tiny per-call cost. Without them, unwinding needs DWARF/`.eh_frame` interpretation, which is far too expensive to do naively in-kernel. The ~1% runtime cost of keeping frame pointers buys cheap, reliable, accurate whole-system unwinding — so Fedora/Ubuntu re-enabled them distro-wide specifically to make continuous profiling viable.
</details>

3. In a deploy-gate diff check, why must you normalize to share-of-total instead of comparing raw sample counts?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The canary and baseline serve different traffic volumes, so a function that handles more requests on the canary will have more raw samples even with identical per-request cost. Comparing raw counts false-positives on traffic differences. Normalizing to share-of-total (or per-request cost) isolates a real per-request regression — a function whose *fraction* of CPU grew — from a mere volume artifact.
</details>

4. What is a span profile, and what is the one condition required for it to work? How does it relate to metric exemplars?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A span profile is a profile scoped to (and queryable by) a single span/trace, made possible by tagging each sample with the active `trace_id`/`span_id`. The required condition: the trace context must be active *at sample time* — if the profiler samples outside the span scope (a worker/background goroutine without context propagation), the sample has no trace ID and correlation is lost. It's symmetric to metric exemplars: exemplars give the metric→trace hop, span profiles give the trace→profile hop, and both need the identity present at record/sample time.
</details>

5. Why is a profile store's cost structure like a metrics TSDB, and what's the equivalent of the cardinality bomb?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A profile store is time-indexed series keyed by profile-type + labels, stored columnarly — exactly a TSDB for flame graphs. Series count (profile-type × label set) drives storage and RAM. The cardinality bomb equivalent is an unbounded profile label (`pod`, `instance`, raw `endpoint`/`user_id`): it explodes the profile-series count and churns on every deploy/roll. The fix is the same — a fail-closed label allow-list — plus columnar storage, symbol dedup, and retention/downsampling.
</details>

6. Name three security/PII concerns specific to profiling and the control for each.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
(1) The profiling *endpoint* leaks internals and enables a profile-triggering DoS → internal-only, authenticated, never public. (2) *Labels* can carry PII (`user_id`, `email`, raw path) → fail-closed allow-list + PII review. (3) The *store* reveals your codebase's runtime behavior (function names, call graph) → RBAC on read access, treat as sensitive as (or more than) logs, include in compliance scope. (Also: debuginfo reveals symbol names — handle with care.)
</details>

7. When do you reach for continuous profiling vs point-in-time profiling vs a trace vs a metric? Give the one-line role of each.

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Metric: "is something wrong?" — the always-on alert trigger. Trace: "which span/service?" — localize across services. Continuous profiling: "which *line* burned the resource, in prod, fleet-wide?" — find the hot function. Point-in-time profiling: "why is *this* function slow and how do I fix it?" — optimize a known hot path on a laptop/benchmark. The flow: metric/trace tell you where → continuous profiling finds the line → point-in-time fixes it → continuous profiling (deploy gate) confirms and guards.
</details>

8. Why is the OTel profiling signal significant for a fleet beyond "another format"?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
It makes profiling a first-class OTLP signal: the same protocol, the same OTel Collector control plane, and the same label/governance discipline as metrics/traces/logs — so profiles stop being a silo. Critically, trace correlation is *part of the spec* (samples carry trace/span context), so span profiles and the metric→trace→profile descent are standardized, not bolted on. And it's pprof-aligned, so the existing ecosystem carries over.
</details>

## Summary

- **The unit of design is the fleet.** Continuous profiling at professional level is a governed, always-on, fleet-wide signal with a rollout plan, an overhead SLO, a storage budget, a deploy-gate role, a correlation story, and a security posture — not a flame graph you pull up for an incident.
- **eBPF agent for breadth, SDK for depth.** A node-level eBPF DaemonSet (parca-agent, Pyroscope eBPF) profiles *any* process in *any* language with zero instrumentation — even stripped C and the kernel — by sampling stacks in-kernel via a `perf_event` BPF program. SDKs fill the heap/off-CPU/span-labeled gaps and the JIT/interpreted runtimes eBPF unwinds poorly.
- **Unwinding is the technical crux.** Frame-pointer unwinding is a cheap in-kernel pointer-walk; DWARF unwinding (for FP-less binaries) is accurate but expensive. The industry re-enabled frame pointers distro-wide for profilability — do the same fleet-wide, with DWARF as the fallback.
- **pprof is the lingua franca; OTLP profiles are the future.** The pprof format makes tooling language-agnostic; the OpenTelemetry profiling signal makes profiles a first-class OTLP signal — same collector, same governance, with trace correlation built into the spec.
- **A profile store is a TSDB for flame graphs.** Columnar storage (FrostDB, Pyroscope) + symbol dedup + retention/downsampling make always-on affordable; profile-series cardinality is the bill, so bound labels exactly as you bound metric attributes.
- **Diff profiles gate deploys.** A diff is a *delta* — normalized canary-vs-baseline — and that delta is the regression signal: fail the deploy on a function whose CPU/alloc share grew beyond threshold. Normalize to share, never raw counts.
- **The fourth signal's value is correlation.** Span profiles (trace→profile) mirror metric exemplars (metric→trace); together they make the metric→trace→profile→log descent one click. Both need the identity present at sample time — record inside the span scope.
- **Continuous and point-in-time profiling are complementary.** Continuous *finds* the hot function in prod fleet-wide; [point-in-time profiling](../../../../Software-Engineering/quality-engineering/performance/01-profiling/) *fixes* it on a laptop; the gate uses continuous to *confirm* the fix.
- **Profiles are sensitive.** A profile describes exactly what your code did for a real customer; govern the endpoint (internal + auth), the labels (PII review, fail-closed allow-list), and the store (RBAC, compliance scope) like logs, or more strictly.

---

## What You Can Build

- A **fleet profiling platform**: an eBPF agent DaemonSet (parca-agent/Pyroscope) for universal coverage + a layered SDK story for depth, one columnar store, one label schema, one access policy — default-on, behind an overhead SLO and a kill switch.
- A **deploy-gate diff checker**: a CI/CD step that pulls canary and baseline profiles, normalizes to share, and fails the deploy on a function whose CPU/alloc share grew beyond a threshold — with the diff flame graph posted to the PR.
- An **overhead-SLO monitor + kill switch**: continuous measurement of per-process profiling overhead, an SLO dashboard/alert, and a feature-flag kill switch to disable profiling per-service or fleet-wide instantly.
- A **frame-pointer audit**: a tool that scans deployed binaries for missing frame pointers and flags the ones forcing the agent into expensive DWARF unwinding.
- A **profile-label linter**: a fail-closed allow-list enforcer that rejects unbounded/PII labels (`pod`, `user_id`, raw path) before profiles reach the store, and checks consistency with the metric/trace/log resource attributes.
- A **span-profile validator**: confirms recorded samples carry resolvable `trace_id`/`span_id` across each SDK, catching the "sampled outside the span scope" correlation gap.
- A **storage cost estimator**: given process count, profile types, sampling frequency, and retention/downsampling policy, projects the raw volume, stored volume, and dollar cost — priced against the cross-signal budget.
- A **four-signal correlation drill**: a runbook + dashboard that walks metric → trace → profile → log for a real latency spike, proving the one-click descent works fleet-wide.
