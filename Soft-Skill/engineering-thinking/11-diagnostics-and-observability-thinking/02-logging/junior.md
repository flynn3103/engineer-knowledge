## Introduction

> Focus: **What is a log line?** and **Why does a program need them at all?**

A **log line** is a program's way of telling its operator *"this just happened."* It is timestamped, it has a level of importance, and — if the author was disciplined — it carries enough context that a stranger reading it at 3am can piece together what the program was doing. Logging is not glamorous. No user has ever installed an app because of its logs. And yet the difference between a system that can be diagnosed in fifteen minutes and one that takes three days is almost entirely *the quality of its logs*.

If error handling is *"how my code expresses failure to its caller"*, logging is *"how my running program reports what it's doing to its operator."* The audience is different — humans staring at a terminal, or a search box in a log aggregator — and so the discipline is different too. A function's return value is consumed by other code; a log line is consumed by another *human*, often weeks later, often half-asleep.

This page is your first map. We'll cover what a log line should contain, why every language has a `logging` module instead of just `print`, what the six standard severity levels mean and when to use each, how to use the standard library in Python / Go / Java / Node, and the half-dozen mistakes everyone makes the first time. The next level (`middle.md`) goes into structured logging, log handlers, and formatters; `senior.md` covers correlation IDs, sampling, and the move from "log file" to "event stream"; `professional.md` covers logging as a *system design* concern.

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a junior:** Most of the "junior" production incidents you'll cause are not because your code is wrong — it's because **when your code went wrong, nobody could tell what it had been doing**. Good logs are how you stop being the person who needs to be paged to explain *"oh, I know what that was"*. Bad logs are how you become that person forever.

## Prerequisites

What you should already know before reading this page:

- **Required:** How to print something to the terminal in at least one language (`print("hi")`, `fmt.Println("hi")`, `System.out.println("hi")`, `console.log("hi")`).
- **Required:** What a function is, what a return value is, what stdout and stderr are (at least the names — we'll explain).
- **Required:** How to run your program from the command line and see its output.
- **Helpful but not required:** Familiarity with `grep` and `tail` for looking at text files.
- **Helpful but not required:** Some exposure to a server you've SSH'd into and watched logs scroll by.
- **Helpful but not required:** You've already read [Error Handling — Junior](../03-error-handling/junior.md) and you know the difference between an *error* and a *bug*. Logs and errors are siblings, not synonyms.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Log** | A record of "something happened" — typically timestamped, with a severity level. |
| **Log line** | One single record of one event. The atomic unit. |
| **Logger** | The object in your code you call to emit logs (e.g. `log.Info(...)`). Usually one per module. |
| **Log level** | The severity attached to a line: TRACE / DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR / FATAL. |
| **Appender / Handler** | The thing that actually writes the line *somewhere* (stdout, a file, a network socket). |
| **Formatter** | The thing that decides how the line *looks* (plain text, JSON, key=value). |
| **stdout / stderr** | Two of the three standard streams a process has (the third is stdin). On Unix, stdout is "normal output", stderr is "error / diagnostic output". |
| **Structured log** | A log line whose fields are *parseable* as key-value pairs (often JSON), not just free text. |
| **Unstructured log** | A log line that is just a string of English. Easy to read by eye, painful to query at scale. |
| **PII** | Personally Identifiable Information — names, emails, addresses, IDs. Generally don't log it; redact it. |
| **Secret** | Tokens, passwords, API keys. *Never* log these. Even once is a security incident. |
| **Audit log** | A special, append-only, often legally-required log of *who did what when*. Different concern from a debug log. |
| **Stack trace** | The list of function calls active when something went wrong. Often attached to ERROR-level lines. |
| **ISO 8601** | The international timestamp format: `2026-05-29T14:32:01Z`. The only format you should use. |
| **UTC** | Coordinated Universal Time — the timezone you should log in. Always. |
| **12-factor app** | A widely-cited set of rules for cloud-native apps; rule XI says "treat logs as event streams". |

## Core Concepts

### 1. A Log Line Is an Event Record

A log line says: *at this time, this thing happened, here is some context.* It is not the same as a print statement, even when it looks similar. A `print` is a side effect; a log line is **data**. It is meant to be searchable, filterable, aggregable, and (most importantly) understandable by someone who is not you.

A useful log line has at minimum: a **timestamp**, a **level**, a **source** (which logger/module emitted it), a **message**, and **values** of the relevant variables. We'll see this concretely in every example below.

### 2. `print` Is Not Logging

A `print` writes a string to stdout. That's it. No timestamp. No level. No source. No off-switch. Once shipped, every `print` in your code will fire every time the function runs, forever, until someone notices and deletes it. There is no way to say *"emit this only in production"* or *"emit this only when DEBUG is on"* without writing your own logging system. The standard-library logger already exists; use it.

`print` is fine for: quick scripts, one-off CLI tools, REPL exploration, debugging a function on your laptop. `print` is **not fine for**: anything that will run as a service, anything multi-user, anything that other people will operate, anything that will produce more than a handful of lines per second.

### 3. Logs vs Metrics vs Traces — One-Line Each

There are three "pillars" of observability. As a junior, you mostly write logs, but it's good to know what the other two are so you don't reach for the wrong tool:

- **Logs** — discrete events, one per "thing that happened." High cardinality, high detail, expensive to store. *"User 42 logged in at 14:32 from IP 1.2.3.4."*
- **Metrics** — numbers aggregated over time. Low cardinality, cheap, perfect for dashboards. *"100 logins per second."*
- **Traces** — the path of one request through many services. Great for *"why was this one request slow?"*. *"Request abc-123 spent 200ms in auth, 800ms in db."*

A junior reaches for logs by default; a senior knows when the right answer is a metric ("count failed logins") or a trace ("show me where this one request slowed down"). The deep treatment lives in `senior.md` and the `observability-stack` skill.

### 4. Why Programs Need Logs At All

There are four reasons a program writes logs, and almost everything you ever log is in service of one of these:

- **Operations** — does the system look healthy *right now*? Are requests succeeding? Is the queue draining?
- **Post-mortem debugging** — something broke last night at 3am. What were we doing right before? What did the upstream system reply?
- **Audit** — *who* did *what* and *when*? Legally required for finance, healthcare, anything with PII. Audit logs are immutable and treated as evidence.
- **Live debugging** — you've got a bug you can't reproduce locally; turn DEBUG on in staging and watch.

Notice all four are answered by the same data type — *records of events* — but with very different consumers and very different retention needs.

### 5. Levels Are Volume Knobs

The whole point of having TRACE / DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR / FATAL is so that you can turn the verbosity up or down **without changing the code**. The code says *"this is at DEBUG level"* once; the operator decides at deploy time whether DEBUG is on. The level is not a feature of the message — it's a feature of *who needs to see it*.

### 6. Operators Are the Audience

A log line written for yourself ("ok done") is useless to anyone else. A log line written for the future operator ("processed 142 orders for tenant=acme in 230ms") gives the person on call something to act on. The number-one mental shift when you start writing real logs is: **stop writing them for yourself, start writing them for the person who will read them at 3am.**

---

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---------|--------|
| **Log line** | A single entry in a ship's logbook — *"14:32, sighted lighthouse 3 miles NW, heading unchanged."* Timestamped, terse, factual. |
| **Log levels** | The volume knob on a radio. TRACE is "every whisper, every breath." FATAL is "the room is on fire and the broadcast is ending." |
| **`print` vs logger** | Sticky notes on the fridge vs a real notebook. Sticky notes are fine when there are three. They are a disaster when there are 30,000. |
| **stdout vs stderr** | Two voices: "here's the answer" (stdout) and "here's how it went" (stderr). Pipes are built so you can keep one and discard the other. |
| **Structured log** | A spreadsheet row vs a sentence. Both contain the same data, but only one can be sorted by column. |
| **PII in logs** | Writing customer credit card numbers in the public ship's log. The ship doesn't sink — but you're going to court. |
| **Logging everything** | Recording yourself breathing all day to find one cough. Technically thorough. Practically useless. |
| **No logs at all** | A pilot flying without a flight recorder. Fine until the crash, then you'll never know why. |
| **Mixed log formats** | Half the logbook in English, half in Morse code, some in Klingon. No tool can read all three. |

---

## Mental Models

**Mental model 1 — A log line is a tweet from a process.**

It is short, timestamped, and aimed at an audience. You don't write "I am about to make my fifteenth call to function `bar`." You write "processed payment id=42 amount=15.99 user=anon-7" — something *someone other than you* can read and act on. If you can't summarize the event in one line of less than 200 characters, you probably have the wrong granularity.

**Mental model 2 — Past, present, future.**

Every log line is answering one of three questions:
- *Past:* What happened just now? (INFO, ERROR)
- *Present:* What state am I in? (DEBUG, sometimes INFO at startup: "listening on port 8080")
- *Future:* What am I about to do? (DEBUG mostly, occasionally INFO at major lifecycle points)

If a log line answers none of these, delete it.

**Mental model 3 — Logs are write-once, read-rarely.**

Most log lines are never read. The ones that are read are read once, in panic, by a tired engineer at 3am. Optimize for *that* reader. They don't want cleverness, jokes, ASCII art, or your inside vocabulary. They want a timestamp, a level, a clear sentence, and the relevant values.

**Visualization — how a log line travels:**

```
   YOUR CODE                  STANDARD LIBRARY              THE WORLD
┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│ log.Info(    │         │  LOGGER             │         │             │
│   "user      │ ──────► │   level check  ───► │ ──────► │   stdout    │
│   logged in",│         │   formatter        │         │   stderr    │
│   "id", 42)  │         │   handler          │         │   file      │
└──────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘         │   network   │
                                                         └─────────────┘
```

You call a *method*; the logger decides whether to drop it (by level), formats it, and hands it to a *handler* that writes it somewhere. The crucial junior insight: **all three steps can be configured at deploy time without touching the code.**

## Log Levels — the Six Standard Ones

Almost every logging library — `logging` in Python, `log/slog` in Go, SLF4J in Java, `pino` and `winston` in Node — supports six standard severity levels. Memorize what each is *for*; the names alone don't tell you.

### TRACE

The finest possible level. *"I entered function `foo`, x was 7, I am about to return 8."* Off in production, off in staging, off most of the time even on your laptop. Enabled when you are stepping through a tricky bug and want a play-by-play. Most production codebases barely use TRACE at all.

### DEBUG

Diagnostic information. *"Fetched user record from cache (hit), cache_key=user:42."* Useful for developers chasing a bug, not for operators running the system. **Off by default in production**, on by default in development. You can crank it on in production temporarily to investigate something specific.

### INFO

Milestones. The system is healthy and this is something an operator would want to know happened. *"Server listening on :8080"*, *"Migration v17 applied successfully"*, *"Order 1234 processed for user 42."* **On by default in production**. The bulk of production logs are INFO.

A good test: would a human want to know this happened in production? If yes, INFO. If only a developer chasing a specific bug, DEBUG.

### WARN

Something is wrong but recoverable. *"Retry 1 of 3 after timeout to payment service"*, *"Cache miss exceeded threshold"*, *"Deprecated API endpoint called by client X"*. The system is still doing its job, but a human should probably notice this and consider acting.

WARN is also where "the world isn't shaped like we expected" lives — an unexpected but non-fatal config value, a row in the database with the wrong format. **Always on.**

### ERROR

A failure has happened and was handled, but the operation failed. *"Failed to send notification email to user 42: SMTP timeout"*, *"Could not write to audit log."* The request is over and someone got a bad answer; the system itself is still alive. **Always on, and usually alerted.**

If the request was *retried successfully*, log the original failure as WARN, not ERROR. ERROR is for things a user actually saw fail.

### FATAL

About to crash. *"Cannot connect to required database, shutting down."* The process is going down right after this line. Often FATAL implicitly calls `exit(1)` or terminates the program. Use rarely — most things you think are FATAL turn out to be ERROR plus a retry.

### The "what level should this be?" decision

A quick mental table:

| Situation | Level |
|-----------|-------|
| Function called and returned successfully | nothing, or TRACE |
| Cache hit | DEBUG |
| HTTP request received and answered 200 | INFO (or DEBUG if it's *every* request and noisy) |
| Server started, port bound, ready to serve | INFO |
| Config has a deprecated key | WARN |
| Transient downstream failure, retrying | WARN |
| Operation failed and was reported to user as failure | ERROR |
| Unhandled exception bubbled to top | ERROR (plus stack trace) |
| Cannot bind port, cannot reach essential db at startup | FATAL, then exit |

---

## Code Examples

We'll write the same trivial event — *"a user logged in"* — in all four languages, using each language's standard or near-standard library.

### Python — `logging` module, the standard library way

```python
import logging
import sys

# Configure once at the top of your program.
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(name)s: %(message)s",
    datefmt="%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ",
    stream=sys.stdout,
)

# One logger per module, named after the module.
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)


def login(user_id: int) -> None:
    log.info("user logged in user_id=%d", user_id)
    # Note: passing user_id as an argument, NOT building the string
    # with f"" — lets the logger skip formatting if the level is off.

    try:
        risky_thing()
    except Exception:
        # exc_info=True attaches the stack trace.
        log.error("failed to do risky thing for user_id=%d", user_id, exc_info=True)


def risky_thing() -> None:
    raise RuntimeError("downstream timeout")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    login(42)
```

Three things worth noticing:

1. `logging.getLogger(__name__)` — every module makes its own logger named after itself. This means an operator can later say *"turn DEBUG on for the `auth` module only"* and the logger hierarchy will do the right thing.
2. The format string uses **printf-style positional arguments** (`%d`, `%s`) — passed as additional args, *not* preformatted with f-strings. This lets the logger skip formatting when the level is filtered out.
3. `exc_info=True` attaches the current exception's stack trace.

### Go — `log/slog`, the modern standard library (Go 1.21+)

```go
package main

import (
	"log/slog"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Configure a logger that writes plain text to stdout.
	// Swap NewTextHandler for NewJSONHandler to get JSON output.
	logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelInfo,
	}))
	slog.SetDefault(logger)

	login(42)
}

func login(userID int) {
	// Structured logging: message + key/value pairs.
	slog.Info("user logged in", "user_id", userID)

	if err := riskyThing(); err != nil {
		slog.Error("failed to do risky thing",
			"user_id", userID,
			"err", err,
		)
	}
}

func riskyThing() error {
	return &timeoutError{msg: "downstream timeout"}
}

type timeoutError struct{ msg string }

func (e *timeoutError) Error() string { return e.msg }
```

For comparison, the **old** `log` package (still in the standard library) looks like:

```go
import "log"

log.Println("user logged in user_id=42")          // no level
log.Printf("user logged in user_id=%d", 42)       // no level
log.Fatalf("can't bind port: %v", err)            // FATAL: prints + os.Exit(1)
```

Use `log/slog` in new code. The old `log` package has no levels and no structure — fine for tiny utilities, wrong for a service.

### Java — SLF4J + Logback (the de facto standard)

SLF4J is the *interface*. Logback is one implementation (the most common); Log4j2 is another. You code against SLF4J; you swap implementations at deploy time without touching code.

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class AuthService {

    // One logger per class, named after the class. Convention.
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AuthService.class);

    public void login(long userId) {
        // {} is the placeholder; arguments are formatted lazily.
        log.info("user logged in user_id={}", userId);

        try {
            riskyThing();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Passing the exception last attaches the stack trace.
            log.error("failed to do risky thing for user_id={}", userId, e);
        }
    }

    private void riskyThing() {
        throw new RuntimeException("downstream timeout");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new AuthService().login(42);
    }
}
```

A default `logback.xml` on the classpath would look like:

```xml
<configuration>
  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%d{yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'} %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="INFO">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT"/>
  </root>
</configuration>
```

Notice: the code never names a file, never picks a format, never sets a level. All of that is in `logback.xml` — change it at deploy time, redeploy without recompiling.

### Node — `pino`, the minimal high-performance logger

`console.log` is the `print` of Node — fine for scripts, bad for services. The two most common real loggers are `winston` (feature-rich, slower) and `pino` (minimal, very fast, JSON by default).

```javascript
// npm install pino
const pino = require('pino');

const log = pino({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  // pino emits JSON by default; perfect for log pipelines.
});

function login(userId) {
  log.info({ user_id: userId }, 'user logged in');

  try {
    riskyThing();
  } catch (err) {
    log.error({ user_id: userId, err }, 'failed to do risky thing');
  }
}

function riskyThing() {
  throw new Error('downstream timeout');
}

login(42);
```

The convention in `pino`: the first argument is the **structured payload** (an object of key-value fields), the second is the **message string**. That order is the opposite of most loggers — pick it up early.

Output (pretty-printed via `pino-pretty` in development):

```
[2026-05-29T14:32:01.123Z] INFO: user logged in
    user_id: 42
```

In production the same code emits JSON, one line per event, ready to be shipped to a log aggregator without parsing.

## Pros & Cons of Common Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **`print` / `console.log`** | Zero config, works everywhere, easy to read in a terminal. | No level, no timestamp, no structure, no off-switch. Forever-on, forever-noisy. |
| **Standard-library text logger** (`logging`, old Go `log`, `java.util.logging`) | Always available, no dependency. Levels and timestamps for free. | Hard to make structured. Hard to send to multiple destinations. Default formats are often ugly. |
| **Structured logger** (`slog`, `pino`, `structlog`) | JSON output — machine-queryable, drops straight into log pipelines. Levels, fields, child loggers. | Slightly more setup. Harder to read in a terminal without a pretty-printer. |
| **High-perf logger** (`zap`, `zerolog`, Log4j2 async) | Sub-microsecond per log call. Used in hot paths. | More complex API. Often a separate field-building DSL. |
| **Log to file** | Survives crashes; rotation possible; works without a platform. | You now own rotation, retention, shipping. In a containerized world, you're swimming upstream. |
| **Log to stdout** | 12-factor; the platform handles everything (rotation, shipping, retention). | Doesn't survive if no one's collecting. Requires you to trust your orchestrator. |
| **Log to network (syslog/HTTP)** | Logs leave the machine immediately, survive crashes. | Adds a network dependency to your hot path. Buffering and failure modes are tricky. |

There is no universal "best." For a 2026-era cloud service: **stdout + structured logger** is the default. For a desktop app: a rotating file. For a CLI utility: maybe just stderr and call it done.

---

## Use Cases

Concrete places logging matters, and at what level:

- **A web service** — INFO on every request (route, status, latency); WARN on retries; ERROR on 5xx; DEBUG off in prod.
- **A batch job** — INFO at start ("started batch X, processing 10,000 rows"), INFO at end with counts ("done: 9,987 ok, 13 skipped"), ERROR per skipped row with the reason.
- **A long-running daemon** — INFO at startup (config summary, ports bound), INFO at lifecycle milestones (reload, shutdown), WARN on transient downstream issues, ERROR on requests that failed.
- **A CLI tool** — typically logs only on `-v` / `--verbose`; otherwise stdout is reserved for *output* and stderr for *errors and progress*.
- **A library** — should log very little, and only at DEBUG. Libraries that scream INFO are bad neighbors. Let the application decide.
- **An audit log** — separate logger, separate destination, immutable, never debug-level. Often *legally required* and lives next to (not inside) the regular log stream.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1 — One logger per module

Almost every language has the same idiom: get a logger named after the current module/class/package, and use it.

```python
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)   # Python
```

```go
// Go: usually use the default slog logger, or pass a *slog.Logger via context.
```

```java
private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(AuthService.class); // Java
```

Why: the logger *name* becomes a category. Operators can later filter by name (*"show me only `auth.*` warnings"*) without changing code.

### Pattern 2 — Configure at the edge, not in the middle

Logging is configured **once**, at program startup (or via a config file the framework reads at startup). Library code never configures logging; it just calls it.

```python
# main.py — top of the program
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, ...)

# everywhere_else.py — never configures, just uses
log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
log.info("...")
```

### Pattern 3 — Pass values as arguments, not as formatted strings

```python
# GOOD
log.info("user logged in user_id=%d", user_id)

# BAD — formats the string even when DEBUG is off
log.debug(f"complex object: {expensive_repr(obj)}")
```

The logger may skip the format step entirely if the level is filtered out. With f-strings or `+` concatenation, you pay the cost no matter what.

### Pattern 4 — Log at the boundary

A request enters your service at an HTTP handler. *That* layer is where you log the high-level "request started" / "request finished" lines. Internal helpers do not log their own progress — they let the boundary describe the whole event.

```go
func handleLogin(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    slog.Info("login attempt", "ip", r.RemoteAddr)

    user, err := authenticate(r)
    if err != nil {
        slog.Warn("login failed", "ip", r.RemoteAddr, "err", err)
        http.Error(w, "unauthorized", 401)
        return
    }

    slog.Info("login ok", "user_id", user.ID)
}
```

Don't have `authenticate` itself log "starting authenticate" / "ending authenticate". That noise is a junior reflex.

### Pattern 5 — Always attach the exception to ERROR

```java
log.error("failed to charge order id={}", orderId, e);   // 'e' is the exception
```

```python
log.error("failed to charge order id=%d", order_id, exc_info=True)
```

The error message tells *what happened*; the stack trace tells *where*. Both are valuable; ship them together.

## Clean Code

A junior who follows these will already write better logs than most production code:

1. **One logger per module, named.** No global "do everything" loggers.
2. **No `print` in committed code.** Use the logger. Always.
3. **No secrets, ever.** Tokens, passwords, API keys, session cookies. Treat them like radioactive material.
4. **No PII unless you've thought about it.** Email addresses, names, real IDs. Often legal questions, not just style.
5. **Past tense for facts, no jokes.** "User logged in", not "User logging in...!", not "lol yes good".
6. **Include the relevant ID(s).** Without a `user_id` or `order_id`, "operation failed" is unsearchable.
7. **Use the right level.** Not everything is INFO; not everything is ERROR. Read section 7 again.
8. **UTC and ISO 8601.** No `Mon May 29 02:32pm PDT`. Ever.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Log at the boundaries of operations** — request received, request answered; job started, job done. Not "I am calling helper X."
2. **Make every log line actionable or searchable.** If you can't grep for it later by some ID, why is it there?
3. **Prefer structured logs from day one.** Even if your output looks like text, format it as `key=value` so future-you can switch on JSON cleanly.
4. **Use the standard library by default.** Reach for `zap` / `pino` / Log4j2 when you've measured a real performance need.
5. **Set log levels via environment variable**, not in code. `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./myapp` is the right shape.
6. **Log to stdout in services**, let the platform handle the rest. (Unless it's a desktop app, then files.)
7. **Test that your logger is wired up.** A common bug: nothing logs because the level was set to WARN in a config you forgot about.
8. **Never log inside a tight loop without throttling.** A million log lines per second will crash the log pipeline before your code does.
9. **Don't log and re-throw.** Either log it *here* and handle it, or pass it up. Doing both gives you the same error five times.
10. **Review your logs before shipping.** Spin up the service locally, do the main flows, and *read what your code wrote.* You'll cringe. Fix it.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1 — Time zones in timestamps

A timestamp like `14:32:01` is *useless* without a time zone. Was that PDT? UTC? Server-local? When servers move between data centers (or when daylight saving changes), local timestamps make a chronological log impossible to reconstruct. **Always log in UTC, in ISO 8601 format.**

### Pitfall 2 — Logging in hot loops

```python
for row in rows:  # rows might be 10 million
    log.debug("processing row %s", row.id)
```

Even at DEBUG level, building the format string and routing through the logger is non-zero work. In a tight inner loop it can dominate. If you must log, log a *summary* once at the end ("processed 10M rows in 4.2s"), not a line per row.

### Pitfall 3 — Logging recursively / from inside a logger handler

Custom log handlers that themselves log can loop forever. Specialized infrastructure pitfall — just be aware.

### Pitfall 4 — Multi-line log records

`log.info("got payload:\n" + huge_json)` — the resulting log record spans 200 lines. Most log aggregators key on *one line per record* by default and will split it into 200 separate "events". Either log a single line (with `\n` escaped) or use a structured field.

### Pitfall 5 — UTF-8 in log output

If your code logs user-supplied strings, those strings might contain control characters, ANSI escapes, or terminal commands. A maliciously named file *can* embed `\x1b[2J` (clear screen) into your `tail -f` view. Sanitize before logging if you have user input.

### Pitfall 6 — Logging in `__del__` / destructors / shutdown hooks

By the time a destructor runs, the logger handler may already be closed. Logs at process shutdown sometimes silently disappear. Important shutdown messages should be flushed explicitly.

### Pitfall 7 — Forgetting to redact

```python
log.info("auth attempt with body %s", request.body)  # might contain password
```

Hardly anyone *intends* to log credentials. They show up because someone logged "the whole request" as a debugging shortcut. Make a habit of logging *specific fields*, not whole objects.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **`print` in production code.** Universal junior mistake. Use the logger.
2. **Logging passwords or tokens.** "user logged in with password=hunter2" — instant audit failure, possibly a security incident.
3. **`log.Info("ok")`** — meaningless. No timestamp helps you. No id, no context.
4. **`log.Info("entering function foo")` / `log.Info("exiting function foo")`** — noise, almost never useful. Use a profiler for that.
5. **Everything at INFO, or everything at ERROR.** Levels exist for a reason. Use them.
6. **Mixing formats in the same service.** Some lines plain text, some JSON, some pretty-printed. Log aggregators can only parse one consistently.
7. **Logging full stack traces of *expected* errors at ERROR.** A 404 from "user typed wrong URL" is not an ERROR, it's an INFO at most. Stack traces of *expected* failures swamp the real ones.
8. **Logging inside loops without throttling.** A burst of a million identical log lines tells you nothing and may DoS your own log pipeline.
9. **Forgetting time zones.** Local time in logs leads to nightmares the first time you debug across two regions.
10. **Hard-coding the log level.** `level=DEBUG` checked in to source means you can't turn it off without a redeploy.
11. **Catching an exception and only logging the message** (not the stack trace). The most-asked junior question in incident review: *"Where did that come from?"*
12. **Using stderr for "this is important" and stdout for "this is normal"** — fine convention, but only if you actually understand it. Many juniors blur the two.
13. **Building log strings with `+` or f-strings** even when the level is off. The cost is paid no matter what; use parameter substitution.
14. **`log.info("user object: " + str(user))`** — dumps an entire object, possibly including PII or secrets. Log specific fields.
15. **Logging in a library that other apps depend on.** Library logs at INFO are noise in someone else's service. Stay at DEBUG; let the app decide.

---

## Tricky Points

- **`print` and `log.info` look similar but are *worlds apart*** — only one can be turned off, routed, formatted, and parsed.
- **"Structured" doesn't mean "JSON"** — `key=value key2=value2` is also structured. The point is parseability, not the syntax.
- **The logger does the level check, *then* the format** — that's why passing args (not f-strings) matters: skipping the format saves real CPU when the level is off.
- **`log.Fatal` in Go calls `os.Exit(1)` immediately** — deferred functions do *not* run. Don't `log.Fatal` from inside a transaction.
- **In SLF4J, `log.info("hi {}", name)` formats lazily**; `log.info("hi " + name)` formats eagerly. Same line of text, very different cost.
- **`stdout` is line-buffered when attached to a terminal but *block*-buffered when piped to a file** — your logs may appear to "stop" after the last full block, until you flush. This catches a lot of juniors who think their program froze.
- **The logger hierarchy is a tree.** In Python, `auth.handlers.login` is a child of `auth.handlers`, which is a child of `auth`. Setting the level on `auth` affects all three. This is powerful and also surprising the first time.
- **Log timestamps are usually *wall clock*, not monotonic** — meaning NTP adjustments can make later lines have *earlier* timestamps. We'll see in `senior.md` why this matters for tracing.

---

## Test Yourself

Try these before peeking. Run real code; the answers are in the running.

1. Write a Python module `auth.py` that uses `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. From `main.py`, set the root logger level to INFO and verify your DEBUG line is *not* shown. Then change to DEBUG and verify it is.
2. Write a Go program using `slog` that logs three lines at INFO, WARN, and ERROR. Output JSON via `slog.NewJSONHandler`. Pipe through `jq` to pretty-print.
3. In Java with SLF4J + Logback, set the `auth` logger to DEBUG via `logback.xml` while keeping the root at INFO. Verify only `auth.*` logs at DEBUG.
4. In Node with `pino`, log a request object that contains a `password` field. Configure `pino`'s `redact` option to remove it before output.
5. Take any of the above and answer: *what level should "user typed wrong password" be?* WARN? INFO? ERROR? Defend your choice.
6. Make a Python program that logs from inside a tight loop a million times. Measure how much CPU time the logging takes. Now wrap the call in `if log.isEnabledFor(logging.DEBUG):` and measure again.
7. Identify three `print` statements in any project you have. For each, decide: should it be `log.debug`, `log.info`, or removed? Convert them and run.
8. Read your team's actual logs for one service for ten minutes. List every log line that you could *not* understand without reading the source code. Those are the lines whose authors failed at this skill.

## Tricky Questions

These are the kind of questions a senior asks a junior — not to trap you, but to see if you've thought past "logging means `print`":

1. *Why is `print("user logged in", user_id)` worse than `log.info("user logged in user_id=%d", user_id)`?* — Three reasons: no timestamp, no level (can't filter), and the format runs even if you didn't want output. The logger version is searchable and gateable.

2. *Should "user not found" be an ERROR?* — Almost never. If a real user typed a wrong username, that's a normal event — INFO at most, maybe WARN if it's part of an auth flow. Reserve ERROR for *system failures*, not user mistakes.

3. *Why ISO 8601 and UTC?* — Sortable, unambiguous, machine-parseable, and survives across time zones. `Tue May 29 14:32:01 PDT 2026` requires you to know whether PDT was in effect, what locale the parser uses, etc. `2026-05-29T21:32:01Z` does not.

4. *Is `log.debug(expensive_function())` ever OK?* — In Python it's almost-OK if you pass `expensive_function()` as an argument (`log.debug("got %s", expensive_function())`) — but the function still runs! The format is skipped, but Python evaluates the argument before the call. Wrap in `if log.isEnabledFor(...)` or use a lazy proxy.

5. *Why do most loggers default to stderr, not stdout?* — Because stdout is reserved for *program output* (the result of a CLI tool, the response of a server). stderr is the diagnostic channel. Pipes are designed so users can keep one and discard the other.

6. *What's wrong with `log.info("doing thing"); doThing(); log.info("done thing")`?* — Two log lines per operation doubles your log volume. Modern style: one log line at the end with the duration as a field. Pair with a metric if you need throughput.

7. *In Go's `slog`, why use `slog.Info(msg, "k", v)` over `fmt.Sprintf` into `slog.Info`?* — Because the key/value pairs are stored as *fields*, queryable by name in a log aggregator. The string-interpolated version is just text — unsearchable.

8. *When is `console.log` actually the right answer in Node?* — In a CLI tool's primary output (the thing the user is *supposed* to read). Not in a server, ever. There, use a real logger.

9. *Why does Java SLF4J use `{}` instead of `%s`?* — Performance: SLF4J doesn't format the string unless the level passes. The placeholder is a marker for lazy substitution, not a format specifier.

10. *If you redact a password in a log, did you log it?* — In memory, briefly, yes. Whether that counts depends on your threat model (and your auditor's). For high-stakes systems, don't *receive* the password into the log call at all.

### Quick reference — language defaults

| Language | Standard library | What to reach for |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Python | `logging` | `logging` by default; `structlog` if structured logs matter |
| Go | `log/slog` (1.21+) | `slog` by default; `zap` / `zerolog` for hot paths |
| Java | `java.util.logging` (don't) | SLF4J + Logback (or Log4j2) — universal |
| Node | `console.log` (don't, for services) | `pino` (fast, JSON); `winston` (feature-rich) |

### Quick reference — the "what level?" cheat

```text
program started / stopped               INFO
config loaded                           INFO  (or DEBUG if noisy)
request received                        INFO  (or DEBUG)
request answered with 2xx               INFO  (or DEBUG)
request answered with 4xx (user fault)  INFO or WARN
request answered with 5xx (we failed)   ERROR
retried, eventually succeeded           WARN
gave up after N retries                 ERROR
process about to crash, can't recover   FATAL
"calling function foo()"                NOPE — that's TRACE at best
```

## Summary

- A **log line** is a timestamped, leveled record of "something happened" — written for an *operator*, not for you.
- **`print` is not logging.** It has no timestamp, no level, no source, no off-switch. Use the standard-library logger.
- There are **six standard log levels** — TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL — and choosing the right one is the *point* of having them.
- Every language has a **standard library logger**: Python `logging`, Go `log/slog`, Java SLF4J + Logback, Node `pino` (or `winston`).
- In modern cloud services, the rule is: **log to stdout, let the platform handle the rest** (12-factor app, rule XI).
- Every log line should include at minimum a **timestamp (UTC, ISO 8601)**, a **level**, a **source**, a **message**, and **key=value context**.
- **Never log secrets** — passwords, tokens, API keys. **Never log PII** without thinking through the legal angle.
- **Logs are for the 3am reader.** Optimize for searchability and clarity, not cleverness.

You now have the basic vocabulary. In `middle.md` we go a level deeper: structured logging in production, log handlers, JSON output, context propagation across function calls, and the difference between a logger and a *log pipeline*.

## What You Can Build

With only the junior-level knowledge above, you can:

- **A CLI tool that uses `-v`/`-vv`/`-vvv` to control log level** — normal output to stdout, log lines to stderr, level rising with each `-v`.
- **A small web service** (Flask, FastAPI, `net/http`, Express) that logs every request at INFO with a request ID, a method, a path, a status code, and a duration. One line per request, structured.
- **A "log auditor" script** that reads your existing logs and reports: how many lines per level, how many distinct messages, which lines are most frequent, which lines contain something that *looks like* a token. Useful in real code review.
- **A retry wrapper that logs each retry** at WARN, succeeds quietly, and only logs ERROR on the final give-up. (Pairs nicely with the retry exercises in `../03-error-handling/junior.md`.)
- **A "structured print" replacement** — a function in your favorite language that wraps `print` to always include a timestamp, a level tag, and a module name. Then go through a small project and replace every `print` with it. You will feel the difference immediately.
- **A `logging.yaml`-driven Python service** — set the log level *and the output format* in a config file, change between text and JSON without touching code.

   INFO   │   "milestone"                          (on by default in prod)
   DEBUG  │   "diagnostic detail"                  (off in prod)
   TRACE  ▼   "every breath"                       (off everywhere usually)
