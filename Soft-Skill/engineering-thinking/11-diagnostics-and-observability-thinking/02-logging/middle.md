## Introduction

> Focus: **Structured logging** and **context propagation** — the two ideas that separate a "log statement" from a "log system."

At junior level, logs were sentences. You wrote `log.info("user logged in")` and that string ended up on stdout or in a file. That works on your laptop. It collapses the moment a thousand of those sentences per second flow through ten services, and the on-call engineer at 2 AM needs to find *one specific request*.

The middle-level shift is realising that a log line is not a message for a human — it is a **structured event for a machine**. The machine indexes it, filters it, joins it with metrics and traces, and only *then* shows the human a curated subset. The whole game changes once you accept that.

This page covers the two pivots that every developer needs to make on the way to senior: (1) **structured key-value logging instead of freeform strings**, and (2) **propagating per-request context** so that every line your code emits during a single request can be filtered out together. It also covers the libraries you should be fluent in (Go's `slog`, Java's SLF4J/Logback, Python's `structlog`, Node's `pino`), how to configure them, and the discipline of *what belongs at INFO vs WARN vs ERROR*.

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a middle:** Most "I can't debug production" stories are not about missing logs. They are about **logs you have but cannot query** — text smeared across millions of lines, no `request_id`, no `user_id`, no way to follow one chain of events through the noise.

---

## Prerequisites

What you should already know from `junior.md`:

- The standard log **levels** (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`) and roughly what each one means.
- How a stdlib logger works in at least one language (`log` in Go, `logging` in Python, `System.out` or `Logger` in Java, `console.log` in Node).
- The idea that logs go *somewhere* — stdout, stderr, a file, syslog — and that the program does not normally choose where in modern containerised deployments.
- Basic awareness that there is such a thing as a "log aggregator" (CloudWatch, Elasticsearch, Loki, Datadog) even if you have not configured one.

Helpful but not required:

- Some exposure to HTTP middleware (any language).
- Familiarity with JSON.
- Awareness of what a request_id or trace_id is.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Structured log** | A log entry that is a set of key-value fields (typically serialised as JSON), not a freeform sentence. |
| **NDJSON / JSONL** | "Newline-delimited JSON" — one JSON object per line. The de facto format for structured logs. |
| **Field** | A single key-value pair inside a structured log entry (e.g. `user_id=42`). |
| **Bound logger** | A logger instance carrying a set of fields that will be attached to every line it emits (e.g. `logger.With("request_id", id)`). |
| **MDC** | Mapped Diagnostic Context — Java/SLF4J's per-thread storage for fields like `request_id`, automatically attached to every log line on that thread. |
| **ContextVar** | Python's per-async-task/thread storage, used by `structlog.contextvars` for the same purpose as MDC. |
| **Appender / Handler / Sink** | The output destination for log entries — console, file, syslog, HTTP collector. Names differ by ecosystem. |
| **Async appender** | An appender that hands log entries to a background queue so the producing thread does not block on I/O. |
| **Sampler** | A component that emits only some fraction of qualifying log entries (e.g. 1 in 100 DEBUG lines). |
| **OpenTelemetry semantic conventions** | A standard vocabulary for field names — `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `db.system` — so logs from any service look comparable. |
| **Logger facade** | A library that defines a logging API but delegates to a concrete backend (SLF4J in Java, `slog.Handler` in Go). |
| **Log routing** | Sending different categories of logs to different destinations (errors to Sentry, access logs to S3, debug to stdout). |

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Structured Logging — the Central Middle-Level Idea

A **structured log entry** is not a sentence. It is a record — like a row in a database. The same event "user logged in" is:

```
[INFO] 2025-05-29 14:32:11 user 42 logged in from 10.0.1.5
```

as a freeform line, and

```json
{"ts":"2025-05-29T14:32:11Z","level":"info","event":"login","user_id":42,"ip":"10.0.1.5"}
```

as a structured line. The freeform one is for *you*, sitting in front of a terminal. The structured one is for *the query engine*, sitting in front of millions of lines.

The reason the structured form wins is the moment you need to ask a question like *"how many users from this IP block logged in last hour?"* The freeform line needs a regex. The structured line needs `event="login" AND ip ~ "10.0.1.*"`. The first breaks every time the message wording changes; the second does not.

> Once you accept that logs are events for a machine, the rest of this page falls into place automatically.

### 2. JSON Logs and NDJSON

The dominant serialisation for structured logs is **newline-delimited JSON** (also called JSONL or NDJSON):

```
{"ts":"...","level":"info","event":"login","user_id":42}
{"ts":"...","level":"info","event":"page_view","user_id":42,"path":"/home"}
{"ts":"...","level":"warn","event":"rate_limit_hit","ip":"10.0.1.5"}
```

Why NDJSON specifically?

- One event per line — `tail`, `grep`, log rotation, and log aggregators all work line-by-line.
- Each line is self-contained valid JSON — partial reads don't corrupt the rest.
- It is the input format every aggregator (Loki, Elasticsearch, CloudWatch, Datadog) consumes natively.

Other formats exist (logfmt's `key=value key=value`, Protobuf for ultra-high-volume systems) but JSON dominates because every language and every tool already speaks it.

### 3. Field Naming Conventions

Once you start writing structured logs, naming becomes a real concern. Three conventions matter:

| Choice | Example | Where you see it |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `snake_case` | `user_id`, `http_status` | Python, Go, most observability tools |
| `camelCase` | `userId`, `httpStatus` | Java, Node ecosystems by default |
| Dotted namespaces | `http.method`, `db.statement` | OpenTelemetry semantic conventions |

The single most important rule: **be consistent across the whole codebase.** If `user_id` and `userId` both appear, half your queries miss half the data.

The **OpenTelemetry semantic conventions** are becoming the de facto schema. They define field names like `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `http.route`, `db.system`, `db.statement`, `messaging.destination`, `exception.type`, `exception.stacktrace`. If you have no internal standard, adopt theirs — every modern tool understands them and you get analytics for free.

### 4. Context Propagation — Bound Fields

The second pivot is **per-request context**. Inside a single HTTP request, you might log from ten different functions across five files. Without context, the operator sees ten disconnected lines. With context, they all share a `request_id` and you can filter to *just* this request.

The mechanism is a **bound logger**: a logger instance that carries fields, attaching them automatically to every line.

```go
log := slog.Default().With("request_id", reqID, "user_id", userID)
log.Info("started")
log.Info("queried db")
log.Info("finished")
```

All three lines now have `request_id` and `user_id` fields. No need to remember to pass them every time. This is the foundation of operator productivity.

### 5. Per-Language Idioms for Context

Every language solves "where do I stash the bound fields?" differently:

- **Go:** Pass the bound logger through `context.Context` (or as an explicit argument). `slog.NewLogger().With("request_id", id)` returns a new logger; store it in context with a typed key, retrieve it in handlers.
- **Python:** Two routes. The `logging` stdlib supports `extra={"request_id": id}` per call (verbose). `structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars(request_id=id)` binds for the rest of the async task, picked up automatically by every log call. `LoggerAdapter` is the older middle-ground.
- **Java:** `MDC.put("requestId", id)` writes to a per-thread `ThreadLocal` map. SLF4J's pattern layout interpolates `%X{requestId}` from it. You must `MDC.clear()` (or use a filter) when the request ends, otherwise the next request on the same thread inherits the field.

### 6. Why MDC Cleanup Is the #1 Java Logging Bug

The MDC is a `ThreadLocal`. Tomcat reuses threads. If your filter does `MDC.put("requestId", id)` but never clears, the *next* request handled by the same thread sees the old request_id. Your logs lie. Operators chase ghosts.

Always pair `MDC.put` with a `try { ... } finally { MDC.clear(); }`. Better — use Spring's `MDCInsertingServletFilter` or a similar utility that does this for you.

The cross-thread version is worse. If you `ExecutorService.submit(task)`, the MDC of the calling thread does *not* propagate to the worker thread. You need to capture it (`Map<String, String> ctx = MDC.getCopyOfContextMap()`) and restore it inside the task. Frameworks like Project Reactor provide context propagation; Spring Boot's `TaskDecorator` is the standard hook.

### 7. Configuring Loggers in Real Apps

A production logger has at least three configurables:

| Config | Typical mechanism |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Global level** | Env var `LOG_LEVEL=info` (12-Factor) or YAML/JSON file |
| **Per-package level** | `logger.com.example.payments=DEBUG`, `logger.org.hibernate=WARN` |
| **Format / appenders** | Structured JSON in prod, pretty colored text in dev |

The "global level" model is too coarse for production — you want INFO globally but DEBUG only on the misbehaving package without flooding the disk. Every grown-up logging library (Logback, slog with custom handlers, `logging.dictConfig`) supports per-package levels.

### 8. Hot-Reload of Log Level

You should not have to redeploy to change the log level. The pattern is an HTTP endpoint that mutates the running logger's level:

- **Spring Boot:** Actuator's `/actuator/loggers/{logger}` endpoint accepts a `POST` with `{"configuredLevel": "DEBUG"}`.
- **Go:** Expose an HTTP handler that calls `levelVar.Set(slog.LevelDebug)` where `levelVar` is a `slog.LevelVar` you constructed your handler with.
- **Python:** Wire a small admin endpoint that calls `logging.getLogger("foo").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`.

This is a tiny feature with enormous operational value. Every service you write past a certain scale should have it.

### 9. Log Routing — Multiple Appenders

The same log entry may need to go several places at once:

| Sink | What for |
|------|----------|
| **stdout** | Local dev, container log capture |
| **File (rotated)** | Self-hosted servers, audit retention |
| **Syslog** | OS-integrated log shipping |
| **Sentry / Bugsnag** | ERROR-level only, with stack traces |
| **HTTP collector** | Push to Loki / Elasticsearch / Datadog |

The library lets you wire several "appenders" (Logback) / "handlers" (Python, Go) / "sinks" / "transports" (Pino, Winston) to the same logger. Each can have its own level filter (errors-only to Sentry, everything to stdout).

### 10. Async Appenders and the Blocking Pitfall

If you log to a remote sink synchronously, every log call is now a network round-trip. A 50ms-slow log call called 100 times per request = +5 seconds of request latency. Worse, if the sink goes down, your service goes down.

The fix is **async appenders**: log calls enqueue to an in-memory bounded queue; a background goroutine/thread/task drains the queue to the sink.

Three policies when the queue fills:
- **Block** the producer (safe but cascades the outage into your app).
- **Drop** new entries (visible holes in logs but app stays alive).
- **Buffer to disk** (most robust; needs disk-space management).

Default in Logback's `AsyncAppender` is *drop on full queue*. Default in Pino's transports is *buffer to disk*. You should know which your library does and override it deliberately for production.

### 11. Error Logging Discipline

When you log an error, include all four of these:

1. **The error chain** — not just `err.Error()` or `e.getMessage()` but the full wrapped stack. Go: `slog.Error("failed", "err", err)` and configure the handler to print the chain. Java: `logger.error("failed", e)` — always pass `e` as a separate arg.
2. **The trace_id / request_id** — bound onto the logger, automatic if you set up context propagation.
3. **What you were trying to do** — `"failed to charge customer"` is useful, `"error"` is not.
4. **The identifying inputs** — `customer_id=42 order_id=99`. Not the whole object (PII risk) but the IDs needed to investigate.

The classic anti-pattern is **log-AND-throw**: every layer catches, logs, and rethrows. Now one error appears five times in the logs at five different levels, and the operator can't tell if it's one failure or five. **Log once at the boundary** (the HTTP handler, the message consumer, the top-level job) and let the lower layers `return err` / `throw e` cleanly.

### 12. Performance — The String Formatting Trap

```go
log.Debug("got " + getExpensiveThing())
```

Even when DEBUG is off, `getExpensiveThing()` runs. The argument is evaluated before the function call. The level check happens too late.

Three escape hatches:

- **Format-string APIs:** SLF4J's `log.debug("got {}", value)` — `value` is formatted only if DEBUG is enabled. But `value` itself must already be cheap; if it's a method call, it ran.
- **Supplier-based APIs:** Log4j 2 / SLF4J 2.x's `log.atDebug().log("got {}", () -> expensive())`. The lambda runs only on enabled level.
- **Explicit level check:** `if log.IsDebugEnabled() { ... }` around the expensive call. Verbose but safe.
- **Go `slog.LogAttrs`:** lazy attribute formatting; `slog.Any("k", expensiveValue)` still evaluates `expensiveValue`, but `slog.Attr` itself is cheap and `LogAttrs` does the level check first.

Sampling — emitting only every Nth line — is the next layer of defence. We touch it here; deep dive in `senior.md`.

### 13. What Belongs at Each Level

The discipline:

| Level | What it means | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **DEBUG** | Detail useful only when actively diagnosing | Request body summaries, decision branches, cache hit/miss |
| **INFO** | Milestones — "what is happening" | Request started, request finished, job started, job done |
| **WARN** | Unusual but handled — operator may want to know | Retry happened, fallback used, deprecated path hit, slow query |
| **ERROR** | I failed; the caller sees a failure | Outbound call failed after retries, DB write rejected |
| **FATAL** | Process cannot continue; shutting down | Cannot bind port, cannot load config |

The biggest mistakes here:

- Logging *bugs* at ERROR. A bug is not an error — it's a stack trace, and it should go to a crash reporter (Sentry), not just spam the ERROR log.
- Logging *all* exceptions at ERROR even when the calling layer will retry. The retry succeeded; that's a WARN at most.
- INFO inside a tight loop. One INFO per 10,000 iterations is fine; one per iteration drowns the log.

### 14. Per-Request vs Background Logs

Two distinct shapes of log stream coexist in most services:

**Per-request logs** — one "access log" line per HTTP request, with method, path, status, duration, request_id, user_id. This is what nginx, Caddy, and AWS ALB emit by default. Inside your app, an HTTP middleware emits it after the response is sent.

**Background job logs** — a job starts, makes progress, finishes. The shape is "this job ran, it processed N items, took T seconds, and the result was X." A different aggregation entirely.

A mature app emits both as structured events, not freeform messages.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---------|---------|
| Freeform log line | A handwritten note on a sticky paper |
| Structured log entry | A row in an Excel spreadsheet |
| `request_id` field | The order number on every receipt for one shopping trip |
| Bound logger | A waiter who already knows your table number — every order they take is tagged |
| MDC | A name badge clipped to the worker's apron — every form they fill out has it stamped |
| Async appender | A drop box for outgoing mail — you leave it and walk away; someone else delivers |
| Log routing | Postal sorting — letters go to addresses, parcels to depots, parcels marked URGENT to express |
| Level filter | A bouncer at a club — only people above this importance get in |
| Sampling | A pollster — surveys 1 in 1000 voters, not all of them |

---

## Mental Models

### Logs Are an Append-Only Database

Stop thinking of `log.info` as a `println`. Think of it as `INSERT INTO events`. The fields you pass are columns. The aggregator is the database. Your queries are `WHERE level='error' AND user_id=42`. Once that model is in your head, every other design decision becomes obvious — yes you'd index `user_id`, yes you'd want types, yes you'd want a schema.

### Context Flows With the Request, Not the Function

A `request_id` is not data the function operates on — it's metadata the function inherits. The right place for it is "wherever this request is being processed right now," which is context (`context.Context` in Go, `MDC` in Java, `contextvars` in Python). Passing it through every function signature pollutes them.

### Log Levels Are Audience, Not Importance

INFO is not "less important than" ERROR — they're for different audiences. INFO is for the operator who wants to see the heartbeat of the system. ERROR is for the on-call who got paged. DEBUG is for the developer who *opted in*. When you set the level, you're picking the audience, not the priority.

## Logging Libraries You Should Know

### Go

| Library | Status | Strengths | Use when |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| `log/slog` | Stdlib since Go 1.21 | Built-in, structured by default, pluggable handlers | New code, default choice |
| `zap` (Uber) | Mature, fast | Lowest allocation, ergonomic field constructors | Hot path, ultra-high throughput |
| `zerolog` | Mature, fast | Zero allocation, chained-builder API | Hot path, JSON-only deployments |
| `logrus` | Legacy | First popular structured logger | Existing codebases only — do not pick for new code |

For new Go services in 2025, `slog` is the answer unless you have a measured reason. It's good enough, it's stdlib, and the rest of the ecosystem is converging on it.

### Java

| Library | Status | Use when |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **SLF4J** | The facade | Always — code to SLF4J, swap backends behind it |
| **Logback** | Default backend in Spring Boot | Default choice; battle-tested |
| **Log4j 2** | Alternative backend | Specific perf workloads; async logger is faster than Logback's |

Always log through SLF4J's `Logger`, never directly to a concrete backend. The CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) lesson is *not* "Log4j 2 is bad" — it's "centralised logging frameworks are critical infrastructure and need security review like any other dependency." If you used SLF4J you could swap backends in 24 hours; if you imported `org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger` directly everywhere, you spent a week.

### Python

| Library | Style | Use when |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `logging` (stdlib) | Classic, hierarchical, handler-based | Anywhere — universal |
| `structlog` | "Bind keys to logger" model | Structured logging is a first-class need |
| `loguru` | Single object, decorators, pretty | Scripts and small apps, beautiful tracebacks |

The `structlog` model — *the logger carries bound fields* — is the same mental model as Go's `slog.With`, Java's MDC, Node's `pino.child`. Learn it once.

### Node

| Library | Style | Use when |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `pino` | Fast, JSON-by-default, transports for sinks | Production services — default choice |
| `winston` | Flexible, slower, more configurable | Legacy or when you need a niche transport |

Pino won because it's *fast enough that you don't think about it* and JSON-by-default matches modern aggregator expectations. The "pretty" output is a separate `pino-pretty` process you pipe into during dev.

---

## Code Examples

### Go: `slog` JSON Handler with Bound `request_id` in HTTP Middleware

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log/slog"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/google/uuid"
)

type ctxKey string

const loggerKey ctxKey = "logger"

// LoggerFromContext returns the request-bound logger, or the default.
func LoggerFromContext(ctx context.Context) *slog.Logger {
	if l, ok := ctx.Value(loggerKey).(*slog.Logger); ok {
		return l
	}
	return slog.Default()
}

// RequestLogger middleware binds request_id + method + path onto a logger
// and stuffs it into the request context.
func RequestLogger(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		reqID := r.Header.Get("X-Request-Id")
		if reqID == "" {
			reqID = uuid.NewString()
		}
		log := slog.Default().With(
			"request_id", reqID,
			"http.method", r.Method,
			"http.route", r.URL.Path,
		)
		start := time.Now()
		log.Info("request.started")

		ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), loggerKey, log)
		next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))

		log.Info("request.finished", "duration_ms", time.Since(start).Milliseconds())
	})
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	log := LoggerFromContext(r.Context())
	log.Info("handling thing", "user_id", 42)
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}

func main() {
	slog.SetDefault(slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelInfo,
	})))
	http.Handle("/", RequestLogger(http.HandlerFunc(handler)))
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Run this and `curl -H "X-Request-Id: abc" http://localhost:8080/`. Every line emitted during the request carries `request_id=abc`.

### Python: `structlog` with `bind_contextvars` Showing Per-Request Context

```python
import logging
import sys
import uuid
from contextvars import copy_context

import structlog
from structlog.contextvars import bind_contextvars, clear_contextvars

# Configure structlog to emit JSON and pick up contextvars.
structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.contextvars.merge_contextvars,
        structlog.processors.add_log_level,
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
    ],
    wrapper_class=structlog.make_filtering_bound_logger(logging.INFO),
)

log = structlog.get_logger()


def charge_customer(customer_id: int, amount: int) -> None:
    log.info("charge.attempt", customer_id=customer_id, amount=amount)
    # ...payment provider call...
    log.info("charge.success", customer_id=customer_id)


def handle_request(user_id: int) -> None:
    clear_contextvars()
    bind_contextvars(
        request_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        user_id=user_id,
    )
    log.info("request.started")
    charge_customer(customer_id=user_id, amount=1000)
    log.info("request.finished")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    handle_request(user_id=42)
    handle_request(user_id=99)
```

Notice that `charge_customer` does not take `request_id` or `user_id` as arguments — they are picked up from `contextvars` and merged into every log entry automatically. In an `asyncio` web framework you bind once at the start of the request handler and every nested `await` inherits.

### Java: SLF4J with MDC Inside a Spring Filter

```java
package com.example.logging;

import jakarta.servlet.Filter;
import jakarta.servlet.FilterChain;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletException;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.slf4j.MDC;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.UUID;

@Component
public class RequestIdFilter implements Filter {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(RequestIdFilter.class);
    private static final String HEADER = "X-Request-Id";
    private static final String MDC_KEY = "requestId";

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {
        HttpServletRequest http = (HttpServletRequest) req;
        String reqId = http.getHeader(HEADER);
        if (reqId == null || reqId.isBlank()) {
            reqId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        }
        MDC.put(MDC_KEY, reqId);
        MDC.put("httpMethod", http.getMethod());
        MDC.put("httpRoute", http.getRequestURI());

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            log.info("request.started");
            chain.doFilter(req, res);
            log.info("request.finished durationMs={}", System.currentTimeMillis() - start);
        } finally {
            MDC.clear();   // critical — thread will be reused
        }
    }
}
```

With Logback's pattern `%d %-5level [%X{requestId}] %logger - %msg%n`, every line from any class running in this thread is automatically tagged. The `finally { MDC.clear(); }` is the most important line — forget it, and the next request inherits the field.

### Async Log Appender — Producer/Consumer Queue

A minimal async appender for educational purposes. Real ones (Logback's `AsyncAppender`, Pino's `transport`) are more complex but the skeleton is the same.

```go
package asynclog

import (
	"context"
	"log/slog"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// AsyncHandler wraps any slog.Handler and offloads writes to a goroutine.
type AsyncHandler struct {
	inner    slog.Handler
	queue    chan slog.Record
	wg       sync.WaitGroup
	dropped  int64
	dropLock sync.Mutex
}

func NewAsyncHandler(inner slog.Handler, bufferSize int) *AsyncHandler {
	h := &AsyncHandler{
		inner: inner,
		queue: make(chan slog.Record, bufferSize),
	}
	h.wg.Add(1)
	go h.drain()
	return h
}

func (h *AsyncHandler) Enabled(ctx context.Context, l slog.Level) bool {
	return h.inner.Enabled(ctx, l)
}

func (h *AsyncHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) error {
	select {
	case h.queue <- r:
		return nil
	default:
		// Queue full — drop and count. Tradeoff: visible holes but app stays up.
		h.dropLock.Lock()
		h.dropped++
		h.dropLock.Unlock()
		return nil

```

The producer (your `log.Info(...)` call) returns immediately after a channel send. The consumer goroutine drains and writes. The `default` branch on a full channel implements the **drop policy**. Swap to a blocking send for **block policy**. Replace with a disk-backed queue for **buffer policy**.

## Pros & Cons of Structured Logging

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Queryable — you can filter by field instead of grepping | Slightly more verbose to write than `log.info("msg")` |
| Aggregator-friendly — every tool indexes JSON | Harder to eyeball during local dev (mitigated with pretty-printers) |
| Field schema can evolve without breaking old logs | Field names must be governed across teams or chaos follows |
| Trace correlation is trivial once `trace_id` is a field | JSON is bigger on disk than freeform (mitigated by compression) |
| Works hand-in-hand with metrics and traces | Some teams over-bind fields and produce 50-key log entries |

---

## Use Cases

- **Finding all logs for one user's failed checkout.** `user_id=42 event=checkout level>=warn` — five seconds in Kibana.
- **Diagnosing a slow request after the fact.** Filter by `request_id`, see every step's duration field.
- **Audit logs.** `event=auth.login` plus `user_id`, `ip`, `mfa_used` — structured fields make compliance reports trivial.
- **Comparing two deploys.** Filter by `service.version=...` to see if errors started after the new release.
- **Per-customer support investigations.** "Show me everything for customer 12345 in the last hour" — only structured logs make this fast.
- **Triggering alerts on log patterns.** `event=payment.failed AND error_code=card_declined` count > N per minute — pages on-call.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern: Logger-from-context Helper

Every codebase that uses bound loggers needs a one-line helper to fetch the logger from a context object:

```go
func L(ctx context.Context) *slog.Logger {
    if l, ok := ctx.Value(loggerKey).(*slog.Logger); ok { return l }
    return slog.Default()
}
// usage:
L(ctx).Info("did the thing", "n", count)
```

The single-letter name (`L`, `logger`) is intentional — you'll type it everywhere.

### Pattern: Structured Field Builder for Errors

A helper that always logs an error with the standard fields:

```python
def log_error(log, action: str, err: Exception, **fields):
    log.error(
        f"{action}.failed",
        error_type=type(err).__name__,
        error_message=str(err),
        **fields,
    )

log_error(log, "charge", err, customer_id=42, amount=1000)
```

Removes the "did you remember to include the customer_id?" question entirely.

### Pattern: HTTP Access-Log Middleware

One INFO per request, after the response is sent, with method/path/status/duration. Every framework should have this; if not, write it once and reuse.

### Pattern: Per-package Level Override at Startup

```go
levelVar := new(slog.LevelVar)
levelVar.Set(slog.LevelInfo)
// Endpoint to mutate at runtime:
http.HandleFunc("/admin/loglevel", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    switch r.URL.Query().Get("level") {
    case "debug": levelVar.Set(slog.LevelDebug)
    case "info":  levelVar.Set(slog.LevelInfo)
    case "warn":  levelVar.Set(slog.LevelWarn)
    }
})
```

### Pattern: Lazy Logging with Suppliers

```java
log.atDebug()
   .addArgument(() -> serializeExpensiveDiagnostic(order))
   .log("order state: {}");
```

`serializeExpensiveDiagnostic` runs only if DEBUG is enabled.

---

## Clean Code

- One logger **per class / per package**, not per call. Created once, reused.
- Log **events**, not sentences. `event="login.success"` not `"User successfully logged in"`.
- Field names are **stable contracts** — changing `user_id` to `userId` breaks every dashboard.
- Never log secrets (passwords, tokens, full PANs, session cookies). Mask or omit.
- Never log entire request/response bodies at INFO — summaries only.
- Error logs always include the error chain.

---

## Best Practices

- **Pick one format and one schema, ban the rest.** Half-JSON, half-text codebases are a debugging hellscape.
- **Bind `request_id` (and `trace_id` if you have tracing) at the request boundary.** Once. The rest of the code never needs to think about it.
- **Configure level via env var, with a hot-reload endpoint.** No redeploys to debug.
- **Errors go through one boundary log.** Internal layers `return err` / `throw`. The boundary logs once.
- **Sample noisy DEBUG.** If a tight loop must DEBUG, sample 1-in-N.
- **Async-write to remote sinks** with a sane drop policy and metrics on `logs_dropped_total`.
- **Standardise field names** — adopt OpenTelemetry semantic conventions if you have no internal standard.
- **Log access lines as structured events**, not via `printf` to stdout.
- **Test your log output.** Snapshot tests on the JSON shape catch field-renaming regressions.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

| Pitfall | What happens | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| MDC not cleared between requests | Wrong `request_id` on later requests | `try/finally MDC.clear()` or a filter |
| MDC not propagated to worker thread | Background jobs lose context | Capture map, restore inside task |
| Sync log to remote sink | One slow sink = slow service | Async appender with drop policy |
| Logging a huge object | OOM or log truncation | Log IDs only; keep the object out |
| Field collision | Two callers use `user` differently — one a string, one an object | Type-check at handler level; lint field names |
| Logger created per-call | High alloc, GC pressure | One per class/package |
| Unicode in a log message handled by a non-UTF8 backend | Mangled chars in aggregator | Force UTF-8 in handler config |
| Logging INFO in a tight loop | Aggregator costs explode | Move to DEBUG; sample if needed |
| `printStackTrace()` instead of `log.error("...", e)` | Goes to stderr unstructured | Always log exceptions through the logger |
| Forgetting to log when an outbound HTTP call fails | "Why is this slow?" with no clue | Wrap every external call with timing + error log |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mixing JSON and text logs in one codebase.** The aggregator can parse one or the other — not both. Pick one at the architecture-decision level.
2. **MDC bleed between requests in a thread pool.** Always `MDC.clear()` in a `finally`.
3. **Creating a `Logger` inside every function** instead of one per class/package. Wastes allocations and obscures the "who is logging" info.
4. **`printStackTrace()` in Java code.** Goes to stderr without level or context. Use `logger.error("op failed", e)`.
5. **`log.Debug("got " + computeExpensive())`.** Argument always evaluates. Use format-string or lazy-supplier form.
6. **`logger.error()` on every layer of the stack.** Caller logs, callee logs, both log — one error appears five times. Log once at the boundary.
7. **Logging INFO inside a tight loop.** A million-iteration loop emitting INFO = a million log lines = aggregator bill spike.
8. **Forgetting to log outbound HTTP/DB call failures.** Always wrap with start/finish/duration/error.
9. **Logging secrets** — passwords, tokens, raw card numbers. One screenshot in a Slack channel and you have a breach.
10. **Inconsistent field names** (`user_id` here, `userId` there, `uid` over there). Query writers cry.
11. **Using `log.Fatal` (Go) deep inside a handler.** It calls `os.Exit(1)` — your whole server dies because one request had a bad day.
12. **No request_id at all.** Filtering by user_id catches multiple concurrent requests; you can't tell which line belongs to which.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Bound loggers are immutable.** `logger.With(...)` returns a *new* logger. `logger.With("a", 1)` then logging on the original logger does not include `a=1`. Easy to miss.
- **`slog`'s `WithAttrs` is called per-handler-chain, not per-record.** Wrapping handlers (async, filtering, multi-output) must implement `WithAttrs` carefully or bound fields disappear.
- **Python's `logging` is thread-safe but the default handlers acquire a lock.** Heavy log volume across many threads can serialise on that lock — a real concern at 100k events/sec.
- **`logrus.WithField` in Go returns an `*Entry`, not a `*Logger`.** Two parallel APIs; some users confuse them.
- **Pino's `child` logger is cheap** because it pre-serialises bindings — but mutating bound objects after creating the child gives stale values.
- **Logback's `AsyncAppender` drops *INFO and below* when 80% full** by default, keeping WARN+ flowing. Few people know that knob exists.
- **MDC propagation across `CompletableFuture`** requires either a decorator or libraries like `micrometer-context-propagation`. Plain `runAsync(...)` loses it.
- **Structured logs sent to journald** (`systemd-journald`) get re-parsed and indexed — but the journal's own metadata overlays your fields. Watch for collisions on `MESSAGE`, `PRIORITY`.
- **`%s` formatting in Python `logging.info("user %s", id)`** is lazy — only formats if the level is enabled. `f"user {id}"` is not — always evaluates.
- **Zerolog and Zap pre-allocate** field arrays based on level; flipping levels at runtime can shake out hidden alloc bugs.

## Test Yourself

1. You have a Spring Boot service. `MDC.put("requestId", id)` is called in a filter but operators say `requestId` is sometimes wrong. What two failure modes should you check first?
2. You write `log.Debug("got " + lookupFromDB(id))` in Go and DEBUG is off. What is the cost? How do you fix it?
3. A teammate says "we log the same error at every layer so we know where it came from." Why is this an anti-pattern? What replaces it?
4. You're choosing between `pino` and `winston` for a new Node service. State two reasons to prefer `pino`.
5. You want to change one package's log level to DEBUG without redeploying. Describe how you'd add this in (a) Spring Boot and (b) a Go service using `slog`.
6. Your async log appender is dropping 5% of log entries during peak. Two non-trivial fixes that don't increase memory unbounded?
7. You see a log line `{"msg":"failed","user":"alice","user":42}`. Two distinct things went wrong. What are they?
8. A `request_id` from a thread-pool worker shows up in an unrelated log line in another thread. Where do you look?

---

## Tricky Questions

**Q1. Why does SLF4J prefer `log.info("user {} logged in", userId)` over `log.info("user " + userId + " logged in")`?**

A: Two reasons. (1) **Lazy evaluation** — if INFO is disabled the formatting never happens, including any `toString()` of `userId`. (2) **No string concatenation cost** on the hot path. Both add up at scale.

**Q2. Should I create a `Logger` field per class or share one global logger?**

A: Per class. The class name becomes the logger name, which lets you set per-package levels (`logger.com.example.payments=DEBUG`). One per class also makes the source of each line obvious.

**Q3. JSON vs logfmt — which to pick?**

A: JSON unless you have a specific reason. Every aggregator parses it natively. Logfmt is human-friendlier in raw form but lacks nested objects and is less universally supported.

**Q4. Why is `printStackTrace()` considered an anti-pattern?**

A: It writes to stderr without going through the logger. No level filter, no structured fields, no MDC, no async appender, no remote sink. The same crash is visible to your `tail -f` but invisible in Kibana.

**Q5. How does `request_id` differ from `trace_id`?**

A: `request_id` is the ID your *service* assigns to one inbound request. `trace_id` is the distributed-tracing ID that spans multiple services for the same operation. Often a service generates `request_id` if no `trace_id` is present in headers; if both exist, log both.

**Q6. Why does Logback drop INFO entries first under load?**

A: Because the engineer who designed `AsyncAppender` decided WARN+ is more valuable than INFO and below. If your queue is full you almost certainly have a deeper problem; preserving the diagnostic logs (WARN/ERROR) buys you the chance to figure it out.

**Q7. How do you propagate MDC across `ExecutorService.submit`?**

A: Capture `Map<String,String> ctx = MDC.getCopyOfContextMap()` before submission; inside the task, `MDC.setContextMap(ctx)` at the top and `MDC.clear()` at the bottom. Or use a `TaskDecorator` (Spring) / a `Runnable` wrapper utility that does this for you.

**Q8. What is "log routing" and why might errors go to a different sink than INFO?**

A: Routing = sending different categories of entries to different sinks. ERROR usually goes to Sentry/Bugsnag (with stack traces, alerts, grouping). INFO goes to a cheap aggregator (Loki, CloudWatch). Routing keeps the expensive error tooling focused and the bulk INFO cost low.

## Summary

- **Logs are events for machines**, not sentences for humans. Structured key-value JSON is the language.
- **Per-request context** (`request_id`, `user_id`, `trace_id`) is bound once at the request boundary and inherited by every log line during that request. Go uses `context.Context`, Java uses `MDC`, Python uses `contextvars`, Node uses child loggers.
- **One logging library per language, used consistently.** `slog` in Go, SLF4J+Logback in Java, `structlog` in Python, `pino` in Node.
- **Level discipline:** INFO is heartbeats, WARN is handled-but-unusual, ERROR is "we failed," DEBUG is opt-in detail. Bugs belong in a crash reporter, not the ERROR log.
- **Performance:** avoid eager string formatting inside disabled-level calls; async-appender remote sinks; sample noisy DEBUG.
- **Error logs need the error chain + context + identifying IDs**, logged *once* at the boundary, not at every layer.
- **Configure via env, hot-reload via HTTP**, route different categories to different sinks.
- The mistakes that hurt most: MDC bleed, log-and-throw, JSON/text mixing, secrets in logs, logger-per-call.

---

## What You Can Build

- **A request-id-aware HTTP server in your language of choice** with bound logger middleware and an access-log line per request.
- **A small log-querying CLI** that reads NDJSON from stdin and supports `--field key=value` filters — gives you intuition for what aggregators do.
- **An admin endpoint** for changing log level at runtime in any of your existing services.
- **An async appender** with metrics (`logs_enqueued_total`, `logs_dropped_total`, `queue_size`).
- **A log scrubber** middleware that masks fields named like `password`, `token`, `secret`, `card_number` before they reach the handler.
- **A small "request replay" tool** that, given a `request_id`, fetches every log line from your aggregator and prints them in chronological order.
- **A logging linter** that flags `printStackTrace()`, `log.debug("..." + foo)`, and creates-logger-per-call patterns in your codebase.

   Queue policies on FULL:
     [ block ]  producer waits  → cascades latency into your app
     [ drop  ]  silently lose   → app stays up, logs have holes
     [ disk  ]  spill to file   → most robust, needs space mgmt
```

### Log Level Decision Flow

```text
   Something happened. What level?
              │
              ▼
   Was it a bug (defect in MY code)?
       │ yes
       ▼
   ┌───────────────────────────┐
   │  Send to crash reporter   │
   │  (Sentry/Bugsnag).        │
   │  ERROR is optional extra. │
   └───────────────────────────┘

      No, expected world failure
              │
              ▼
   Did we handle it (retry / fallback)?
       │ yes
       ▼
   ┌───────────────┐
   │     WARN      │
   └───────────────┘

      No - caller sees failure
              │
              ▼
   ┌───────────────┐
   │    ERROR      │
   └───────────────┘

      Routine milestone (start / finish / job done)
              │
              ▼
   ┌───────────────┐
   │     INFO      │
   └───────────────┘

      Diagnostic detail useful only when investigating
