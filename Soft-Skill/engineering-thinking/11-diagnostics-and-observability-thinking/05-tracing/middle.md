## Introduction

> Focus: **Keep the thread from breaking.** A trace is only as good as its weakest propagation boundary.

At junior level you started spans and watched a tree assemble itself — as long as everything happened in one function, on one thread, in one process. That's the easy 10%. The hard 90% of tracing is **propagation**: keeping the trace context attached as a request crosses a function boundary, an `await`, a thread-pool handoff, and — the big one — the **network** between two services.

The mechanism is the same everywhere, and it's worth saying plainly: a trace stays whole because each new span attaches to the **current context**, and that context must be *carried* across every boundary. In-process, "carried" means a `context.Context` argument (Go) or a context-local variable (Python `contextvars`, Node `async_hooks`, Java thread-local). Cross-service, "carried" means **injecting the context into the outgoing request's headers and extracting it on the other side** — and the standard headers for that are the W3C **`traceparent`** and **`tracestate`**.

This page is the propagation playbook. We'll cover both directions of crossing — in-process and over the wire — then the two ways spans get created (you write them *manually*, or an *agent/instrumentation library* writes them for you), then how to make spans *useful* (attributes, events, status, kind, and the semantic conventions that make backends light up), and finally the highest-ROI integration in observability: **stamping the trace ID onto every log line** so you can pivot from a log to its trace and back.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at middle level:** A senior doesn't memorize more span methods than you. A senior *never loses the context*. They know that the truncated-looking trace, the orphan span, the "the request just vanished after the gateway" mystery — all three are the same bug: propagation dropped at a boundary. Master the boundaries and 90% of tracing problems disappear.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** All of [`junior.md`](junior.md) — span anatomy, starting/ending spans, attributes vs events, the orphan-span failure mode.
- **Required:** You can run a small HTTP server and client in at least one of Go, Python, Java, Node, Rust.
- **Required:** You know what an HTTP header is and that requests carry them.
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with `async`/`await` (Python, JS) or goroutines (Go) — the boundaries where context loss happens.
- **Helpful:** Structured logging. See [`../02-logging/middle.md`](../02-logging/middle.md). The correlation pattern joins the two disciplines.
- **Helpful:** A running local backend (Jaeger via Docker is one command) so you can *see* propagated traces, not just console output.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Context** | The immutable bundle carried with a request: the active span context (trace ID, span ID, flags) plus baggage. |
| **Propagation** | Moving the context across a boundary so the next span attaches to the right parent. |
| **Propagator** | The component that serializes context into a carrier (inject) and reads it back (extract). |
| **Carrier** | The medium the context travels in — usually HTTP headers, or a message-queue header map. |
| **`traceparent`** | The W3C header that carries `version-traceid-spanid-flags`, e.g. `00-4bf9...-00f0...-01`. |
| **`tracestate`** | The companion W3C header carrying vendor-specific key-value state across hops. |
| **B3** | Zipkin's older propagation format (`X-B3-TraceId`, `X-B3-SpanId`, …). Still common; you may need to support both. |
| **Baggage** | Arbitrary key-value pairs propagated *alongside* the trace (e.g. `tenant=acme`) — not span attributes. |
| **Inject** | Write the current context into an outgoing carrier (headers). |
| **Extract** | Read context from an incoming carrier and make it the parent for new spans. |
| **Auto-instrumentation** | Spans created without you writing them — via a Java agent, Python `opentelemetry-instrument`, or Node auto-loaders. |
| **Manual instrumentation** | Spans you write yourself for your business logic. |
| **Span kind** | `SERVER`, `CLIENT`, `PRODUCER`, `CONSUMER`, `INTERNAL` — the role of the span; drives cross-service stitching. |
| **Span link** | A non-parent reference from one span to another (e.g. batch processing, fan-in). |
| **Semantic conventions** | OTel's standardized attribute names (`http.request.method`, `db.system`, …). |
| **Resource** | Attributes describing the *emitter*: `service.name`, `service.version`, host, region. Set once per process. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Context Is the Trace; Spans Are Just Its Footprints

Reframe the whole thing: the unit that travels is **context**, not spans. A span is what gets *created* when work happens inside a context. Keep the context flowing correctly and the spans nest correctly for free. Lose the context and no amount of careful span code saves you. Propagation is the discipline of *never losing the context*.

### 2. In-Process and Cross-Service Are the Same Idea, Different Carrier

Crossing a function call inside one process and crossing the network to another process are the *same operation*: take the current context, hand it to the next unit of work. The only difference is the **carrier**. In-process the carrier is a language construct (`ctx`, `contextvars`, thread-local). Cross-service the carrier is **headers** — and you must explicitly *inject* on the way out and *extract* on the way in.

### 3. Inject on the Client, Extract on the Server

The cross-service contract has exactly two halves. The **client** span injects `traceparent` into the outgoing request headers. The **server** on the other end extracts `traceparent` from the incoming headers and starts its root span as a *child* of what it found. Get both halves and the two services share one trace. Skip either half and you get two disconnected traces that should have been one.

### 4. Auto-Instrumentation Does the Boring 80%; You Write the Meaningful 20%

You almost never hand-write spans for HTTP servers, HTTP clients, gRPC, or database drivers — instrumentation *libraries* (or a Java agent) do that, and they also handle inject/extract for you. Your job is the spans that the machine *can't* guess: the business operations (`reserve_inventory`, `score_fraud`, `apply_promotion`). The art is layering thin manual spans on top of rich auto spans.

### 5. A Span Without Good Attributes Is Half a Span

A span named `db.query` that lasted 400ms tells you *where*; the attributes (`db.system=postgresql`, `db.statement=SELECT...`, `db.rows=10000`) tell you *why*. Useful tracing is mostly about attaching the right, standard, low-cardinality-where-it-counts attributes — and never the wrong ones (PII, secrets, unbounded cardinality).

### 6. The Trace ID in Your Logs Is the Cheapest Win You'll Ever Ship

Once the trace ID is on every log line, you get bidirectional pivoting: from a slow trace, jump to its logs; from an error log, jump to its trace. This single integration turns three separate tools into one investigation. It costs a few lines in your log formatter.

---

## In-Process Context Propagation

Inside one process, the context is implicit in most languages and explicit in Go. **Every boundary that doesn't carry it forward is a place the trace can break.**

| Language | How the active context is carried | Where it silently breaks |
|---|---|---|
| **Go** | Explicit `context.Context`, threaded as the first argument. | Passing `context.Background()`; launching a goroutine with the wrong (or no) `ctx`. |
| **Python** | `contextvars` (the SDK uses them automatically). | `asyncio` is fine; **`ThreadPoolExecutor` / raw threads** lose it unless you copy the context. |
| **Node.js** | `AsyncLocalStorage` via `async_hooks` (installed by `provider.register()`). | Some callback-style libs and certain `setImmediate`/event-emitter paths break the async chain. |
| **Java** | Thread-local (`Context.current()` / `makeCurrent()`). | **New threads, executors, `CompletableFuture`** — must wrap with `Context.taskWrapping(...)`. |
| **Rust** | The `tracing` subscriber tracks the entered span. | `tokio::spawn` of a future without `.instrument(span)` loses the span. |

The pattern to internalize: **synchronous, same-thread code propagates for free; the moment you hop a thread, a pool, a goroutine, an executor, or a future, you must carry the context across by hand.** (Async runtimes and queues get a full treatment in `senior.md` and `professional.md`.)

```python
# Python: the classic in-process break — a thread pool loses the context.
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from opentelemetry import context as otel_context

def submit_with_context(pool, fn, *args):
    ctx = otel_context.get_current()          # capture HERE, on the parent thread
    def run():
        token = otel_context.attach(ctx)      # re-attach on the worker thread
        try:
            return fn(*args)
        finally:
            otel_context.detach(token)
    return pool.submit(run)
```

```go
// Go: the classic break — a goroutine that drops ctx.
go func() {
    // BAD: started a span from context.Background() -> orphan
    _, span := tracer.Start(context.Background(), "async.work")
    span.End()
}()

go func(ctx context.Context) {
    // GOOD: capture the parent ctx and pass it in
    _, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "async.work")
    span.End()
}(ctx)
```

---

## Cross-Service Propagation — W3C Trace Context

This is the heart of *distributed* tracing. When service A calls service B over HTTP, the trace context rides along in two standard headers.

### The `traceparent` header

```text
traceparent: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01
             │  │                                │                │
             │  └ trace-id (16 bytes hex)        └ parent span-id └ trace-flags
             └ version                              (8 bytes hex)    (01 = sampled)
```

- **version** — `00` today.
- **trace-id** — the shared ID for the whole request. Service B reuses it.
- **parent-id** — the span ID of A's *client* span. B's *server* span becomes its child.
- **trace-flags** — bit `01` means "this trace is sampled." B should honor this (parent-based sampling — see `senior.md`).

The companion **`tracestate`** header carries vendor-specific key-value state (`tracestate: rojo=00f067,congo=t61rcWk`). You rarely touch it by hand; propagators manage it.

### Inject (client) → Extract (server)

```text
   SERVICE A                                   SERVICE B
   ┌────────────────────────┐                  ┌──────────────────────────┐
   │ client span (CLIENT)   │                  │                          │
   │   inject() ──────────▶ traceparent header ──▶ extract()              │
   │                        │   over the wire  │   start server span      │
   │                        │                  │   (SERVER) as CHILD      │
   └────────────────────────┘                  └──────────────────────────┘
   Same trace_id end to end. A's client span_id = B's server parent_id.
```

If you use auto-instrumented HTTP clients and servers, **this happens for you** — the instrumentation injects on the way out and extracts on the way in. You only do it by hand for protocols the libraries don't cover (custom RPC, a message queue, a webhook).

### Configuring the propagator

OpenTelemetry defaults to W3C `traceparent`+`baggage`. If you interoperate with an older Zipkin/B3 fleet, configure a composite propagator so you read *and* write both:

```python
# Python: support W3C and B3 simultaneously (migration / mixed fleet).
from opentelemetry.propagate import set_global_textmap
from opentelemetry.propagators.composite import CompositePropagator
from opentelemetry.trace.propagation.tracecontext import TraceContextTextMapPropagator
from opentelemetry.propagators.b3 import B3MultiFormat

set_global_textmap(CompositePropagator([
    TraceContextTextMapPropagator(),  # W3C traceparent
    B3MultiFormat(),                  # X-B3-* headers
]))
```

> **The #1 cross-service bug:** A injects W3C `traceparent`, but B only knows how to extract B3 (or vice versa). Both look correctly instrumented in isolation; together they produce *two* traces. When a trace "stops at a service boundary," check that both sides agree on the propagation format **first**.

## Manual vs Auto Instrumentation

| | Auto-instrumentation | Manual instrumentation |
|---|---|---|
| **What it traces** | Frameworks: HTTP server/client, gRPC, DB drivers, Kafka, Redis, AWS SDK. | *Your* business logic: `reserve_inventory`, `score_fraud`. |
| **Who writes the spans** | An agent or instrumentation library. | You. |
| **Propagation** | Handled for you (inject/extract on framework calls). | You ensure the right context is in scope. |
| **Effort** | One-time setup; near-zero per-endpoint. | Per-operation code. |
| **Coverage** | Wide but shallow — knows the call happened, not *why*. | Narrow but deep — knows the business meaning. |
| **Risk** | Span explosion; over-broad attribute capture (can grab PII from headers/queries). | Forgetting to end spans; wrong context. |

**The right answer is both.** Turn on auto-instrumentation to get the skeleton (every HTTP and DB call traced + propagated for free), then *manually* add the handful of spans that describe what your service actually does. Auto gives you the bones; manual gives you the meaning.

### Java — auto-instrumentation via the agent (zero code)

```bash
# Download opentelemetry-javaagent.jar once, then:
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.service.name=checkout \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://collector:4317 \
     -jar checkout.jar
# Every Servlet, JDBC call, JDBC pool, Kafka client, gRPC stub is now traced
# AND traceparent is injected/extracted automatically. You wrote no span code.
```

### Python — auto-instrumentation via the launcher

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-distro opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask \
            opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
opentelemetry-bootstrap -a install          # pull instrumentations for your libs
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=checkout \
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317 \
opentelemetry-instrument python app.py      # wraps Flask, requests, psycopg2, ...
```

### Node — auto-instrumentation via a preloaded module

```js
// tracing.js — load this BEFORE your app via: node --require ./tracing.js app.js
const { NodeSDK } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node");
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } =
  require("@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node");
const { OTLPTraceExporter } = require("@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http");

new NodeSDK({
  serviceName: "checkout",
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({ url: "http://collector:4318/v1/traces" }),
  instrumentations: [getNodeAutoInstrumentations()], // http, express, pg, redis, ...
}).start();
```

---

## Attributes, Events, Status, Kind

The four levers that turn a bare span into a useful one.

### Attributes — describe the whole span

```python
span.set_attribute("http.request.method", "POST")
span.set_attribute("http.route", "/checkout")       # template, NOT /checkout/42
span.set_attribute("db.system", "postgresql")
span.set_attribute("payment.amount_cents", 1000)    # your own namespaced key
```

Rules: prefer **semantic-convention keys** where they exist; keep values **low-to-moderate cardinality**; **never** put secrets/PII. A high-cardinality attribute (a UUID per request) is fine *as an attribute* (it doesn't multiply storage like a high-cardinality *metric label* would), but it does inflate index size — be intentional.

### Events — timestamped notes within the span

```go
span.AddEvent("cache.miss")
span.AddEvent("retry", trace.WithAttributes(attribute.Int("attempt", 2)))
```

Use events for *moments*: a cache miss, a retry, a validation failure that didn't abort. An event is closer to a structured log line scoped to this span than to an attribute.

### Status — success or failure

```java
try {
    doWork();
    span.setStatus(StatusCode.OK);                  // optional on success
} catch (Exception e) {
    span.recordException(e);                         // attaches stack as an event
    span.setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR, e.getMessage()); // paints it red, filterable
    throw e;
}
```

`recordException` + `setStatus(ERROR)` is the pair that makes "show me failed traces" work. An un-statused error is invisible to error filters.

### Span kind — the role

| Kind | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER` | You are *handling* an inbound request. | Your HTTP handler's root span. |
| `CLIENT` | You are *making* an outbound call. | Your DB query, your HTTP call to Stripe. |
| `PRODUCER` | You *enqueue* a message. | Publishing to Kafka/SQS. |
| `CONSUMER` | You *process* a message. | A Kafka consumer handling a record. |
| `INTERNAL` | Plain in-process work. | A business-logic span. The default. |

Kind drives the UI's cross-service stitching (a `CLIENT` span links to the matching `SERVER` span). For producer/consumer across a queue, you usually link rather than parent — see `senior.md`.

---

## Semantic Conventions

OpenTelemetry publishes **semantic conventions** — standardized attribute names so that *every* backend understands `http.request.method`, `db.system`, `messaging.system`, `url.full`, regardless of who emitted them. Using them is the difference between a generic span and one that lights up a purpose-built UI (a DB span that shows the query, an HTTP span that shows the route and status).

| Domain | Key conventions (current names) |
|---|---|
| HTTP server | `http.request.method`, `http.route`, `http.response.status_code`, `url.path`, `server.address` |
| HTTP client | `http.request.method`, `url.full`, `http.response.status_code`, `server.address` |
| Database | `db.system`, `db.namespace`, `db.query.text`, `db.operation.name` |
| Messaging | `messaging.system`, `messaging.destination.name`, `messaging.operation` |
| RPC | `rpc.system`, `rpc.service`, `rpc.method` |
| General | `service.name`, `service.version` (resource), `error.type` |

Two notes: (1) the conventions **evolved** — older code uses `http.method`/`http.status_code`, newer uses `http.request.method`/`http.response.status_code`; pin a version and migrate deliberately. (2) `service.name` lives on the **Resource** (set once per process), not on each span. A missing `service.name` shows up as `unknown_service` in every backend — set it.

---

## Correlating Trace IDs Into Logs

The single highest-leverage integration in observability. Get the **trace ID** (and span ID) onto every log line, and your logs and traces become two views of the same investigation.

The mechanism: the SDK exposes the *current* span context; your log formatter reads it and adds `trace_id` / `span_id` fields.

```python
# Python: structlog/logging processor that injects trace_id into every record.
import logging
from opentelemetry import trace

class TraceContextFilter(logging.Filter):
    def filter(self, record):
        ctx = trace.get_current_span().get_span_context()
        record.trace_id = format(ctx.trace_id, "032x") if ctx.is_valid else "-"
        record.span_id = format(ctx.span_id, "016x") if ctx.is_valid else "-"
        return True
# Then add %(trace_id)s to your formatter. Every log line now carries the trace.
```

```go
// Go: pull the trace_id out of ctx for slog.
func logWith(ctx context.Context) *slog.Logger {
    sc := trace.SpanContextFromContext(ctx)
    return slog.Default().With(
        "trace_id", sc.TraceID().String(),
        "span_id", sc.SpanID().String(),
    )
}
// usage: logWith(ctx).Info("charge failed", "err", err)
```

Now the workflow is: metric alert → click the exemplar → open the trace → spot the red span → click through to *exactly the log lines* of that request (filtered by `trace_id`). Three tools, one thread. (The reverse — from a customer's error log to its trace — works identically.) See [`../02-logging/middle.md`](../02-logging/middle.md) for the structured-logging foundation this builds on. The *metric* side of the same idea (exemplars) is a `professional.md` topic.

---

## Code Examples

A complete two-service example: a `gateway` calls a `pricing` service over HTTP. The trace must span both.

### Go — manual inject/extract (what auto-instrumentation does for you)

```go
// --- gateway (client side) ---
func callPricing(ctx context.Context, tracer trace.Tracer) (*http.Response, error) {
	ctx, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "GET pricing", trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindClient))
	defer span.End()

	req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "http://pricing/quote", nil)
	// INJECT the current context into the outgoing headers:
	otel.GetTextMapPropagator().Inject(ctx, propagation.HeaderCarrier(req.Header))
	return http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
}

// --- pricing (server side) ---
func pricingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// EXTRACT the context from incoming headers, then start a SERVER span as child:
	ctx := otel.GetTextMapPropagator().Extract(r.Context(),
		propagation.HeaderCarrier(r.Header))
	ctx, span := otel.Tracer("pricing").Start(ctx, "GET /quote",
		trace.WithSpanKind(trace.SpanKindServer))
	defer span.End()

	span.SetAttributes(semconv.HTTPRouteKey.String("/quote"))
	w.Write([]byte(`{"price": 100}`))
}
```

In practice you'd use `otelhttp.NewHandler` and `otelhttp.NewTransport` and never write inject/extract by hand — but seeing it once makes the magic legible.

### Python — Flask + requests, auto-instrumented

```python
# Run with: opentelemetry-instrument python gateway.py
import requests
from flask import Flask
from opentelemetry import trace

app = Flask(__name__)
tracer = trace.get_tracer("gateway")

@app.get("/checkout")
def checkout():
    # Flask auto-instrumentation already extracted the incoming context and
    # made a SERVER span. We add a manual business span underneath it:
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("business.checkout") as span:
        span.set_attribute("checkout.step", "price")
        # requests auto-instrumentation INJECTS traceparent automatically:
        resp = requests.get("http://pricing/quote")   # CLIENT span + propagation, free
        span.set_attribute("pricing.status", resp.status_code)
        return {"ok": True}
```

The two auto-instrumentations (Flask + requests) handle extract-on-entry and inject-on-exit; your one manual span carries the business meaning.

### Node — Express + axios, with the trace ID in logs

```js
// Loaded via: node --require ./tracing.js server.js  (see auto-instrument section)
const express = require("express");
const axios = require("axios");
const { trace, context } = require("@opentelemetry/api");
const app = express();

function log(level, msg, extra = {}) {
  const span = trace.getSpan(context.active());
  const sc = span?.spanContext();
  console.log(JSON.stringify({
    level, msg, ...extra,
    trace_id: sc?.traceId ?? "-",      // ← correlation: trace_id on every log line
    span_id: sc?.spanId ?? "-",
  }));
}

app.get("/checkout", async (req, res) => {
  log("info", "checkout.start");                 // carries the trace_id
  // axios auto-instrumentation injects traceparent into this outgoing call:
  const { data } = await axios.get("http://pricing/quote");
  log("info", "checkout.priced", { price: data.price });
  res.json({ ok: true });
});
```

### Java — manual span layered on the agent's auto spans

```java
// Running under -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar: the Servlet + the
// outbound HttpClient are already traced and propagated. You add meaning:
import io.opentelemetry.api.GlobalOpenTelemetry;
import io.opentelemetry.api.trace.*;
import io.opentelemetry.context.Scope;

Tracer tracer = GlobalOpenTelemetry.getTracer("checkout");

void handleCheckout(long userId) {
    Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("business.checkout")
        .setSpanKind(SpanKind.INTERNAL).startSpan();
    try (Scope s = span.makeCurrent()) {
        span.setAttribute("user.id", userId);
        priceCart();              // the agent traces the outbound HTTP call inside
        span.setStatus(StatusCode.OK);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        span.recordException(e);
        span.setStatus(StatusCode.ERROR);
        throw e;
    } finally {
        span.end();
    }
}
```

### Rust — propagate across an HTTP call with `tracing-opentelemetry`

```rust
// Cargo.toml: tracing, tracing-opentelemetry, opentelemetry, opentelemetry-http, reqwest
use opentelemetry::global;
use opentelemetry_http::HeaderInjector;
use tracing::Instrument;
use tracing_opentelemetry::OpenTelemetrySpanExt;

async fn call_pricing() -> reqwest::Result<String> {
    let span = tracing::info_span!("GET pricing");
    async {
        let cx = tracing::Span::current().context();   // OTel context of this span
        let mut req = reqwest::Request::new(
            reqwest::Method::GET, "http://pricing/quote".parse().unwrap());
        // INJECT traceparent into the outgoing headers:
        global::get_text_map_propagator(|prop| {
            prop.inject_context(&cx, &mut HeaderInjector(req.headers_mut()));
        });
        reqwest::Client::new().execute(req).await?.text().await
    }
    .instrument(span)         // ← keep the span attached across the await
    .await
}
```

Note the `.instrument(span)` — in Rust async you must explicitly attach the span to the future, or the context is lost across the `await`. That's the Rust version of the propagation rule.

## Pros & Cons

| Decision | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-instrumentation** | Wide coverage instantly; propagation for free; no per-endpoint work. | Span explosion risk; may capture over-broad/PII attributes; less business meaning. |
| **Manual instrumentation** | Exactly the spans that matter; business semantics; full control. | Per-operation effort; forget-to-end and wrong-context bugs. |
| **W3C `traceparent`** | The standard; every backend speaks it; future-proof. | Older fleets use B3 — interop needs a composite propagator. |
| **Trace ID in logs** | Pivot logs↔traces; huge debugging speedup; cheap. | Requires a formatter change in every service; consistency matters. |
| **Semantic conventions** | Backends light up purpose-built UIs; portable. | They evolve (`http.method` → `http.request.method`); migration churn. |

---

## Use Cases

- **"The trace stops at the gateway."** Propagation broke at the gateway→backend hop — usually a format mismatch (W3C vs B3) or a missing inject/extract. Check both sides agree.
- **"I see two traces for one request."** Same cause: the downstream started a fresh root instead of extracting the incoming context.
- **"The DB call is slow but I can't see the query."** Add the `db.query.text` semantic attribute (auto-instrumentation often does, if enabled).
- **"I have the trace but want the logs."** Trace ID in logs → filter logs by `trace_id`.
- **"A background thread's work is missing from the trace."** In-process context lost at the thread/pool boundary — capture-and-reattach the context.
- **"Everything's an orphan in this service."** The server isn't extracting incoming context, or auto-instrumentation isn't installed.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern: Thread `ctx` everywhere in Go

```go
// ctx is ALWAYS the first parameter. This is the propagation contract.
func (s *Service) Checkout(ctx context.Context, userID int) error {
    ctx, span := s.tracer.Start(ctx, "Checkout")
    defer span.End()
    if err := s.loadCart(ctx, userID); err != nil { // pass ctx down
        return err
    }
    return s.charge(ctx, userID)                      // pass ctx down
}
```

### Pattern: One manual span per business operation, auto for the rest

```python
@app.post("/order")
def create_order():                       # SERVER span: auto (Flask)
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("reserve_inventory"):  # manual: business
        reserve()                          # the DB call inside: auto (psycopg2)
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("charge_payment"):     # manual: business
        requests.post(...)                 # the HTTP call inside: auto (requests)
```

### Pattern: Always pair recordException with setStatus(ERROR)

```go
if err != nil {
    span.RecordException(err)
    span.SetStatus(codes.Error, err.Error())
    return err
}
```

### Pattern: Set `service.name` on the Resource, once

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource
provider = TracerProvider(resource=Resource.create({"service.name": "checkout"}))
# Without this, every backend shows "unknown_service". Non-negotiable.
```

---

## Clean Code

- **`service.name` is mandatory.** A trace without it is unattributable. Set it on the Resource.
- **Inject and extract are symmetric** — if one service injects W3C, every service must extract W3C (or run a composite propagator). Standardize fleet-wide.
- **Prefer instrumentation libraries** (`otelhttp`, `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*`, the Java agent) over hand-rolled inject/extract. Less code, fewer bugs.
- **Use semantic-convention attribute names**; namespace your custom ones (`company.checkout.step`).
- **Trace ID in every log line** — make it a shared logging-library default, not a per-service afterthought.
- **End spans with scope-bound helpers** (`defer`, `with`, try-with-resources, `startActiveSpan`) so an early return or exception can't leak them.
- **Don't let auto-instrumentation capture full request/response bodies or all headers** — that's where PII leaks in. Configure the capture list.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Turn on auto-instrumentation first**, confirm propagation works end-to-end (one trace across two services), *then* add manual business spans.
2. **Standardize one propagation format** across the fleet (W3C `traceparent`); add B3 only for interop, via a composite propagator.
3. **Put the trace ID in logs in a shared library** so every service does it identically.
4. **Set the Resource** (`service.name`, `service.version`, deployment environment) once per process.
5. **Use the right span kind** — `CLIENT`/`SERVER` for calls, `PRODUCER`/`CONSUMER` for queues — so cross-service stitching works.
6. **Record exceptions and set ERROR status** on every failure path you care about.
7. **Audit auto-instrumentation's attribute capture** for PII before shipping (headers, query strings, bodies).
8. **Test propagation explicitly**: a test that asserts service B's span has service A's trace ID. Propagation breaks silently otherwise.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Format mismatch across services.** A injects W3C, B extracts only B3 → two traces. The most common "trace stops at the boundary" cause.
- **Thread-pool / executor handoff.** Python `ThreadPoolExecutor`, Java `ExecutorService`, `CompletableFuture` lose the context unless you capture-and-reattach (or wrap the executor).
- **`tokio::spawn` without `.instrument`** drops the Rust span across the spawn boundary.
- **Manual inject without a started client span.** Injecting the *parent's* context (not a fresh client span) makes the downstream a child of the wrong span — subtle but wrong nesting.
- **Auto-instrumentation capturing secrets.** Default header/query capture can grab `Authorization`, `?token=...`. Configure the denylist.
- **Mixing global and explicit propagators.** If `set_global_textmap` and a local propagator disagree, inject/extract use different formats. Pick one source of truth.
- **`http.route` set to the concrete path** (`/users/42`) instead of the template (`/users/:id`) — re-introduces the cardinality problem at the attribute level for routing UIs.
- **Logs and traces using different ID encodings** (one hex, one decimal) — they won't join. Standardize on 32-hex-char trace IDs.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Assuming auto-instrumentation handles your custom RPC or queue.** It covers known libraries; custom transports need manual inject/extract.
2. **Different propagation formats on the two ends of a call.** Two traces where one was intended.
3. **Forgetting to set `service.name`.** Everything shows as `unknown_service`.
4. **Losing context across a thread/goroutine/future** and not noticing because the in-process spans still *mostly* connect.
5. **Putting concrete IDs in `http.route`** or span names — cardinality returns through the back door.
6. **Recording an exception but not setting ERROR status** (or vice versa) — half-marked failures.
7. **Letting auto-instrumentation log full bodies/headers** — PII and secret leakage.
8. **Trace ID in logs done per-service, inconsistently** — some hex, some decimal, some missing. Centralize it.
9. **Injecting context without first starting a CLIENT span** — wrong parent for the downstream.
10. **Treating events like attributes** (or vice versa) — events are timestamped moments; attributes describe the whole span.

---

## Tricky Points

- **`traceparent`'s `parent-id` is the *caller's span ID*, not the trace's root.** The downstream's server span parents to the *immediate* caller's client span, building the tree hop by hop.
- **The sampled flag in `traceparent` (`-01`) is a hint the downstream should honor.** Parent-based sampling means if the parent was sampled, the child should be too — otherwise you get half-traces. See `senior.md`.
- **`baggage` ≠ span attributes.** Baggage propagates across services (in the `baggage` header) and is readable everywhere downstream; attributes stay on their span. Baggage is powerful and dangerous (it's also a PII-leak and a header-bloat vector — `professional.md`).
- **Auto + manual can double-count.** If you manually wrap an HTTP call that auto-instrumentation also wraps, you get two spans for one call. Know what's already instrumented.
- **Context extraction must happen *before* you start the server span**, or the server span won't be a child of the caller. Order matters.
- **`makeCurrent()`/`attach` must be paired with close/`detach`.** Leaking the scope corrupts the context for unrelated later work on the same thread.
- **A `CLIENT` span's duration includes network + remote processing**, while the remote `SERVER` span only covers remote processing. The gap between them is the network/queue time — a useful signal, not a bug.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Stand up two tiny HTTP services (gateway → pricing) with auto-instrumentation. Confirm in Jaeger that **one** trace spans both, sharing one trace ID.
2. Break it on purpose: configure the gateway to inject B3 and pricing to extract only W3C. Observe two separate traces. Fix it with a composite propagator.
3. Add a manual business span in the gateway between the auto SERVER span and the auto CLIENT call. Confirm the nesting in the waterfall.
4. Add the trace ID to your logs. Trigger an error, copy the `trace_id` from the log line, and find that exact trace in the UI.
5. In Python, submit work to a `ThreadPoolExecutor` and confirm the worker's span is an *orphan*. Fix it with capture-and-reattach.
6. Decode a real `traceparent` header by hand: name the version, trace-id, parent-id, and whether it's sampled.
7. Find one attribute your auto-instrumentation captures that you'd consider sensitive (an `Authorization` header? a query param?). Configure it out.
8. Set `service.name` and `service.version` on the Resource and confirm they appear on every span in the backend.

---

## Tricky Questions

**Q1: A request is traced fine within each service, but the two services show up as separate traces. What's wrong?**

Cross-service propagation is broken. Either the client isn't injecting `traceparent`, the server isn't extracting it, or — most commonly — the two ends disagree on format (one W3C, one B3). Check that both sides use the same propagator; add a composite propagator if you must support both during a migration.

**Q2: What exactly is in a `traceparent` header, and which part does the downstream reuse?**

Four fields: `version-traceid-spanid-traceflags`. The downstream **reuses the trace-id** (so both services share one trace), treats the **span-id** as its parent (its server span becomes a child of the caller's client span), and **honors the sampled flag** for parent-based sampling.

**Q3: Do I need to write inject/extract code?**

Rarely. Instrumentation libraries (`otelhttp`, `requests`/`Flask` instrumentations, the Java agent, Node auto-instrumentations) inject and extract for you on standard protocols. You only do it by hand for transports the libraries don't cover — a custom binary RPC, a message queue, a webhook.

**Q4: My background-thread work doesn't appear under the request's trace. Why?**

The in-process context didn't cross the thread boundary. `contextvars`/thread-locals are per-thread; when you hand work to a pool, capture the current OTel context on the submitting thread and re-attach it on the worker thread (or use a context-propagating executor wrapper).

**Q5: What's the difference between baggage and a span attribute?**

A **span attribute** stays on the span it's set on. **Baggage** is propagated across services in the `baggage` header and is readable by *every* downstream service. Use baggage to carry a small, non-sensitive value (a tenant ID) that many services need; never put PII in it, and keep it tiny — it rides on every request.

**Q6: Why is putting the trace ID in logs such a big deal?**

It joins three tools into one. From a slow trace you jump to its logs; from an error log you jump to its trace; from a metric exemplar you reach both. Without it, you're grepping nine services' logs by hand trying to reconstruct what the trace already shows you. It costs a few lines in the log formatter and pays back on every incident.

**Q7: I turned on auto-instrumentation and now I have thousands of tiny spans. Is that normal?**

It can be — some instrumentations are chatty (an ORM that traces every statement, a client that traces every retry). It's a span-explosion risk and a cost driver. Tune the instrumentation's verbosity, disable the noisy ones, and lean on sampling (`senior.md`). Auto-instrumentation is a starting point, not a finished configuration.

## Summary

- A trace stays whole only if **context is propagated across every boundary**. The context is the trace; spans are its footprints.
- **In-process**, context rides a language construct: Go `ctx`, Python `contextvars`, Node `async_hooks`, Java thread-local, Rust's `tracing` span. It breaks at **thread/goroutine/pool/future** hops unless you carry it across.
- **Cross-service**, context rides **headers**: inject `traceparent` on the client, extract it on the server. The server reuses the trace-id and parents to the caller's span.
- **W3C `traceparent`** is the standard; **B3** is the legacy format; a **composite propagator** bridges a mixed fleet. Format mismatch is the #1 "trace stops at the boundary" bug.
- **Auto-instrumentation** traces frameworks/HTTP/DB/queues and propagates for free; **manual instrumentation** adds business meaning. Use both.
- Make spans useful with **attributes** (describe), **events** (moments), **status** (Ok/Error), and **kind** (CLIENT/SERVER/PRODUCER/CONSUMER) — and use **semantic conventions** so backends light up.
- Set **`service.name`** on the Resource, or everything is `unknown_service`.
- The cheapest huge win: **put the trace ID on every log line** and pivot freely between logs and traces. See [`../02-logging/middle.md`](../02-logging/middle.md).
- Audit auto-instrumentation for **PII/secret capture** before shipping.

---

## What You Can Build

- A **two-service propagation demo** (gateway → pricing) with auto-instrumentation, exported to a local Jaeger, proving one trace spans both — then a branch that *breaks* it with a format mismatch so you can recognize the symptom.
- A **shared logging middleware** for your language that injects `trace_id`/`span_id` into every log line, so every service correlates logs↔traces identically.
- A **propagation test harness**: spin up two services in-process, send a request, assert the downstream span carries the upstream trace ID. Wire it into CI so propagation can't silently regress.
- A **`traceparent` decoder** CLI: paste a header, get version/trace-id/span-id/sampled, plus a validity check.
- A **PII auditor** for auto-instrumentation: a script that fires a request with `Authorization` and `?token=` set and flags whether they leaked into captured span attributes.
- A **B3↔W3C bridge config** and a short doc explaining when each is on the wire — useful during a real migration.
