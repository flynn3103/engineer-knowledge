## Introduction

> Focus: **a question bank for E2E interviews — fundamentals, tooling, flakiness, and strategy — with model answers and notes on what each question is really testing.**

E2E questions separate engineers who've *written* tests from those who've *owned a suite*. Anyone can describe a Playwright test; the senior signal is knowing that E2E is for confidence not coverage, that flakiness destroys trust, and that the right answer is often "push this down to a contract test." Each question below shows the **Q**, *what's really being tested*, and a model **A**.

---

## Prerequisites

- Working knowledge across [Junior](./junior.md) → [Professional](./professional.md) tiers.
- Comfort with the [test pyramid](../01-test-strategy-and-the-pyramid/README.md), [integration](../03-integration-testing/README.md), and [contract testing](../05-contract-testing/README.md).

## Fundamentals

**Q: What is an end-to-end test, and what does it prove that other tests can't?**
*what's really being tested: do you understand E2E's unique value, not just its definition.*
**A:** An E2E test exercises the whole, fully-integrated system through its real interface — real frontend, backend, database, network — driving it as a user would (browser, API, or CLI). It's the only level that proves the *assembled product actually works for the user*: that the pieces unit and integration tests verified in isolation also work together in the real environment. That's its unique value, and the reason for its cost.

**Q: Where does E2E sit in the test pyramid, and why?**
*what's really being tested: pyramid literacy and cost awareness.*
**A:** At the top — fewest tests. E2E is slow (seconds to minutes), flaky, and expensive to maintain, but gives the highest confidence. The pyramid says: many fast unit tests at the base, fewer integration tests, a thin layer of E2E. Invert that and you get the **ice-cream cone** anti-pattern: a slow, flaky suite nobody trusts.

**Q: "E2E for confidence, not coverage." Explain.**
*what's really being tested: do you know the selection discipline.*
**A:** You don't use E2E to exercise every branch — that's what cheap unit/integration tests are for. E2E exists to give confidence that the *critical user journeys* (login, checkout, signup) hold end-to-end. You write a handful covering the spine of the product and push everything else down the pyramid.

**Q: Why is the ice-cream cone an anti-pattern?**
*what's really being tested: can you articulate the failure mode concretely.*
**A:** Too many E2E tests relative to lower levels means the suite is slow (can't run on every PR), flaky (each test has many failure points), expensive to maintain (UI changes break many at once), and hard to debug (failures point at "something on the page"). Teams start ignoring red builds, and the suite stops protecting anyone.

---

## Technique

**Q: Walk me through writing a stable Playwright E2E test for login.**
*what's really being tested: hands-on fluency and web-first assertions.*
**A:**
```ts
test('user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.getByLabel('Email').fill('ada@example.com');
  await page.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log in' }).click();
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Dashboard' })).toBeVisible();
});
```
Key points: role/label locators (also assert accessibility), and a **web-first assertion** (`expect(...).toBeVisible()`) that auto-retries until the heading appears — no manual waits.

**Q: How do you choose selectors, and what do you avoid?**
*what's really being tested: do you know brittle selectors are the top maintenance cost.*
**A:** Priority: `getByRole` (role + accessible name) → `getByLabel`/`getByText` → `getByTestId`. Avoid CSS classes, tag structure, `nth-child`, and positional XPath — they couple tests to incidental DOM/styling and break on any refactor. For non-semantic or frequently-changing UI, add a `data-testid` that travels with the component.

**Q: Compare Playwright, Cypress, and Selenium.**
*what's really being tested: tool awareness and judgment.*
**A:** **Playwright** — out-of-process driver, auto-wait, true parallelism, tracing, multi-browser, built-in API testing; the modern default. **Cypress** — runs inside the browser, excellent DX and time-travel debugger, but historically constrained on multi-tab/origin. **Selenium/WebDriver** — the long-standing standard with the broadest language/browser support, but more boilerplate and more flake without careful explicit waits. I default to Playwright for its auto-waiting, which removes the biggest flakiness source.

**Q: What is the Page Object Model and why use it?**
*what's really being tested: maintainability of a growing suite.*
**A:** A POM is a class that encapsulates a page's locators and actions behind intention-revealing methods (`login.login(email, pw)`, `login.expectLoggedIn()`). It centralizes selectors so a UI change touches one file instead of twenty, and makes specs read like user stories. Alternatives/refinements: Playwright fixtures, Cypress "app actions" (seed state via API instead of UI), and component/screen objects. Pitfall: god-class page objects — keep methods at user-intent level.

**Q: What's API-level E2E and when do you prefer it?**
*what's really being tested: do you know browser isn't the only E2E.*
**A:** Exercising the full stack via HTTP (e.g. `POST /orders` then `GET /orders/{id}`) without a browser. It still hits the real router, services, and DB end-to-end but skips rendering — far faster and less flaky. Prefer it when the *backend flow* is the risk; use browser E2E when the *UI itself* (a checkout form, a wizard) is the risk.

## Flakiness & Stability

**Q: A teammate fixes a failing test with `await page.waitForTimeout(3000)`. Critique it.**
*what's really being tested: the single most important E2E principle.*
**A:** It's wrong on both ends: on slow CI 3s may be too short (random failures), on fast machines it wastes 3s every run (slow suite), and it hides the app's real timing. **"`sleep` is a bug."** The fix is to wait for the actual condition via a web-first assertion:
```ts
await expect(page.getByTestId('confirmation')).toContainText('Thank you');
```
This retries exactly as long as needed and no longer.

**Q: What causes flaky E2E tests, and how do you fix each?**
*what's really being tested: breadth of root-cause knowledge.*
**A:** Fixed sleeps → auto-wait/web-first assertions. Shared state between tests → isolation, fresh data per test. Non-deterministic data (dates, randoms, autoincrement IDs) → seed deterministic data, control the clock. Order dependence → each test runnable alone in any order. Animations → disable in test env. Third-party flakiness → stub at the network layer / use sandboxes. The unifying theme: eliminate every source of non-determinism.

**Q: When are blind retries acceptable, and what's the danger?**
*what's really being tested: nuance — do you treat the symptom or the disease.*
**A:** Retries (`retries: 2` in CI) can stabilize the pipeline, but they're a smoke alarm, not a fix. The danger: a blind retry can mask a genuine race condition or eventual-consistency bug in the *product*, not just the test. If a test only passes on retry, log it, capture a trace, and investigate before normalizing it. Quarantine with an owner if it's blocking.

**Q: How would you debug a test that fails only in CI, never locally?**
*what's really being tested: do you know about traces and systematic diagnosis.*
**A:** Capture artifacts — Playwright `trace: 'on-first-retry'`, screenshot and video on failure — and open the trace with `npx playwright show-trace`. The trace shows the exact DOM/network/console state at failure (often a cookie banner covering a button, a missing wait, or shared-state collision under parallelism). Reproduce locally with `--repeat-each=20 --workers=4` to surface races. Don't bump timeouts blindly.

**Q: How do you make state setup deterministic and fast?**
*what's really being tested: hermeticity and the seed-via-API principle.*
**A:** Seed state through the API or DB, not the UI — clicking through prerequisites is slow and brittle. Use a hermetic environment: fresh seeded DB, stubbed third parties, fixed clock (`page.clock.install`), seeded RNG, and per-worker namespaced data so parallel tests don't collide. A fixture can inject an already-authenticated page with a known account in milliseconds.

## Strategy & Scenarios

**Q: Your E2E suite takes 40 minutes and fails 1-in-5 runs. What do you do?**
*what's really being tested: the senior/staff judgment — diagnose, rebalance, govern.*
**A:** First, stop the bleeding: quarantine the worst flakes (with owners) so red means something again. Then rebalance the portfolio: identify E2E tests that exist only to verify service boundaries or backend logic and migrate them down to **contract** and **integration** tests — same confidence, far cheaper and more precise. Keep only true critical-journey E2E tests. Add sharding and parallelism for speed, capture traces for debuggability, and set a **budget** (max count + runtime) so it can't regrow. The goal is confidence per pipeline-minute, not test count.

**Q: When would you delete an E2E test rather than fix it?**
*what's really being tested: courage and portfolio thinking.*
**A:** When its risk is better covered lower down (replaceable by a contract/integration test), when it's been quarantined past its deadline (a quarantined test protects no one), or when the suite has grown so untrustworthy that developers route around it. Deletion is portfolio rebalancing, not failure — a 30-test reliable suite beats a 300-test suite nobody trusts. If the journey still matters, the deletion forces proper coverage.

**Q: When do you replace E2E with contract testing?**
*what's really being tested: knowing E2E's cheaper substitutes.*
**A:** When the risk is "do these two services agree on the interface?" — that's a contract test's job (Pact, Spring Cloud Contract): fast, local, precise failures, no full stack. An E2E test that breaks on a backend interface change was never really an E2E concern. Reserve E2E for the irreducible core: the real UI journey a user actually clicks through.

**Q: Where in CI should E2E run?**
*what's really being tested: CI topology judgment.*
**A:** A fast critical-journey **smoke subset** pre-merge (headless, sharded, kept under a tight time budget) so PRs stay fast; the **full suite** post-merge or nightly across all browsers for broader coverage; and a few read-only **smoke journeys against the deployment** pre/post-deploy to catch environment/config breakage. Always capture traces, screenshots, and video on failure.

**Q: How do you measure whether an E2E suite is healthy?**
*what's really being tested: do you manage by metrics, not vibes.*
**A:** Flake rate (per test and suite, target < ~1%), suite runtime (p50/p95 within budget), first-attempt pass rate, mean time to diagnose, quarantine count/age, cost per run, and — most important — **escaped defects in covered journeys**. The two key metrics pull opposite ways: flake rate (trustworthy?) and escaped defects (effective?). Govern both, and beware Goodhart — don't optimize test count or coverage % as a proxy.

---

## Rapid-Fire

**Q: One-line reason E2E is at the top of the pyramid?**
**A:** Highest confidence, highest cost — so fewest tests.

**Q: `getByRole` vs `.css-class` selector — which and why?**
**A:** `getByRole` — decoupled from styling, also asserts accessibility; CSS classes are brittle.

**Q: Web-first assertion in one sentence?**
**A:** An assertion that auto-retries until it passes or times out — no manual waits.

**Q: Seed cart state via UI or API?**
**A:** API — faster, deterministic, not brittle.

**Q: One Playwright artifact that makes CI failures debuggable?**
**A:** The trace (`show-trace`).

**Q: Sharding vs parallelism?**
**A:** Parallelism = multiple workers on one machine; sharding = splitting the suite across machines.

**Q: Prerequisite before parallelizing tests?**
**A:** Isolation — per-worker namespaced data so tests don't collide.

**Q: The cure for an existing ice-cream cone?**
**A:** Migrate E2E down to contract + integration tests; keep only true journeys.

**Q: Quarantine — what is it?**
**A:** Non-blocking isolation of a known-flaky test, with an owner and a deadline.

**Q: "`sleep` is a bug" — why?**
**A:** It guesses timing — too short flakes, too long slows the suite, and it hides real timing.

## Red Flags / Green Flags

**Green flags (strong candidate):**
- Says "E2E for confidence, not coverage" and means it — pushes coverage down the pyramid.
- Treats flakiness as the primary enemy; knows web-first assertions and "sleep is a bug."
- Prefers role/label/`data-testid` selectors; explains why CSS/position selectors rot.
- Reaches for contract/integration tests to *replace* E2E, not more E2E.
- Thinks in budgets, ownership, traces, quarantine, and health metrics.
- Mentions seeding state via API and hermetic environments.

**Red flags (weak candidate):**
- "We E2E-test everything to be safe" — the ice-cream cone, unaware.
- Fixes flake with `sleep` and blind retries; never mentions traces.
- Uses CSS-class/`nth-child` selectors as a default.
- Can't name a cheaper alternative (contract/integration) to E2E.
- No concept of test isolation, determinism, or a suite budget.
- Thinks more tests = more quality; optimizes coverage % over outcomes.

## Summary

- E2E proves the **whole integrated product works for the user** — its unique, irreducible value, and the reason it's costly.
- It belongs at the **top of the pyramid**: few, critical journeys only. The **ice-cream cone** is the canonical anti-pattern.
- **Flakiness is the #1 enemy.** Beat it with **web-first assertions** (never `sleep`), isolation, determinism, and third-party stubbing — not blind retries.
- Use **stable selectors**, **page objects/fixtures**, **hermetic environments**, **API seeding**, and **sharding** to keep a suite fast and trustworthy.
- The senior signal: **govern E2E as a budgeted, owned portfolio**, **replace it with contract+integration** where possible, **measure flake rate and escaped defects**, and have the **courage to shrink** an untrustworthy suite.
