# Acceptance & BDD — Professional

<!-- level-focus -->
At professional level, focus on this question:

> How should teams adopt and operate **Acceptance & BDD** with measurable outcomes and limited coordination?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Testing](../README.md) → Acceptance & BDD
>
> *Rolling BDD across an org is change management, not tool adoption. This tier is the introduction strategy, the example-mapping rollout, the traps to design out, and how to measure whether shared understanding actually improved.*

## Core Concept 1 — BDD Adoption Is Organisational Change

The single most expensive professional mistake is treating BDD adoption as a tooling project. It is a **behaviour change for humans**: getting business, dev, and QA to talk *before* coding, in a structured way, sustainably. The tool (Cucumber/SpecFlow/etc.) is the last 10% and the easy part.

Frame the rollout accordingly:

- **The unit of change is the conversation**, not the `.feature` file. If the conversation doesn't change, nothing of value changed.
- **Standards and CI cannot manufacture collaboration.** Mandating "every story must have Gherkin" without mandating the conversation guarantees devs writing Gherkin alone — the trap, at org scale.
- **It competes with culture.** If POs throw stories over the wall and devs prefer to work heads-down, BDD asks for a real change in how people interact. Budget for that, or don't start.

> Professional litmus test: *if you rolled out the Three Amigos conversation and example mapping but never installed any BDD tool, would the org be better off?* If yes, that's the real intervention — automation is optional and follows. If no, BDD isn't your problem.

## Core Concept 2 — Diagnosing Whether the Org Even Needs BDD

Before any rollout, diagnose the **communication gap** and **rule complexity** per domain. Not every team should do BDD, and a blanket mandate is how you create org-wide tax.

A simple decision aid:

```text
                          Complex business rules?
                         NO                    YES
                  ┌───────────────────┬───────────────────┐
  Real business   │  DON'T do BDD     │  BDD via shared    │
  ↔ dev ↔ QA      │  expressive plain │  conversation,     │
  gap?    YES     │  tests + good     │  living docs —      │
                  │  acceptance       │  STRONG fit         │
                  ├───────────────────┼───────────────────┤
                  │  DON'T do BDD     │  Maybe — examples   │
            NO    │  pure tax; unit + │  help devs reason,  │
                  │  integration      │  but watch the tax  │
                  └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

Domains in the top-right (insurance, lending, tax, healthcare eligibility, complex pricing, regulated workflows) are where BDD's collaboration value is real and large. Infrastructure/library/protocol teams are bottom-left — keep them off BDD. **Adopt by domain, never by mandate.**

---

## Core Concept 3 — Rolling Out Example Mapping and the Three Amigos

The practical seed of a BDD rollout is **example mapping**, because it makes the collaboration concrete, timeboxed, and low-ceremony — and crucially, it produces value (resolved ambiguity) *before* any code or Gherkin exists.

The session (25 minutes, four card colours):

```text
  🟨 YELLOW — the story under discussion (one card)
  🟦 BLUE   — a business RULE that constrains it
  🟩 GREEN  — a concrete EXAMPLE illustrating a rule
  🟥 RED    — an open QUESTION nobody can answer yet

  Worked example — "Refund a cancelled order":
   🟨 Refund a cancelled order
    🟦 Refund the full amount if cancelled before dispatch
       🟩 Order cancelled 1h after purchase, not yet dispatched → full refund
    🟦 Refund minus restocking fee if cancelled after dispatch
       🟩 Cancelled after dispatch, $100 order, 10% fee → $90 refund
       🟩 Digital goods → no restocking fee even after "dispatch"
    🟥 What about partial cancellations of a multi-item order?   ← UNRESOLVED
    🟥 Do gift-card payments refund to the card or as store credit?  ← UNRESOLVED
```

Rollout sequence that works:

1. **Pilot one team** in a top-right domain (Concept 2). Coach the conversation; let Gherkin emerge from green cards *only after* the session.
2. **Make "no red cards left" part of Definition of Ready.** This alone delivers value even if the team never automates a scenario — the ambiguity is gone before the sprint.
3. **Automate the green examples** that are critical journeys/rules; leave the rest as the agreed criteria.
4. **Spread by demonstrated win**, not decree. Other teams adopt when the pilot ships fewer "that's not what I meant" surprises.

The deliverable of step 1 is *fewer mid-sprint surprises*, not a folder of `.feature` files. Keep that ordering visible or the org will cargo-cult the artefacts.

## Core Concept 4 — Designing Out the Cucumber-Without-Collaboration Trap

At org scale, the trap (devs writing imperative Gherkin nobody reads, slow brittle browser suites, full tax / zero benefit) must be *designed out structurally*, because individual goodwill won't hold across dozens of teams.

Structural defences:

- **Don't mandate Gherkin; mandate the conversation.** A standard that says "stories in domains X/Y get an example-mapping session" targets the value. A standard that says "every PR needs a `.feature`" targets the tax.
- **Require a named non-dev reader per feature file.** If no PO/QA/analyst will read it, it shouldn't be Gherkin — it should be a plain test. Make this a review checklist item.
- **Lint against imperative steps.** A CI check that flags `click`, `type`, `wait`, `#id`, `xpath` in `.feature` files catches the brittlest anti-pattern automatically.
- **Cap browser-driven scenarios** via the pyramid policy and drive-layer guidance; provide an in-process/API driver harness so the fast path is the easy path (cross-ref [End-to-End Testing](../04-end-to-end-testing/)).
- **Periodic "reader audit."** Ask POs/QA whether they actually read the living docs. If a team's readers have gone silent, that team has slipped into tax — intervene or let them drop Gherkin.

> The standard you write determines the outcome. "Every story has Gherkin" produces org-wide tax. "Every complex-domain story has a Three Amigos conversation, recorded as examples a named non-dev reads" produces the benefit.

## Core Concept 5 — Living Documentation as a Platform Capability

When BDD fits, **living documentation** is the durable asset that often outlives the testing motive — and it's a platform capability worth investing in centrally.

What "platform-grade" living docs require:

- **Aggregation** across teams/services into one searchable behaviour catalogue (Serenity BDD, SpecFlow+ LivingDoc, Cucumber Reports, Pickles).
- **Freshness guarantee:** docs are published from the *passing* CI run, so green is a precondition of publication — stale docs are structurally impossible.
- **Audience routing:** auditors see compliance-tagged features; support sees user-journey features; new joiners get a curated subset.
- **Traceability:** scenarios tagged to requirements/tickets/regulations, so "show me the executable spec for control 8.2.1, all green" is one query — gold in regulated environments.

This is the clearest place BDD's by-product becomes a primary deliverable. But it remains conditional: living docs are only documentation if scenarios are **declarative** (Concept 4). The platform should *refuse to publish* imperative junk by failing the lint gate.

---

## Core Concept 6 — Measuring Whether Shared Understanding Improved

You must know if the investment paid off — and this is treacherous, because the obvious metrics are exactly the ones Goodhart's law destroys.

**Vanity metrics that invite gaming (avoid as targets):**

- *Number of scenarios* — maximised by writing useless scenarios.
- *Gherkin line count / "coverage by feature"* — rewards verbosity and the ice-cream cone.
- *% of stories with a `.feature` file* — produces devs writing Gherkin alone (the trap, mandated).

**Signals that actually track shared understanding:**

- **Rework rate / "that's not what I meant" defects** — bugs traced to *misunderstood requirements*, not code defects. BDD should drive this down; it's the most direct value signal.
- **Mid-sprint requirement clarifications** — should *fall* (resolved up front by example mapping) and shift *earlier* (into the conversation).
- **Story cycle time variance** — fewer nasty surprises means less right-skew in cycle time.
- **Escaped acceptance-criteria defects** — bugs where the system violated an *agreed* criterion; should approach zero if criteria are executable.
- **Qualitative: do non-devs read and trust the living docs?** A direct survey/audit beats any proxy. If POs cite the docs in conversations, the practice took.
- **Open-questions-resolved-before-sprint** (red cards closed in Definition of Ready) — a leading indicator of the conversation actually happening.

> Measure *outcomes* (less rework, fewer requirement-misunderstanding defects, more questions resolved early), never *artefacts* (scenario count). The moment "number of scenarios" becomes a target, teams will hit the target and lose the point — the canonical Goodhart failure, and the most common way BDD metrics mislead leadership into thinking a tax is a triumph.

## Core Concept 7 — Maintaining Acceptance Suites at Scale

Across many teams, acceptance suites decay unless governed as a platform concern:

- **A curated step-definition library** with reuse and naming conventions, owned like production code; otherwise every team reinvents `I log in` five ways and the catalogue rots.
- **Pyramid policy with teeth:** acceptance/E2E scenario budgets per service; CI placement that runs `@smoke` per-commit and full suites on a schedule (cross-ref [Test Strategy & the Pyramid](../01-test-strategy-and-the-pyramid/)).
- **Org-wide flake SLO.** Acceptance flake is the most expensive flake; track it, quarantine fast, and treat a chronically flaky suite as a reliability incident ([Flaky Tests & Reliability](../12-flaky-tests-and-reliability/)).
- **Drive-layer harness as paved road.** Provide in-process/API drivers so fast, stable acceptance tests are the default; making the slow browser path the *hard* path is your strongest lever against the ice-cream cone.
- **Periodic dead-scenario pruning.** Scenarios nobody reads and bugs that should've been unit tests accumulate; budget cleanup.

---

## Core Concept 8 — BDD, Requirements, and the Product Org

BDD only works if it reaches *into* the product/requirements process, not just the test code.

- **Examples become acceptance criteria become tests** — one artefact, one source of truth. If product writes criteria in a separate doc that drifts from the scenarios, you've lost specification-by-example's core benefit.
- **Definition of Ready ← example mapping.** "Open questions resolved" gates a story into a sprint; this is where BDD pays even when teams barely automate.
- **Ubiquitous language.** Scenarios are an excellent enforcer of a shared domain vocabulary (DDD); divergent terms in features signal a domain-model fracture worth fixing.
- **Don't let it ossify requirements.** Heavy upfront example mapping can drift toward big-design-up-front. Keep sessions timeboxed and per-story; the goal is shared understanding, not an exhaustive spec.

---

## Real-World Examples

- **Regulated lender, successful rollout.** Started with example mapping on the eligibility domain (top-right). "Red cards resolved" entered Definition of Ready; rework defects dropped ~40% over two quarters. Living docs, tagged to regulatory controls, became the audit artefact. Automation followed the conversation, not the reverse — and they measured rework, not scenario count.
- **Enterprise mandate, failed rollout.** A VP mandated "Cucumber for all teams." Within a quarter, infra and platform teams (bottom-left) were writing imperative Gherkin for themselves, suites ballooned to 40-minute ice-cream cones, and the dashboard proudly showed "12,000 scenarios" — pure tax dressed as success by a vanity metric. The fix: rescind the mandate, adopt by domain, switch the metric to rework rate.
- **Living docs outliving BDD.** A team's automated suite withered, but the *living documentation* habit stuck: their declarative scenarios remained the canonical, always-green description of behaviour that support and new hires relied on daily — the by-product proving more durable than the original testing motive.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Org-wide Cucumber mandate.** Guarantees the trap at scale: every team pays the tax, bottom-left domains gain nothing.
- **Counting scenarios as success.** The textbook Goodhart failure; rewards volume and the ice-cream cone, misleads leadership.
- **Mandating the artefact, not the conversation.** Produces devs writing Gherkin alone — exactly what BDD exists to prevent.
- **No paved fast path.** Without an in-process/API driver harness, teams default to slow browser scenarios and the pyramid inverts.
- **Letting criteria and scenarios drift apart.** Two sources of truth defeats specification by example; keep examples = criteria = tests.
- **Heavy upfront mapping.** Drifts toward big-design-up-front; keep sessions timeboxed and per-story.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Acceptance & BDD** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Acceptance & BDD?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
