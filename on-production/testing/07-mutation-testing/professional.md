# Mutation Testing — Professional

<!-- level-focus -->
At professional level, focus on this question:

> How should teams adopt and operate **Mutation Testing** with measurable outcomes and limited coordination?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Testing](../README.md) → Mutation Testing
>
> *Rolling mutation testing out across an org: where it earns its keep, gating it without triggering Goodhart, validating suites through refactors, and governing the cost.*

## Core Concept 1 — A Cost-Aware Adoption Policy

Mutation testing is too expensive to apply uniformly. A professional policy answers *where* before *how much*. Tier your codebase by the cost of a missed bug:

```text
Tier A — load-bearing correctness  (pricing, billing, tax, auth, validation,
         core algorithms, state machines)
         → mutation-tested, diff-gated in CI, periodic full-repo baseline.

Tier B — important but lower-risk  (most business services)
         → mutation tested on demand / nightly trend, no hard gate.

Tier C — glue, DTOs, generated, trivial  (getters, mappers, scaffolding)
         → NOT mutation-tested. Coverage + review is enough.
```

The policy lives in config, not in heads. PIT `targetClasses` / `excludedClasses`, Stryker `mutate` globs, gremlins/cargo-mutants path filters — encode the surface area explicitly so the tool never wanders into Tier C and drowns the signal.

The framing for stakeholders: mutation testing is **a correctness audit on your riskiest code**, priced accordingly — not a universal metric. You spend the compute where a survivor would mean lost money, a breach, or data corruption.

## Core Concept 2 — Diff-Based Mutation in CI

The per-PR form is always **diff-scoped**: mutate only the lines this PR changed. This keeps feedback fast and the signal maximally relevant — *"are the lines you just wrote actually tested?"*

```yaml
# PR pipeline (Tier A modules only)
mutation:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npx stryker run --incremental --since=origin/${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH}
  rules:
    - changes: ["src/billing/**", "src/auth/**"]   # only Tier A
```

Equivalent on the JVM with PIT + a git-diff scoping plugin:

```text
$ mvn -P mutation test
[INFO] Analysing 31 mutants across 3 changed files (diff vs origin/main)
[INFO] >> Generated 31 mutations Killed 28 (90%)

  billing/Invoice.java:142  boundary (amount > limit → amount >= limit)  SURVIVED
  billing/Invoice.java:151  removed call to audit.record(...)            SURVIVED
  auth/Policy.java:67       negated conditional                          SURVIVED

[INFO] Diff mutation score: 28/31 = 90.3%  (gate: 85%)  → PASS
```

Design notes:

- **Gate on the diff, report on the repo.** The PR check uses diff score; a dashboard tracks whole-module score over time.
- **Keep it under a few minutes.** Diff-scoping + test selection + parallelism. If a PR's diff is huge, that's a PR-size problem, not a mutation problem.
- **Full-repo runs go nightly/weekly,** parallelized, with history enabled, feeding the trend — never on the PR critical path.

## Core Concept 3 — Mutation Score as a Gate, and the Goodhart Trap

A mutation-score gate is powerful and dangerous. Powerful: it's far harder to game than coverage — you can't pass it with assertion-free tests. Dangerous: *any* hard numeric gate invites the behaviors that satisfy the number instead of the intent. This is **Goodhart's law**, and it's covered in depth in [Engineering Metrics & DORA](../../engineering-metrics-and-dora/).

How a mutation gate gets gamed:

```text
- Suppress survivors wholesale (mark "equivalent" without checking).
- Write tautological tests that assert the implementation back to itself.
- Narrow the mutated surface to easy code until the number looks good.
- Add asserts that technically kill a mutant but encode no real spec.
```

Guardrails that keep the gate honest:

1. **Gate on the diff, not absolute repo score.** "New code must be 85% mutation-tested" is a *quality-of-new-work* contract; a global "repo must be 90%" target rewards gaming.
2. **Make suppressions reviewable.** Every `// pitest:skip` / `// Stryker disable` requires a reason and shows up in code review as a deliberate decision, not a silent escape hatch. Track a **suppression budget** — a sudden spike is a smell.
3. **Set the threshold from observed baseline, not aspiration.** Measure where good modules already are; gate slightly below that. A threshold teams can't hit honestly will be defeated dishonestly.
4. **Pair the gate with code review.** The reviewer, not the number, judges whether a killed mutant reflects a real assertion. The score routes attention; humans judge.
5. **Prefer "no new survivors" over "hit 90%."** Framing the gate as *don't regress on changed lines* is more robust than a fixed target.

The honest summary: use the score to **start conversations and route review attention**, and gate the *diff* lightly. The moment leadership turns a global mutation score into an OKR, you've created an incentive to lie to the tool.

## Core Concept 4 — Validating a Suite During a Refactor

This is one of mutation testing's highest-value uses, and it's a *professional* move because it changes how you de-risk large changes.

A refactor's entire safety argument is "the tests will catch a behavior change." But coverage can't tell you whether the tests *would*. Mutation testing can. The workflow:

```text
1. BEFORE touching the code, mutation-test the existing suite on the module.
   → This is the real strength of your safety net, in a number + survivor list.

2. If the score is low, the suite is NOT a safe net.
   → Strengthen tests (kill the survivors) FIRST, on the unchanged code.

3. Now refactor. The suite — proven to pin behavior — guards the change.

4. Re-run mutation testing after. Score should hold; survivors should be
   the same equivalents you triaged before, not new holes.
```

The key insight: you must validate the suite **before** you change the code, on the *original* behavior. A green test run on a refactored codebase only proves the tests pass — not that they'd have failed on a regression. Mutation testing on the pre-refactor suite is what converts "we have tests" into "we have a net that holds." This pairs directly with characterization tests and the *working-with-legacy-code* discipline.

---

## Core Concept 5 — Auditing Legacy Tests

Inherited a service with 92% coverage and no idea whether the tests are real? Mutation testing is the audit.

Run it (scoped to the critical modules) and the survivor list is an inventory of false confidence:

```text
$ pitest report (legacy OrderService, scoped run)
  Line coverage:    92%
  Mutation score:   41%
  Test strength:    44%   (low even over covered code)

  Top survivor clusters:
   - 23 mutants in TaxCalculator      → tests assert "total > 0", never the rate
   - 17 mutants in DiscountEngine     → no boundary tests at all
   -  9 removed-void-call mutants     → side effects (audit, email) unverified
```

A 92% coverage / 41% mutation score gap is the quantified statement *"most of this suite asserts nothing meaningful."* That's an actionable audit: you now know precisely which modules' tests to invest in, ranked by survivor density, instead of "the tests feel weak." Feed it into your [Technical Debt](../../technical-debt-management/) backlog if that section exists in your tree.

## Core Concept 6 — Org Rollout and Cost Governance

Rolling mutation testing across many teams is a change-management problem as much as a technical one. A workable sequence:

```text
1. PILOT   — one team, one Tier-A module. Prove value (find real holes),
             measure CI cost, tune operator set + thresholds.
2. PATTERN — package the config: shared CI template, agreed thresholds,
             suppression conventions, the "Tier A/B/C" surface policy.
3. EXPAND  — opt-in per team, Tier-A modules first. Diff-gate new code.
4. NORMALIZE — nightly full-repo trend dashboards; review suppression budgets;
             mutation score becomes a *signal in review*, never an OKR.
```

**Cost governance** is explicit, because the runs cost real compute:

- **Bound the surface** (Tier A only) so mutant counts stay sane.
- **Diff-scope per PR; full-run nightly** — keep the expensive job off the critical path.
- **Parallelize the nightly run** across shards; cap parallelism to your CI budget.
- **Sample huge legacy modules** for trend-only tracking rather than full runs.
- **Track CI minutes spent on mutation** as a line item; if it spikes, re-scope.

Cultural framing matters most: present mutation testing as **a tool that finds where your tests lie**, owned by engineers, not as a management dashboard. The fastest way to kill adoption is to weaponize the score in performance reviews — that guarantees gaming and resentment.

## Core Concept 7 — Mutation Testing in the Quality System

Mutation testing isn't standalone; it's the **sufficiency check** that sits above the rest of your quality stack:

```text
Coverage        → did the line run?            (necessary floor)
Mutation        → would a test fail if wrong?  (sufficiency on Tier A)
Property-based   → do invariants hold widely?   (mutation grades their strength)
Code review      → is the assertion meaningful? (human judgment on survivors)
Quality gates    → enforce the above on the diff (policy)
```

- vs **[Code Coverage](../../code-coverage/):** coverage is the cheap, broad floor; mutation is the expensive, narrow sufficiency check on top. Run coverage everywhere; run mutation where correctness is load-bearing. Coverage caps the mutation score, so you need both.
- vs **[Property-Based Testing](../06-property-based-testing/):** PBT widens input space; mutation validates that the properties are strong enough to catch faults. They compound.
- vs **[Engineering Metrics & DORA](../../engineering-metrics-and-dora/):** mutation score is a *team-owned diagnostic*, not a delivery metric. Keep it out of cross-team leaderboards to avoid Goodhart.

Use the **`unit-testing-patterns`** skill to standardize the assertion patterns that kill mutants across teams — a shared vocabulary of "assert the value, the boundary, the side effect" makes the gate teachable rather than punitive.

## Real-World Examples

**The payments org.** Tier-A modules (`billing/`, `pricing/`, `tax/`) are diff-gated at 85% mutation score on changed lines; everything else uses coverage + review. Nightly full-repo PIT runs across 16 shards in ~22 minutes feed a trend dashboard. Suppressions require a reviewer-approved reason. In year one, the diff gate caught dozens of boundary survivors in new pricing rules that coverage had blessed as 100%.

**The refactor that didn't blow up.** Before splitting a monolithic `RiskEngine`, the team mutation-tested the suite: 52%. They spent a sprint killing survivors (to 84%) *on the unchanged engine*, then refactored. Two genuine regressions were caught by tests that, pre-strengthening, would have stayed green. Mutation testing paid for itself in one refactor.

**The gamed gate (anti-pattern).** A different org mandated a global 90% mutation score as a quarterly target. Teams hit it by suppressing survivors en masse and writing tautological tests. The number looked great; a production billing bug shipped through a suppressed mutant. They moved to a diff-only gate with reviewed suppressions — the textbook Goodhart correction.

## Common Mistakes

- **A global mutation-score OKR.** Guarantees gaming. Gate the diff; keep the global number a trend.
- **Running it on the whole repo, per PR.** CI grinds, teams disable it. Tier the surface; diff-scope; nightly full-run.
- **Unreviewed suppressions.** A growing pile of `disable` comments silently hides the holes the gate exists to find.
- **Trusting a green suite for a refactor.** Green proves tests pass, not that they'd catch a regression — mutation-test *first*.
- **Weaponizing the score in performance review.** Fastest possible way to destroy adoption and trust.
- **Setting the threshold by aspiration.** A gate teams can't pass honestly gets defeated dishonestly. Baseline first.
- **Skipping cost governance.** Mutation runs are pricey; un-scoped, they become a budget problem nobody owns.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Mutation Testing** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Mutation Testing?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
