# Rollback & Roll-Forward — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Rollback & Roll-Forward** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Release Engineering](../README.md) → Rollback & Roll-Forward

*Recovery has a toolbox. Know each mechanism's speed and risk, treat the database as the hard part, and turn hotfixes into a procedure rather than a scramble.*

## Core Concept 1 — Rollback mechanisms ranked by speed and risk

Not all rollbacks are equal. Rank them from fastest/safest to slowest/riskiest, and **reach for the top of the list first**:

| # | Mechanism | Recovery time | Notes |
|---|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | **Feature-flag kill switch** | Seconds, **no deploy** | Best when the bad change is behind a flag. Config change only. |
| 2 | **Traffic shift / blue-green swap** | Seconds–minutes | Point the LB/mesh back at the old version that's still running warm. |
| 3 | **Redeploy previous artifact** | Minutes | `rollout undo` / `helm rollback` to the *exact* prior image. |
| 4 | **Revert commit + rebuild** | Tens of minutes, **risky** | New, untested artifact. Last resort. |

**1 — Kill switch.**
- If the broken feature is behind a flag, you don't roll back anything; you flip the flag off.
- No pods restart, no traffic moves.
- Progressive delivery and rollback are deeply linked — see [Feature Flags & Progressive Delivery](../06-feature-flags-and-progressive-delivery/middle.md).

```bash
# Conceptual: flip a flag off (LaunchDarkly/Unleash/OpenFeature backend)
curl -X PATCH https://flags.internal/api/flags/new-checkout \
  -d '{"enabled": false}'
# Effect is global within seconds. No deployment occurred.
```

**2 — Traffic shift / blue-green.**
- If you deployed green alongside still-running blue, recovery is just repointing the router.

```bash
# Blue-green via a Kubernetes Service selector swap
kubectl patch service checkout -p \
  '{"spec":{"selector":{"version":"blue"}}}'   # instant cutback to blue
```

**3 — Redeploy previous artifact.**
- The workhorse. Deploy the known-good image by tag/digest:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/checkout --to-revision=4
helm rollback checkout 7        # to a specific Helm revision
```

**4 — Revert + rebuild.**
- Only when no prior artifact exists, or the fix genuinely belongs in source and you've decided to roll *forward*.
- The slowest, and the only one that ships something production has never seen.

> **The mantra: roll back the *binary*, not the *source*.** Mechanisms 1–3 reuse proven artifacts/state. Mechanism 4 builds a new one — that's roll-forward in disguise.

## Core Concept 2 — The data problem and expand/contract migrations

- Code rolls back in seconds. **Databases do not.**
- A schema migration is, by default, a one-way door.
- If it removed something the old code reads, rolling the code back lands it in a database it cannot operate. This is *the* reason rollbacks fail.

The fix:

- Make every schema change **backward-compatible** so *both* the old and new code work against *every* intermediate schema.
- The pattern is **expand/contract** (Fowler calls it **parallel change**).
- Instead of one destructive step, split the change into reversible phases spread across multiple releases.

### Worked example: renaming `full_name` → `name`

**The wrong way (one destructive migration, coupled to the deploy):**

```sql
-- Ships with the feature deploy. Now rollback is impossible.
ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN full_name TO name;
```

**The right way — expand/contract across releases:**

```sql
-- Release 1: EXPAND. Add the new column. Old code untouched.
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN name TEXT;

-- Backfill existing rows (batched, online).
UPDATE users SET name = full_name WHERE name IS NULL;

-- Keep both in sync during the transition (trigger or dual-write in app code).
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_name() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.name := COALESCE(NEW.name, NEW.full_name);
  NEW.full_name := COALESCE(NEW.full_name, NEW.name);
  RETURN NEW;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
CREATE TRIGGER trg_sync_name BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_name();
```

```text
Release 2: MIGRATE CODE. Application reads/writes `name`.
           Old `full_name` still present and in sync.
           --> Rollback to Release-1 code is SAFE: it reads full_name, still there.

Release 3: CONTRACT. Only after Release 2 is proven stable, drop the old column.
```

```sql
-- Release 3: CONTRACT. Now, and only now, it is safe.
DROP TRIGGER trg_sync_name ON users;
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN full_name;
```

- At every step, the previous version of the code can still run.
- **Rollback is preserved because the schema is forward-only and backward-compatible.**
- The `database-migration-patterns` skill covers backfill batching, dual-writes, and contract timing in depth.

---

## Core Concept 3 — Never couple a schema change to the deploy that uses it

- The most common way teams destroy their own rollback path is bundling a schema change *into the same deploy* as the code that depends on it.
- That deploy becomes atomic in the wrong way: you can't undo the code without undoing the schema, and you can't undo the schema because it deleted data.

**Decouple migrations from deploys:**

- Run **expand** migrations *before* the code that needs them, as a separate, idempotent step.
- Ship code that works against **both** the old and new schema (tolerant reader).
- Run **contract** migrations *after* the new code is stable, as a *later* release — never in the rollback window.

```yaml
# Pipeline ordering (conceptual)
stages:
  - migrate-expand     # additive only; safe to re-run; safe under old code
  - deploy-code        # rollback-able on its own
  - soak               # bake time; watch SLOs
  - migrate-contract   # destructive; gated behind "previous release is permanent"
```

- A migration in the expand phase must be **idempotent** (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, guarded backfills) so re-running it during a chaotic rollout never corrupts state.

---

## Core Concept 4 — Hotfix policy: roll-forward as a procedure

- When you *must* roll forward (a destructive change shipped, or only a small fix is appropriate), do it as a disciplined procedure, not a hero scramble.
- A hotfix is roll-forward formalized.

**The standard hotfix flow:**

```bash
# 1. Branch from the EXACT release tag that's in production — not from main.
git checkout -b hotfix/checkout-500 v2.4.0

# 2. Make the MINIMAL change. One bug. No refactors, no extras.
#    (edit, test the specific path)

# 3. Tag and build the hotfix artifact.
git commit -am "fix: null guard in checkout total"
git tag v2.4.1
#    CI builds v2.4.1 from this tag through an EXPEDITED gate
#    (critical tests + security scan, not the full multi-hour suite).

# 4. Deploy v2.4.1 (this is the roll-forward).

# 5. Merge the fix BACK to main so it isn't lost on the next release.
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <hotfix-commit-sha>
```

- **Why branch from the tag, not `main`?** `main` may already contain unreleased changes you do *not* want in production. Branching from the release tag guarantees the hotfix contains *only* the in-production code plus your one fix. See [Release Branching & Trains](../03-release-branching-and-trains/middle.md).
- **The expedited gate** is a deliberately narrowed quality gate: run the critical correctness and security checks, skip the slow, low-risk parts so recovery isn't blocked for an hour.
- **Never skip *all* gates** — an unverified hotfix can make the incident worse.

## Core Concept 5 — The rollback decision tree

```
Incident: current release is bad.
│
├─ Is the bad change behind a feature flag?
│     └─ YES → flip the kill switch (seconds). DONE.
│
├─ Did this release run a DESTRUCTIVE migration?
│     ├─ YES → you CANNOT safely roll back the code.
│     │         → ROLL FORWARD (hotfix).
│     └─ NO  → continue.
│
├─ Is a known-good previous artifact available & warm (blue-green)?
│     └─ YES → traffic shift / blue-green swap (seconds). DONE.
│
├─ Is a known-good previous artifact in the registry?
│     └─ YES → redeploy it (rollout undo / helm rollback). DONE.
│
└─ None of the above → revert + rebuild (slow) OR roll forward.
```

The tree is ordered by speed and safety. You only descend when the faster option isn't available.

## Core Concept 6 — Mixed-version fleets: N and N-1 must interoperate

- During any rollout *or* rollback, you transiently run **two versions at once**: some pods on N, some on N-1.
- If those two versions can't coexist, your rollback (and your rollout) will break mid-flight.

Concretely, N and N-1 must agree on:

- **Database schema** — guaranteed by expand/contract (both versions tolerate the same schema).
- **API/contract compatibility** — N-1 must accept requests/responses produced by N and vice versa. Don't remove a field N-1 still sends; don't require a field N-1 doesn't send.
- **Message/event schema** — a consumer on N-1 must still parse messages produced by N (use additive, versioned schemas; tolerant readers).

```text
Rolling rollback in progress:
  [pod: N-1] [pod: N-1] [pod: N]  ← all hitting the same DB and queue
  Every pair must interoperate, or requests fail non-deterministically.
```

- The practical rule: **every release must be compatible with the one immediately before it.**
- This compatibility window is what *makes* rollback safe — without it, a rollback is just a different way to cause an outage.
- The `high-availability-patterns` skill discusses designing for mixed-version operation.

---

## Real-World Examples

- **Flag save.** A new recommendation engine tanks conversion. Because it shipped behind a flag at 10% rollout, the team flips it off in 5 seconds — no deploy, no rollback. The bad code is still on the boxes, just dormant.
- **Expand/contract pays off.** A team renames a column via expand/contract over three releases. A bug surfaces in the release that switched reads to the new column. They roll the code back one revision; because the old column is still present and synced, the old code runs perfectly. Rollback worked *because* the migration was non-destructive.
- **Coupled migration disaster.** A team drops `legacy_token` in the same deploy that stops using it. A separate, unrelated bug in that deploy forces a rollback — but the old code authenticates against `legacy_token`, now gone. They can't roll back and must scramble a hotfix while logins fail. The root cause wasn't the bug; it was *coupling a destructive migration to the deploy.*

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Reaching for `rollout undo` when a kill switch would do.** If it's behind a flag, flip the flag — it's faster and touches nothing.
- **Destructive migrations in the release window.** `DROP`/`RENAME` belongs in a *later* contract release, never coupled to the feature deploy.
- **Branching the hotfix from `main`.** You'll smuggle unreleased changes into production. Branch from the release tag.
- **Forgetting to cherry-pick back.** The next release re-introduces the bug you just hotfixed.
- **Assuming versions interoperate.** Removing an API field or changing a message schema breaks the mixed-version window during rollout *and* rollback.
- **Non-idempotent expand migrations.** A re-run during a messy rollout corrupts data; guard everything with `IF NOT EXISTS`.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Rollback & Roll-Forward** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Rollback & Roll-Forward?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
- How would you rank rollback mechanisms by speed and risk, and when would you reach for each one?
- Why should a hotfix branch from the release tag rather than `main`?
- How would you implement expand/contract in SQL to rename a column safely?
- Why must a destructive schema change never be coupled to the deploy that uses it?
- What must N and N-1 agree on to interoperate safely during a mixed-version rollout?
