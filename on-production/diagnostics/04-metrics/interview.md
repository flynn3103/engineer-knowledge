## Introduction

Metrics interviews split into two flavours. The first is "do you know the model" — can you name the four instrument types, explain a counter vs a gauge, read a `histogram_quantile` query, recite the golden signals. That's table stakes and a junior is expected to clear it. The second is "do you understand the *economics and the lies*" — why one careless label OOM-kills a Prometheus server, why you cannot average two p99s, why a fast flood of `500`s makes your latency dashboard look *better*, and where the boundary between a metric and a trace actually sits. Senior and staff interviews live almost entirely in the second flavour.

This file is the question bank, graduated junior → staff. Trap questions also explain *why* the obvious instinct is wrong, because in production the wrong instinct is the expensive part — and in metrics, "expensive" frequently means "the monitoring system itself is the outage." The scenario section is where staff candidates earn their title: given "the TSDB is melting," can you diagnose under pressure, stop the bleed, and explain the blast radius?

## Conceptual / Foundational

### Q: Name the metric instrument types and when you'd use each.

Four core types, present (under different names) in StatsD, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Micrometer:

- **Counter** — a monotonically increasing cumulative value. Requests served, bytes sent, errors. You never read the raw value; you `rate()` it. Resets to zero on process restart (the query engine handles the reset).
- **Gauge** — a value that goes up *and* down, sampled at read time. Current temperature, queue depth, in-flight requests, memory in use, connection-pool size. Snapshot of "right now."
- **Histogram** — bucketed observations of a distribution: latency, payload size. Emits per-bucket cumulative counters plus `_sum` and `_count`. Lets you compute quantiles **after** the fact and **aggregate across machines**.
- **Summary** — like a histogram but computes selected quantiles (p50/p90/p99) *client-side* and exposes them directly. Cheaper to query, but the quantiles are **not aggregatable** across instances.

The decision: monotonic count → counter; point-in-time level → gauge; distribution you want percentiles of → histogram (almost always over summary). Mention OTel adds an **UpDownCounter** (a delta-reported gauge-like counter) and **exponential histograms**.

**What-if — "I want average latency, isn't a counter of total-time ÷ counter of count enough?"** That gives you the mean, which hides the tail — the exact thing latency SLOs care about. A `sum/count` average can be 40ms while p99 is 4s. Use a histogram.

**What-if — "Why not just use gauges for everything?"** A gauge holds one value, the last sample. For a rate you'd lose every event between scrapes; for a distribution you'd see only the most recent observation. Counters survive between scrapes (cumulative) and histograms preserve the shape.

### Q: Counter vs gauge — give me a case where choosing wrong silently breaks the dashboard.

A counter is cumulative and only goes up; you graph `rate(x[5m])`. A gauge is the instantaneous value; you graph it directly.

Break case: you model "total requests" as a **gauge** that you `set()` to a running total in app code. On restart it resets to 0 — but the query engine doesn't know it's a counter, so `rate()` semantics (which special-case resets) don't apply, and any direct graph shows a cliff to zero that looks like a traffic outage that never happened. Inverse break: you model "current queue depth" as a **counter**; now it can never decrease, so `rate()` of it is meaningless and the raw value is a lie. Pick the type that matches the *physics* of the quantity: does it only ever accumulate (counter) or can it fall (gauge)?

**What-if — "How does Prometheus handle a counter resetting on restart?"** `rate()` and `increase()` detect a decrease in a counter as a reset and assume it dropped to 0 then climbed, summing the pre- and post-reset deltas. That's why you must never `set()` a counter to an arbitrary lower value — you'd fake a reset and inflate the rate.

### Q: What's the difference between a metric, a log, and a trace?

- **Metric** — a pre-aggregated numeric time series, cheap and constant-cost regardless of traffic. Answers *"is something wrong, and roughly where?"* Bounded cardinality is mandatory.
- **Log** — a timestamped event record, often structured. Answers *"what exactly happened in this one case?"* High cardinality is fine; cost scales with volume.
- **Trace** — a causally-linked tree of spans across services for one request. Answers *"where did the time go / where did it fail in this request's path?"* High-cardinality attributes (user ID, request ID) live here legitimately.

The load-bearing consequence: **identity (user ID, request ID, full URL) belongs in logs and traces, never in a metric label** — because metrics are billed by *series count*, and identity is unbounded. Metrics tell you *that* checkout is slow for `eu-west`; traces tell you *which user's* checkout and *why*.

**What-if — "Then why have metrics at all if traces are richer?"** Cost and always-on coverage. Metrics are constant-cost — a counter is the same handful of bytes whether you serve 10 or 10 million requests, so you can keep them on 100% of traffic forever. Traces you sample (often 1%), so they can't reliably catch a 1-in-10,000 error rate; the metric can.

### Q: What are the Four Golden Signals? Where do they come from?

From the Google SRE book — *if you measure only four things about a user-facing system:*

- **Latency** — how long requests take. Crucially, **measure success and error latency separately** (a flood of fast 500s otherwise flatters your p99).
- **Traffic** — demand: requests/sec, transactions/sec.
- **Errors** — rate of failed requests, and the *kind* (5xx, timeout, or the sneaky "200 with an error body").
- **Saturation** — how "full" the system is; the resource nearest its limit. The **leading indicator** — it pages you *before* the customer is hurt, whereas latency and errors mean the customer is *already* hurting.

**What-if — "How do RED and USE relate to the golden signals?"** **RED** (Rate, Errors, Duration — Tom Wilkie) is the golden signals minus saturation, applied per *service*. **USE** (Utilisation, Saturation, Errors — Brendan Gregg) is applied per *resource* (CPU, memory, disk, pool). Golden Signals ≈ RED + saturation, framed for the user-facing layer. You use RED on endpoints and USE on the resources they run on; together they tell you "the service is slow" *and* "because the DB pool is saturated."

### Q: Why measure success latency and error latency separately?

Because a failure path is usually a *different distribution* — often much faster (you reject early) or much slower (you time out). If you mix them, a sudden flood of fast rejections (auth failing, circuit breaker tripping) drags your p99 *down* and the latency dashboard looks *great* while the system is on fire. Splitting by `status_class` (or a `success`/`error` label) keeps the success-path latency honest, which is the number your SLO is actually about.

**What-if — "What about a 200 that's actually an error?"** That's why "error" must be defined semantically, not just by HTTP status. A `200 OK` carrying `{"error": "..."}` in the body is an error your status-based metric misses. Decide what *counts* as an error for your domain and instrument *that*, sometimes with an explicit `outcome` label set in business logic.

---

## Cardinality & Labels

### Q: What is cardinality, and why is it the defining failure mode of metrics?

Cardinality is the count of **distinct label-value combinations** for a metric — and it's a **product**, not a sum. A counter with `method` (5) × `status_class` (5) × `route` (20) × `region` (4) = 2,000 series. Add `user_id` (1,000,000) and it's 2,000,000,000 series.

It's *the* failure mode because a TSDB's cost is driven by **series count, not sample count**. Prometheus keeps an inverted index mapping every label value to its series and holds active series in RAM. A million-user label means a million index entries and a million in-memory series *per metric carrying it*. Push past a few million active series and the server OOM-kills itself — meaning you go blind exactly when you need to see.

**What-if — "Is a histogram free of this?"** No — a histogram is the *worst* offender, because it's one series **per bucket** per label combination, plus `_sum` and `_count`. A 12-bucket histogram across 600 label combos is `12 × 600 + 2×600 = ~8,400` series before you add anything. Histograms are not free; budget them.

### Q: What makes a good label vs a bad one? Give me the test.

A good label has a **small, finite, predictable** value set you could write on a whiteboard: HTTP method, status class, region, queue name, **route template**, customer *tier*. A bad label has an **unbounded or unpredictable** set: user ID, request ID, email, full URL, raw error message, timestamp, raw IP.

The test: *"Can the number of distinct values grow without bound as the system runs (with users, traffic, time, or deploys)?"* If yes — it's not a label, it's a log field.

The fix pattern is **dimension, don't identify**: replace the identity with the *category* it belongs to. `path="/users/42"` → `route="/users/:id"`. `customer_id="cus_8X2k"` → `tier="enterprise"`. `error="dial tcp 10.2.3.4:5432: connection refused"` → `error_type="connection_refused"`. You lose "which one" (go to traces) and keep "which kind" (bounded, cheap, aggregatable).

**What-if — "A label that *looks* bounded but isn't?"** `version="1.2.3-abc123-dirty-2026-06-11"` — a per-build suffix makes it grow with every deploy. Or `host`/`pod` in an autoscaling fleet — dozens of stable pods is fine; hundreds of ephemeral pods per hour is a slow leak, since old pods' series linger until they age out. "Bounded" is about the *value set*, not the *label name*.

**What-if — "Where do I put `customer_id` then, if a PM demands per-customer numbers?"** Logs or traces (as a span attribute — perfectly fine there), or a purpose-built analytics store (a wide-event system like Honeycomb, or a data warehouse). The metric answers "is the fleet healthy?"; the warehouse answers "what did customer X do?"

### Q: A scanner is hitting random URLs — `/aaaa`, `/bbbb`, … — and your `route` label is exploding. What happened and how do you fix it?

The instrumentation is labelling **unmatched** requests by their concrete path instead of by the matched route template. Every junk URL a scanner (or a fuzzer, or a misconfigured client) sends becomes a new `route` value, and the series count climbs without bound — a cardinality bomb driven by *external* traffic you don't control.

Fix: for any request that doesn't match a known route, label it `route="unmatched"` (or `"other"`). More generally, **map free-form / externally-sourced label values through an allow-list**, and bucket anything unknown into `"other"`, capping cardinality at the source.

**What-if — "Why is this one especially dangerous?"** Because the cardinality is driven by an *adversary or accident outside your system*. Internal labels you can reason about; a label fed by raw user input has no ceiling you control. This is also why error-*message* labels are lethal — the message often embeds an IP, a port, or a generated ID.

### Q: How do you control cardinality at the collection layer, after the fact?

When you can't fix the instrumentation immediately, control it at scrape/ingest time:

- **Relabeling / drop rules** (Prometheus `metric_relabel_configs`, OTel Collector processors): drop a runaway label or whole metric before storage. `labeldrop`, `labelmap`, or `drop` actions.
- **Allow-list the labels you keep**; everything else is stripped.
- **Aggregate away** the offending dimension with a recording rule, then drop the raw high-card series.
- **Per-target / per-metric series limits** (`sample_limit`, `label_limit`, `label_value_length_limit` in Prometheus) — a circuit breaker so one bad target can't take down the server.
- In Micrometer: `MeterFilter.maximumAllowableTags(...)` caps tag values per meter; in OTel, a **view** can drop or rename attributes.

**What-if — "Drop the label or aggregate it?"** Drop if the dimension is useless (request ID). Aggregate-then-drop if the *summed* value matters but the breakdown doesn't (you want total request rate, not per-user). Relabeling is the firefighting tool; fixing the instrumentation is the cure.

### Q: How do you put a guardrail on cardinality so the next bomb doesn't surprise you?

Monitor your monitoring. Alert on `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` crossing a budget. Track per-metric series with `topk(10, count by (__name__)({__name__=~".+"}))` and alert when any single metric crosses a threshold (a "cardinality tripwire" exporter). Set `sample_limit`/`label_limit` per scrape target as a hard ceiling. In CI, lint new instrumentation for known-bad label names (`user_id`, `request_id`, `email`, `path`). The principle: a **cardinality budget defined before you need it**, not discovered in the postmortem.

## Naming, Units & Conventions

### Q: Walk me through metric naming conventions and why they're not just style.

Naming is an **API contract** with every tool downstream — Grafana's auto-units, alerting libraries, and Prometheus tooling *parse* these conventions:

- **`snake_case`, lowercase**: `http_request_duration_seconds`.
- **Subsystem prefix**: `db_query_duration_seconds`, `cache_evictions_total` — groups related metrics, avoids collisions.
- **Counters end in `_total`**: `http_requests_total`. Tooling identifies counters by this suffix.
- **Base SI units in the suffix**: `_seconds` (never `_ms`), `_bytes` (never `_kb`), `_ratio` (0–1, never `_percent`). Grafana auto-formats; alert thresholds assume base units.
- **Don't bake label data into the name**: `http_requests_total{method="GET"}`, **not** `http_get_requests_total` — otherwise you can't sum across methods without regex gymnastics.
- **Describe the thing, not the source**: `payment_authorizations_total` survives refactors and reads well on a dashboard.

**What-if — "Why seconds, not milliseconds? Milliseconds are more readable."** Readability is a *display* concern Grafana handles. Storing in base SI units means every duration metric across your fleet is directly comparable and aggregatable — no per-metric unit conversion, no `_ms` here and `_seconds` there breaking a cross-service dashboard. The data stays canonical; the dashboard divides for humans.

**What-if — "I have `latency_ms` in one service and `request_seconds` in another."** You can't build a single fleet dashboard or a shared recording rule over them — every query needs per-service unit handling. This is exactly the cross-service consistency problem; standardise on `_seconds` everywhere.

### Q: Ratios — `_ratio` (0–1) or `_percent` (0–100)?

Store as a unitless ratio in `0..1` with a `_ratio` suffix: `cache_hit_ratio = 0.95`. Percent is a display format Grafana applies; keeping the data unitless means thresholds, math across metrics, and alert expressions stay simple (`> 0.99` reads cleanly). `_percent` invites the classic bug where someone alerts on `> 95` against a metric that's actually `0.95`.

---

## Percentiles, Histograms & Aggregation

### Q: Why can't you average two p99s?

Because a percentile is a property of a **distribution**, and the average of two percentiles is not the percentile of the combined distribution. Server A's p99 might be 100ms and server B's p99 200ms, but the true p99 of *all* requests across both depends on each server's *traffic volume and full shape*, not just their individual p99s. If A served 1M requests and B served 10, the combined p99 is essentially A's. Averaging gives 150ms, which corresponds to no real request anywhere.

The right way: aggregate the **raw distributions**, then compute the percentile once over the merged data. With histograms that's exactly what you do — sum the per-bucket counters across instances, *then* `histogram_quantile`. This is the single biggest reason histograms beat summaries for fleet-wide latency.

**What-if — "So how do summaries break here?"** A summary computes its quantiles **client-side, per instance**. You get `latency{quantile="0.99"}` already cooked per pod. There is no correct way to combine them into a fleet p99 — you'd be averaging p99s, which is exactly the sin above. A summary's quantiles are only valid for the single instance that produced them.

**What-if — "What about p50 — can I average medians?"** Same problem, same answer. No percentile is averageable across distributions. The median is just p50; it inherits the identical flaw.

### Q: How does a histogram let you compute a fleet-wide p99 correctly?

A Prometheus histogram exposes **cumulative per-bucket counters**: `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.1"}`, `{le="0.25"}`, … each counting observations ≤ that bound, plus `_sum` and `_count`. Buckets are additive across instances, so:

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.99,
  sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)
```

`sum by (le)` merges every pod's buckets into one fleet-wide distribution; `histogram_quantile` interpolates the 99th percentile within the bucket that crosses it. Because buckets are just counters, the merge is exact addition — that's what makes histograms aggregatable where summaries are not.

**What-if — "How accurate is `histogram_quantile`?"** As accurate as your bucket boundaries. It assumes a *linear* distribution **within** the bucket that contains the quantile, so the error is bounded by that bucket's width. If p99 falls in a `[1s, 2.5s]` bucket, the answer is somewhere in that 1.5s-wide guess. Tight buckets near your SLO = good estimate; coarse buckets = mush.

### Q: How do you choose histogram bucket boundaries?

Put the **resolution where the decisions are** — densely around your SLO and your typical latency, coarsely in the tail. If your SLO is "p99 < 250ms" and traffic clusters at 5–50ms, you need fine buckets through ~300ms, not the default `{5ms, 10ms, 25ms, 50ms, 100ms, 250ms, 500ms, 1s, 2.5s, 5s, 10s}` if that leaves a 100ms→250ms gap straddling your target.

Common mistakes: buckets too coarse where it matters (all traffic in 1–5ms but the first bucket is 5ms — every quantile pins to the bottom edge and p50 is meaningless); buckets too fine everywhere (cardinality blows up); buckets that don't extend past your real tail (everything beyond the last `le` collapses into `+Inf`, so you can't tell 11s from 110s).

**What-if — "I don't know the distribution in advance."** Use **exponential / native histograms** (Prometheus native histograms, OTel exponential histograms). Buckets are generated on a fixed multiplicative schedule covering many orders of magnitude with bounded relative error and far fewer stored series — no hand-tuning, and you don't have to guess the range up front.

**What-if — "How do I pick buckets for a new service with no data?"** Start with a sensible exponential spread around your SLO, ship, then look at the actual distribution after a week and re-bucket. Or skip the guessing entirely with native/exponential histograms.

### Q: What's the trade-off between a classic histogram and a native/exponential histogram?

Classic histogram: explicit static `le` bounds you choose; one series per bucket, so cost and resolution are *your* fixed decision; widely supported by every Prometheus version and tool. Native/exponential histogram: buckets generated automatically on a multiplicative schedule, dramatically fewer stored series for the same resolution, no manual tuning, bounded *relative* error across the whole range — but newer, needs recent Prometheus/Grafana, and the on-wire/storage format differs. For most latency work today, classic histograms with well-chosen buckets are the safe default; native histograms are where the ecosystem is heading and shine when you can't predict the range.

## Pull vs Push, Collection & OpenTelemetry

### Q: Pull vs push — what's the difference and when do you use each?

**Pull (scrape)**: the monitoring server fetches `/metrics` over HTTP every N seconds. Prometheus is the canonical example. **Push**: your service sends metrics out to a collector or gateway. StatsD, Graphite, and OTLP-push are examples.

Rule of thumb: **pull for long-lived services, push for ephemeral jobs**. A web server lives for weeks — it exposes `/metrics` and lets Prometheus scrape it; a failed scrape *is* a free liveness signal. A 200ms Lambda or a cron job dies before any 15-second scrape could reach it — it pushes (to a Pushgateway or an OTLP collector) and exits.

Pull's bonuses: the scrape itself tells you "is it up?" for free, and the server controls the sampling interval centrally. Pull's cost: service discovery — the server must know every target. Push inverts both: targets need to know the collector, and "is it up?" needs a separate heartbeat (silence is ambiguous — dead, or just idle?).

**What-if — "Prometheus is pull, but I have ephemeral jobs — what do I do?"** Pushgateway for batch jobs (they push their final metrics before exiting; Prometheus scrapes the gateway). But Pushgateway is a *cache* with footguns: it holds the last pushed value forever (stale metrics linger after the job is gone unless you delete them), and it's a single point of aggregation. The modern answer is often an **OTel Collector** receiving OTLP push and re-exposing for scrape, or remote-write.

**What-if — "How does Prometheus do service discovery in Kubernetes?"** It queries the Kubernetes API (`kubernetes_sd_config`) for pods/services/endpoints, then uses relabeling to decide which to scrape (e.g. only pods with a `prometheus.io/scrape: true` annotation) and on which port/path. Targets appear and disappear automatically as pods churn.

### Q: Where does OpenTelemetry fit in the metrics picture?

OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a **vendor-neutral standard** for instrumenting and exporting telemetry — metrics, traces, logs — over a common protocol (**OTLP**). For metrics specifically: you instrument once against the OTel API (Counter, UpDownCounter, Histogram, Gauge, plus async/observable variants), and the OTel SDK exports via OTLP to an **OTel Collector**, which can then fan out to Prometheus, a vendor backend, or several at once.

Key concepts an interviewer probes:
- **Instruments**: Counter, UpDownCounter, Histogram, Gauge, and *observable* (callback-based) versions for values you sample rather than record.
- **Views**: reshape metrics in the SDK — drop attributes (cardinality control), change a histogram's buckets, rename, or filter — without touching instrumentation code.
- **Temporality**: **cumulative** (value since start, what Prometheus expects) vs **delta** (value since last export, what some push backends and StatsD-style systems expect). Mismatched temporality is a classic OTel bug.
- **Exemplars**: attach a sample trace ID to a histogram bucket so you can jump from "this latency bucket spiked" straight to a representative trace.
- **The Collector**: a separate process for receiving, processing (batching, filtering, attribute manipulation, cardinality limiting), and exporting — the place to enforce fleet-wide policy.

**What-if — "Cumulative vs delta temporality — why do I care?"** Prometheus scrape model is cumulative (counters only go up; the query engine computes rates). Delta temporality reports the increment since the last export. If you wire a delta-exporting SDK into a cumulative-expecting backend (or vice versa) without the Collector converting, your rates are wrong or your counters look like they reset every interval. Pick temporality to match the backend.

**What-if — "What are exemplars and why are they powerful?"** An exemplar is a single example observation (with its trace ID and timestamp) attached to a histogram bucket. So when p99 latency jumps, you don't just see *that* it jumped — you click the bucket and land on an actual slow request's trace. It's the bridge from aggregate metric back to a concrete case, without putting high-cardinality IDs in the metric itself.

## Tricky / Trap Questions

### Q: Your latency dashboard shows p99 *improving* during an incident customers are screaming about. What's happening?

Wrong instinct: "the dashboard is wrong, ignore it." The dashboard is reporting exactly what you told it to.

Almost certainly you're measuring latency across **all** requests, success and error mixed. Something is now failing **fast** — auth rejecting early, a circuit breaker tripping, a downstream returning instant 503s — and those fast failures flood the histogram, dragging p99 *down*. The success path may be as slow or slower than before, but it's drowned out.

Fix: split latency by `status_class` (or a `success`/`error` label) and watch the success-path p99. Also watch the error *rate* and *traffic* — a latency drop combined with an error-rate spike is the signature of "fast failures flattering the numbers."

### Q: Someone says "let's add a `customer_id` label temporarily to debug one merchant." What do you say?

Wrong instinct: "sure, it's temporary, we'll remove it." "Temporarily add a high-cardinality label" is how almost every TSDB outage starts, and "temporary" labels are never removed before they OOM the server.

With, say, 40,000 merchants and a 12-bucket histogram across 4 status classes and 3 regions, that one label takes a healthy `~576` series to `12 × 40,000 × 4 × 3 = 5,760,000` series for *one* metric. Prometheus RAM climbs over days, then OOMs and crash-loops on WAL replay — and because the whole fleet shares that Prometheus, **every** team's dashboards and alerts go dark, including the very incident you added the label to debug.

The right move: put `merchant_id` where identity belongs — a **trace attribute** or a log field — and label the metric with `merchant_tier` (bounded) if you need a metric breakdown at all.

### Q: Your p99 from the dashboard says 200ms but users report multi-second page loads. Why might both be true?

Wrong instinct: "the metric is lying." Several legitimate gaps:

- **Wrong percentile for the experience.** p99 means 1 in 100 requests is *worse* than 200ms. A page makes 30 backend calls; the chance *all* dodge the slow 1% is `0.99^30 ≈ 74%` — so ~26% of page loads hit at least one slow call. Tail latency compounds across fan-out.
- **You're measuring server time, not end-to-end.** The histogram times the handler; the user's clock includes DNS, TLS, queueing, network, client render. Measure at the edge/RUM too.
- **Coarse buckets.** If your largest bucket before `+Inf` is 1s, everything from 1s to 60s reads as "≥1s" and `histogram_quantile` can't see the real tail.
- **Averaging across instances** (if it's a summary) — the reported p99 isn't a real p99.

### Q: Your average request latency looks healthy but customers complain about slowness. First check?

Wrong instinct: "latency is fine, must be a client problem." The **average is the wrong statistic**. A mean of 40ms is consistent with 95% of requests at 10ms and 5% at 4s — and the 4s requests are the ones generating complaints. The average is dominated by the bulk and blind to the tail.

First check: look at the **distribution** — p50, p95, p99, p99.9 — from the histogram, not the mean. If you only have a mean (counter-sum ÷ counter-count), that's the actual bug: replace it with a histogram.

### Q: A metric value "looks frozen" — same number every scrape. Is it broken?

Wrong instinct: "the exporter is dead, restart it." Depends on the type:

- A **gauge** legitimately holds steady if the underlying level didn't change (idle queue depth, stable pool size). Not necessarily broken.
- A **counter** that's flat means *no events occurred* in that window (zero traffic) — which might be correct (3am) or a real outage upstream. `rate()` of it is genuinely 0.
- **Truly stale** (the exporter stopped updating): Prometheus marks a series **stale** when a scrape returns but the series is absent, and after `~5min` of failed scrapes. Use the `up` metric and `absent()`/staleness to distinguish "value is 0/flat" from "target is gone."

The check: is `up{job=...}` still 1? Is the `_count` of a histogram advancing? Distinguish "no change" from "no data."

### Q: You alert on `rate(errors_total[1m]) > 0` and get paged constantly. What's wrong?

Wrong instinct: "errors are bad, any error should page." A single transient error in a healthy high-traffic system is normal; paging on `> 0` is alert-fatigue by design.

Fix: alert on an **error *ratio*** over a meaningful window, against an SLO: `rate(errors_total[5m]) / rate(requests_total[5m]) > 0.01` for `5m`. Better still, alert on **burn rate** against an error budget (multi-window: fast burn over 5m AND 1h). Raw error *count* ignores traffic — 10 errors in 10/sec is catastrophic, 10 in 100,000/sec is noise. Ratio and budget make the alert proportional to actual harm.

### Q: Two pods report `http_requests_total` but a `sum()` gives a number that periodically drops. Why?

Wrong instinct: "the counter is broken." Pods **restart**, and a counter resets to 0 on restart. A naive `sum(http_requests_total)` over the raw counters drops every time a pod restarts.

You almost never sum raw counters. Use `sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))` — `rate()` handles each counter's resets correctly *before* summing, so a restart doesn't create a phantom dip. Summing cumulative counters directly is a classic mistake; always rate-then-aggregate.

### Q: Why is `rate()` over a counter sometimes *higher* than the real rate right after a deploy?

Wrong instinct: "the metric is inflated." During a rolling deploy, old pods disappear (their series go stale) and new pods appear with counters starting at 0. `rate()` interpolates over the lookback window and, combined with series churn and extrapolation at the window edges, can briefly over- or under-shoot. Prometheus's `rate()` also *extrapolates* to the window boundaries, which can slightly inflate a sparse series. Use a longer window (`[5m]` over `[1m]`) to smooth deploy churn, and don't over-read a 30-second blip during a rollout.

## System / Design Scenarios

### Q: Your TSDB is melting from cardinality — Prometheus is OOM-crash-looping. Diagnose and stop the bleed, live.

Stop the bleed first, root-cause second.

1. **Confirm it's cardinality, not sample volume.** On a healthy replica (or via the admin API while the primary is down), the head-series count is the tell: `prometheus_tsdb_head_series` is the metric; a sudden step-up is the signature.
2. **Find the culprit metric.** `topk(10, count by (__name__)({__name__=~".+"}))` — the runaway metric usually dwarfs the next by 100×+. Then find the offending *label*: `count(count by (label_you_suspect) (the_metric))`.
3. **Stop ingestion of the bomb.** Add a `metric_relabel_configs` drop rule for that label (or the whole metric), reload config — you don't have to restart-replay. This halts further growth immediately.
4. **Get the server stable.** If it's crash-looping on WAL replay, the dropped label won't help past data; you may need to delete the offending series (`/api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series`) and clean tombstones, or in the worst case wipe the WAL to break the loop, accepting a gap.
5. **Restore the fleet.** Remember the **blast radius**: every tenant sharing this Prometheus was blind. Confirm dashboards/alerts are back.
6. **Root cause and prevent.** Find the commit/label that introduced it (usually an identity label "for debugging"). Replace identity with category; move per-entity debugging to traces. Add a `sample_limit`/`label_limit` per target and a series-count alert so the next one trips a circuit breaker instead of an outage.

**What-if — "How do you prevent a recurrence beyond the alert?"** Per-target ingestion limits as a hard ceiling; CI lint banning `user_id`/`request_id`/`path` label names; a cardinality budget per team; and architecturally, isolate tenants onto separate Prometheus instances (or use a multi-tenant system like Mimir/Cortex with per-tenant series limits) so one team's bomb can't blind everyone.

### Q: Design the metrics for a new payments service.

**Golden signals / RED first, business metrics second.**

- **RED per endpoint** via one middleware: `http_requests_total{method,route,status_class}` (counter), `http_request_duration_seconds{method,route}` (histogram, success vs error split), `http_requests_in_flight` (gauge, saturation). Bounded labels only — route *template*, status *class*.
- **Business metrics**: `payment_authorizations_total{outcome,card_brand,tier}`, `payment_capture_duration_seconds`, dollar volume, success ratio by card brand. Outcome and brand are bounded; **never** `card_number`, `merchant_id`, or `customer_id` as labels.
- **Saturation / USE on resources**: DB pool `db_connections_in_use / db_connections_max`, queue depth, downstream issuer client in-flight.
- **Latency split** success vs error so a flood of declined-card fast-fails can't flatter p99.
- **Histograms** for all latency (aggregatable fleet p99), buckets tuned around the SLO; consider exemplars to jump to a trace.
- **Alerts**: error-budget burn rate (multi-window), p99 > SLO for 5m, saturation leading indicators (pool > 90%, queue depth climbing), downstream issuer error rate. **Not** raw error count.

**What-if — "Where does per-customer / per-merchant analysis live?"** Not the TSDB. `merchant_id` is a trace attribute and a log field; per-merchant aggregates go to a warehouse or wide-event store. Compliance bonus: never put PAN/CVV anywhere near a metric label (or a log) — PCI scope.

### Q: A PM wants a dashboard of per-customer API usage for 200,000 customers. How do you serve it without killing the TSDB?

Not with a metric label — 200,000 series per metric, growing forever, and the dashboard would query 200k series anyway. Options, in order of preference:

1. **Wrong tool for metrics; right tool for a warehouse.** Per-customer usage is an analytics question. Emit usage as **events** (logs / wide events) keyed by `customer_id`, land them in a warehouse (BigQuery, ClickHouse, Snowflake), and build the per-customer dashboard there. That's what those systems are *for*.
2. **Bounded metric for fleet health + drill-down elsewhere.** Keep the metric labelled by `tier`/`plan` (bounded) for "is the fleet healthy?", and link to the warehouse/traces for "what did customer X do?".
3. **If it must be near-real-time per customer**, a streaming aggregation (Flink/Kafka Streams) or a purpose-built usage-metering service — not Prometheus.

The principle: metrics answer "is *the system* healthy?" with bounded cardinality; per-entity analytics is a different system with different economics.

### Q: Your metrics bill (or TSDB storage) is exploding. How do you cut cost without going blind?

Cost in metrics is dominated by **series count** and **retention × resolution**. Attack in that order:

1. **Find the high-cardinality offenders** (`topk` by series per metric) and fix or drop their runaway labels — usually 80% of the cost is a few metrics.
2. **Drop labels nobody queries.** Audit dashboards/alerts for which labels are actually used; relabel-drop the rest.
3. **Reduce resolution / retention by tier.** Keep raw high-resolution data for days, **downsample** to coarser resolution for long-term (recording rules, or Thanos/Mimir downsampling). You rarely need 15s resolution for data 6 months old.
4. **Recording rules** for expensive, frequently-queried aggregations — compute once, store the small result, drop the need to keep raw high-card series hot.
5. **Sampling for traces, not metrics.** Metrics are constant-cost per series; don't "sample" them — control cardinality instead. (Sampling belongs to traces.)

**What-if — "Can I just sample metrics to cut cost?"** Sampling a counter or histogram corrupts it — you'd undercount and your rates/quantiles would be wrong. The lever for metrics is **cardinality and retention**, not sampling. Sampling is a *trace* cost lever.

### Q: Design alerting that doesn't drown the on-call in noise.

- **Alert on symptoms, not causes.** Page on user-facing SLO violations (error budget burn, latency SLO breach), not on every CPU spike. Cause-level signals go on dashboards, not pagers.
- **SLO-based burn-rate alerts, multi-window.** Page fast when burning the budget fast (e.g. 2% of monthly budget in 1h *and* still burning over 5m); ticket (not page) for slow burns.
- **Ratios and durations, never raw counts or instantaneous spikes.** `for: 5m` to ride out blips.
- **Saturation as the leading page** so you act before customers are hurt.
- **Severity tiers**: page for "users affected now," ticket for "will be affected soon," dashboard for "good to know."

**What-if — "Why burn rate over a static threshold?"** A static `error_rate > 1%` either pages on a harmless 2-minute blip or is too slow to catch a fast catastrophic burn. Burn-rate alerting ties the page to **how fast you're consuming the error budget**, which is proportional to actual customer harm — fewer false pages, faster real ones.

## Whiteboard / Live Exercises

### Q: Compute the series count. `method`(5), `route`(40), `status_class`(5), `region`(3) on a histogram with 12 buckets. Then someone adds `user_id`(100,000).

Histogram series = (label combinations) × (buckets + 2) for `_bucket` per `le`, plus `_sum` and `_count`.

```
label combos = 5 × 40 × 5 × 3 = 3,000
buckets contribute 12 _bucket series each, + _sum + _count = 14 series per combo
total = 3,000 × 14 = 42,000 series        ← healthy
```

Add `user_id` (100,000):

```
3,000 × 100,000 = 300,000,000 combos × 14 = 4,200,000,000 series   💥
```

What breaks: TSDB index and RAM explode (series, not samples, drive memory), Prometheus OOMs and crash-loops on WAL replay, and **every** tenant sharing that server goes blind. Fix: drop `user_id`; if you need a metric slice, use `tier` (bounded); put `user_id` in traces.

### Q: Here's a query — read it and tell me what it computes and whether it's correct.

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

It computes the 99th-percentile request latency over the last 5 minutes — **but it's subtly wrong if this metric has multiple series** (per pod, per route), because it computes a *per-series* p99 and you almost never want that. To get a fleet-wide p99 you must aggregate buckets *before* the quantile:

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.99,
  sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
)
```

`sum by (le)` merges all instances' buckets into one distribution; then the quantile is computed once over the whole thing. Add other grouping labels (`route`) if you want per-route p99: `sum by (le, route) (...)`. Talking point: this is the "you can't average p99s" rule expressed in PromQL — aggregate the raw buckets, *then* take the percentile.

### Q: Fix the labels on this instrumentation.

```python
REQUESTS.labels(
    path=request.path,                    # "/users/42/orders/98"
    error=str(exc),                       # "timeout connecting to 10.0.0.5:5432"
    customer=request.customer_id,         # "cus_8Kd2"
    status=str(response.status_code),     # "503"
).inc()
```

Every label here is a cardinality bomb except (arguably) status:

```python
REQUESTS.labels(
    route=request.url_rule,               # "/users/:id/orders/:id"  (template)
    error_type=classify(exc),             # "upstream_timeout"       (bounded set)
    tier=customer.tier,                   # "enterprise"             (bounded)
    status_class=f"{response.status_code // 100}xx",  # "5xx"        (5 values)
).inc()
```

Talking points: `path` → route **template**; raw exception string (embeds IP/port) → bounded `error_type` from a classifier; `customer_id` → `tier` (identity → category; the ID goes to a trace); raw status code (60 values) → `status_class` (5 values, and what error-rate alerts query). Net series drop is many orders of magnitude.

### Q: This service exposes `request_latency_ms` as a gauge set to the last request's duration. What's wrong and how do you fix it?

Two bugs. (1) **Wrong unit** — `_ms` instead of base SI `_seconds`, fighting Grafana auto-format and any cross-service comparison. (2) **Wrong type** — a gauge holds *one* value (the most recent request), so it's blind to the distribution; you can never compute p50/p95/p99, and you see whatever the last request happened to be. A burst of slow requests between scrapes is invisible.

Fix: make it a **histogram** named `request_duration_seconds`, observing each request's duration in seconds:

```python
DURATION = Histogram(
    "http_request_duration_seconds",
    "Request latency in seconds.",
    ["route", "method"],
    buckets=[0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10],
)
DURATION.labels(route, method).observe(elapsed_seconds)
```

Now p99 across the fleet is `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (le) (rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])))`.

### Q: Write the minimal RED instrumentation for one HTTP handler. Talk me through the label choices.

```go
var (
    reqs = promauto.NewCounterVec(prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "http_requests_total",
        Help: "HTTP requests by method, route, status class.",
    }, []string{"method", "route", "status_class"})

    dur = promauto.NewHistogramVec(prometheus.HistogramOpts{
        Name: "http_request_duration_seconds",
        Help: "Request latency by method and route.",
        Buckets: prometheus.DefBuckets,
    }, []string{"method", "route"})

    inFlight = promauto.NewGauge(prometheus.GaugeOpts{
        Name: "http_requests_in_flight",
        Help: "In-flight requests (saturation).",
    })
)

func Instrument(route string, next http.HandlerFunc) http.HandlerFunc {
    return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        inFlight.Inc()
        defer inFlight.Dec()
        rec := &statusRecorder{ResponseWriter: w, code: 200}
        start := time.Now()
        next(rec, r)
        cls := strconv.Itoa(rec.code/100) + "xx" // "2xx".."5xx"
        reqs.WithLabelValues(r.Method, route, cls).Inc()
        dur.WithLabelValues(r.Method, route).Observe(time.Since(start).Seconds())
    }
}
```

Choices: **`route` is the template** passed in (`/users/:id`), never `r.URL.Path` (bomb). **`status_class`** (5 values) not the raw code (60) — and it's what alerts query. Counter `_total` gives Rate and (via the class) Errors; histogram `_seconds` gives Duration; the gauge gives Saturation. That's all of RED + saturation from one wrapper, bounded by construction. Talking point: the `defer inFlight.Dec()` and recording on the way out mean panics and early returns are still measured.

## Behavioral / Experience

### Q: Tell me about a time a metric (or its absence) caused or prolonged an incident.

The interviewer wants arc, evidence, surprise, lesson — not "I love observability."

Example skeleton:

- **Symptom.** Checkout error rate climbing, but the dashboard had 40 bespoke business metrics and *not one* showed the 5xx rate — RED was never instrumented.
- **Wrong first move.** Team chased the business metrics, suspecting a pricing bug.
- **Investigation.** Pulled raw access logs, computed the error rate by hand, saw it was upstream payment timeouts — invisible because there was no error-rate metric and no latency split.
- **Resolution.** Added a RED middleware (rate/errors/duration, status split) fleet-wide; the next occurrence paged in 90 seconds.
- **Lesson.** Instrument the *standard* signals before the clever ones. Bespoke metrics are second, not first.

Tell *one* incident, with concrete numbers.

### Q: Describe a cardinality incident you were involved in.

Pick a specific story where series count — not sample volume — was the killer. Important elements: the label that did it (almost always an identity "added to debug"), the blast radius (every tenant of the shared TSDB went blind), and the fix (identity → category, move per-entity debugging to traces, add a series-count alert + per-target limit). Bonus if you mention the diagnosis query (`topk` by series per metric on a healthy replica) and that you added a tripwire afterwards so the next one trips a limit instead of an outage.

### Q: Tell me about a time you removed or simplified metrics rather than adding them.

Shows maturity — most engineers only ever add. Example: "We had three overlapping latency metrics — a summary, a gauge of last-duration, and a histogram — emitted by different generations of code. The summary made fleet p99 impossible to compute, the gauge was noise, and the histogram was the only correct one. I deprecated the first two, migrated dashboards to the histogram, and cut series count and confusion at once. Lesson: a metric you can't aggregate correctly is worse than no metric, because it gives false confidence."

### Q: When did a metric mislead you, and what did you learn?

"Average latency was flat and healthy through a customer-reported slowdown. I trusted the average for two days before someone asked for p99 — which was 6× the mean. The 95% fast requests masked a slow 5%. I'd been watching the one statistic that's blind to the tail. Now the first latency panel on every dashboard is a percentile distribution, never a mean, and 'show me the average' is a yellow flag in design reviews."

### Q: Tell me about standardising metrics across a fleet or team.

Shows you can drive consistency, not just instrument one service. "Two teams emitted the same concept as `latency_ms` and `request_seconds` with different label sets — no cross-service dashboard was possible and shared recording rules broke. I wrote a thin instrumentation library (RED middleware, base-SI units, fixed label set: method/route/status_class) that teams adopted, plus a CI lint banning `_ms` suffixes and identity-shaped label names. Lesson: naming and label sets are an API; consistency has to be *enforced*, not requested."

## What I'd Ask a Candidate Now

Questions that separate "knows the model" from "has run metrics in anger."

### Q: How do you decide whether a new dimension belongs in a metric label, a log field, or a trace attribute?

Listening for the bounded-value-set test, not a vibe. Strong answer: "If the value set is small, finite, and can't grow with users/traffic/time/deploys — label. If it's identity or unbounded but I want it per-case — log field or trace attribute. The deciding question is always 'can this grow without limit?' If yes, it never touches a metric label." Bonus: knowing that the *same* `user_id` that's lethal as a label is perfectly fine as a trace attribute.

### Q: Why can't you average percentiles, and how do you compute a fleet p99 correctly?

The single best discriminator for senior metrics knowledge. Strong answer states that a percentile is a property of a distribution, the average of percentiles corresponds to no real request, and the only correct path is to aggregate the raw distributions (sum histogram buckets across instances) *then* take the quantile. A candidate who shrugs and says "just average them" hasn't run latency at scale.

### Q: When would you reach for a summary over a histogram, if ever?

Mostly a trap — the right answer is "almost never for anything you aggregate." Acceptable: a single-instance, non-aggregated quantile where you want exact client-side percentiles and don't care about fleet roll-up, or where bucket cardinality is genuinely prohibitive. A candidate who reaches for summaries by default, or doesn't know they're un-aggregatable, reveals the gap.

### Q: Your dashboard and your customers disagree about whether the service is healthy. Walk me through reconciling them.

Black-box-meets-instrumentation thinking. Listening for: check what the metric actually measures (server time vs end-to-end), check the percentile (p99 ≠ p99.9 ≠ tail of a fan-out), check success/error split, check bucket resolution, add RUM/edge measurement. The candidate who says "the metric must be right, it's the customer's network" is the wrong hire.

### Q: How do you keep metrics cost under control as a system grows?

Reveals operational maturity. Good answers: series-count budgets and alerts, per-target ingestion limits, cardinality lint in CI, downsampling for long-term retention, recording rules for hot aggregations, and the discipline that metrics cost is cardinality × retention (not sampling — that's for traces). Bad sign: "we'd just buy more Prometheus RAM."

### Q: What's a metric anti-pattern you see constantly, and how do you push back on it?

Self-aware, opinionated answer expected: "Averages on the dashboard," "raw status code as a label," "label data baked into the metric name," "alerting on raw error count," "a `user_id` label 'temporarily'." The push-back matters more than the list — how do you teach the team without being the metrics police?
