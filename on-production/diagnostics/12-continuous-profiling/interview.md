## Introduction

Profiling interviews split into two flavours. The first is "do you know the model" — can you say what a profile *is* (a statistical map of where a resource went, by call stack), name the profile types, read a flame graph without thinking the x-axis is time, run `go tool pprof`, explain why sampling is cheap. That's table stakes and a junior is expected to clear it. The second is "have you run this in anger" — can you tell on-CPU from off-CPU when latency is high and CPU is idle, diff two profiles to catch a deploy regression, correlate a flame graph to a trace via exemplars, roll a profiler out to 5,000 polyglot pods without burning a percent you can't afford, and explain *why* the obvious instinct ("`main` is widest, fix `main`") is wrong. Senior and staff interviews live almost entirely in the second flavour.

This file is the question bank, graduated junior → staff. Trap questions also explain *why* the obvious instinct is wrong, because in production the wrong instinct is the expensive part — in profiling, "expensive" usually means hours optimising a function that was never the bottleneck, or shipping a regression because the deploy gate read the diff backwards. The scenario section is where staff candidates earn their title: given "the profiler itself is now causing latency" or "tie this 14:32 spike to a flame graph," can you reason about overhead budgets, storage, and the pipeline under pressure? Throughout, keep three facts welded down: **flame-graph width is aggregate sample count, not time or order; continuous profiling is statistical sampling, not instrumentation; and a diff/differential profile is a delta — direction matters.**

## Conceptual / Foundational

### Q: What is a profile, and what does "continuous" add?

A **profile is a statistical map of where a program spent a resource** — CPU cycles, allocated bytes, blocked time — attributed to **call stacks**. It's built by **sampling**: a few hundred times a second the profiler interrupts the process, records the current stack, and moves on. After a minute you have tens of thousands of stacks; the function in 30% of them was, statistically, on the CPU ~30% of the time. The profiler does *not* watch every instruction — that would be ruinously expensive.

"Continuous" means running that cheap sampled profiler **permanently on every process in the fleet** and storing the results **time-indexed**, the same way you store metrics. The traditional model is reactive: service is slow → reproduce on a laptop → profile → fix → turn it off. That collapses the moment the bug only happens *in production* — real data distribution, real concurrency, a real contended DB, a cold cache. You can't reproduce it, so the laptop profiler is useless. Continuous profiling means when p99 spikes at 14:32, you don't reproduce anything — you pull the flame graph *for 14:32 in prod*.

**What-if — "Why not just profile on my laptop when something's slow?"** Because the slow path is the one your test workload never hits — a pathological customer payload, a cache that's actually cold, a lock contended at 10× the QPS you tested. A laptop profile of synthetic input profiles a *different program*. Continuous profiling means the evidence already exists when the incident hits; you query history instead of failing to reproduce.

**What-if — "Isn't always-on profiling expensive?"** No — that's the whole point of sampling. A timer-sampled CPU profiler acts only on the tick (~100 Hz), so its cost is bounded by the **sample rate, not your workload**, landing around 1–2% CPU. That's affordable as a permanent tax, which is exactly what makes "profile everything, always" viable rather than a luxury.

### Q: Where does continuous profiling sit relative to logs, metrics, and traces?

It's the **fourth signal of observability**. It doesn't replace the other three; it answers a question they can't:

- **Metric** — "is something slow?" (aggregate number, constant cost, always-on).
- **Trace** — "*which span* / which service was slow?" (one request's path, sampled).
- **Log** — "what exactly happened to this one request?" (one event, scales with volume).
- **Profile** — "*which line of code* burned the resource?" (function/line, aggregated over a window, sampled ~1–2% CPU).

The chain in practice: a **metric** alerts that p99 rose; a **trace** shows the time is inside `checkout-service`; the **profile** for that service at that timestamp shows it's in `json.Marshal` called from `serializeCart` — the actual line to fix. Metrics and traces tell you *where* to look; the profile tells you *what the code was doing*.

**What-if — "If a trace already shows the slow span, why do I need a profile?"** A trace stops at the span boundary — it tells you `checkout-service` took 480ms, not *why*. The span has no idea which function inside it burned the CPU. The profile is the only signal that goes below the span into the code. Trace = "which room"; profile = "which floorboard is on fire."

### Q: Name the profile types and the question each answers.

| Type | Resource | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU / on-CPU** | CPU cycles | "What's burning the processor?" |
| **Off-CPU / wall-clock** | Time spent *blocked* | "Why is it slow while CPU is idle?" |
| **Heap / allocation** | Bytes allocated (or live) | "What's allocating / churning GC / leaking?" |
| **Goroutine / thread** | Count & state of goroutines/threads | "Are goroutines leaking? What are they stuck on?" |
| **Mutex / block (lock contention)** | Time waiting on locks | "Which lock is serialising my concurrency?" |

The decision: hot processor → CPU; slow-but-idle → off-CPU; growing RAM / GC pauses → heap; goroutine count climbing → goroutine; throughput plateau under load → mutex/block. Two distinctions you *must* keep straight: **CPU vs off-CPU** (running vs waiting — a latency bug can live in either) and **heap `alloc` vs `inuse`** (everything ever allocated, for GC pressure, vs what's live right now, for leaks).

**What-if — "A request takes 300ms but the CPU profile is nearly empty. What do you reach for?"** The **off-CPU / wall-clock** profile. The CPU profile is blind to *waiting* — blocked on a DB connection, a lock, a channel, a network call. An empty CPU profile during high latency is the textbook signature that the time is spent off-CPU. This is the single most common foundational trap, and the junior reflex "it's slow, show me the CPU profile" is right exactly half the time.

**What-if — "Allocated vs in-use heap — which for a memory leak?"** `inuse`. A leak is memory that *stays live*, and `inuse` shows live bytes right now. `alloc` includes already-freed bytes and would send you chasing transient allocations — good for GC-pressure hunting, wrong for leaks. Picking the wrong flavour wastes hours.

### Q: How does a sampling profiler actually work?

A CPU sampling profiler:

1. A timer (or a hardware **perf event** like "every N CPU cycles") fires ~100×/s.
2. On each tick it **interrupts** the running thread and **walks the call stack** — reading the chain of return addresses to reconstruct `main → handler → query → scan`.
3. It records that stack as one **sample** and resumes the program.
4. After collection, identical stacks are **aggregated and counted** — `scan` in 3,000 of 10,000 samples means it (and its callers) used ~30% of CPU.
5. Raw addresses are **symbolized** into `package.Function` names using the binary's debug info.

Because it acts only on the tick — not on every call — cost is bounded by the sample rate, giving the ~1–2% overhead. This is **statistical sampling**, and accuracy improves with more samples. Contrast an **instrumenting profiler**, which inserts a timer around every function entry/exit: exact call counts, but 10–100× slowdown — fine for a microbenchmark, impossible in production.

**What-if — "How does an off-CPU profiler differ?"** It works inversely. Instead of sampling who's *on* the CPU, it records the stack at the moment a thread goes to *sleep* (blocks on a syscall, lock, or channel) and how long it stayed asleep — mapping where the program *waited*. It's event-driven on block events rather than timer-driven, which is why its overhead depends on block-event rate, not a fixed sample frequency.

**What-if — "Sampling vs instrumentation — when would you ever instrument?"** Only where you need *exact* counts on a path you control and overhead doesn't matter — a microbenchmark, a focused tracing experiment, a function you're A/B-ing. For anything always-on in production, sampling is the only sane choice. The whole reason continuous profiling exists is that sampling makes "always on" affordable.

### Q: What is symbolization and why does it bite you in production?

Symbolization is turning the **raw memory addresses** in a sampled stack into human-readable `package.Function (file:line)` names, using the binary's **debug info**. The profiler captures addresses cheaply at sample time; mapping them to names needs a symbol table.

It bites in production because prod binaries are often **stripped** of debug info to shrink them — so you get hex addresses, not names, and a flame graph of `0x4f2a10` boxes is useless. The fix is to keep symbols available: either ship symbols with the binary, or (the fleet-scale answer) **upload symbols to a symbol server** so the profiling backend can symbolize *offline* from stripped binaries.

**What-if — "Frame-pointer vs DWARF unwinding — what's the trade-off?"** To walk the stack you need to find each caller's frame. **Frame-pointer unwinding** follows a register chain (`rbp`) — fast and cheap, but only works if the code was compiled *with* frame pointers (often omitted by optimisers for a small speed win). **DWARF (CFI) unwinding** uses richer debug tables to reconstruct frames without frame pointers — works on optimised/stripped-of-FP binaries but is more expensive to compute. eBPF profilers increasingly do DWARF-based unwinding in-kernel precisely so they can profile binaries built without frame pointers, which is most of the real world.

## Flame Graphs & Profile Types

### Q: How do you read a flame graph? What does width mean?

A flame graph (Brendan Gregg) renders a profile as stacked boxes — each box a function, sitting on top of the function that called it. The rules, in order of how often they're gotten wrong:

1. **Width = number of samples containing that frame = share of the resource.** A box twice as wide used twice the CPU/bytes/blocked-time. **Width is NOT time and NOT a count of calls** — it's aggregate sample count.
2. **The x-axis is NOT time and left-to-right order means nothing.** Frames are sorted **alphabetically**, not chronologically. Reading a flame graph like a timeline is the cardinal sin. If you want a timeline, you want a *trace*.
3. **Read top-down for the leaves.** The topmost boxes are the *leaf* functions — the code actually on the CPU when sampled. A wide box at the *bottom* (`main`) just means "a lot happened underneath me." A wide box at the *top* is your target.
4. **Find the widest leaf, optimise from there.** The single widest leaf is the single biggest win.

**What-if — "Flame vs icicle — what's the difference?"** Orientation only, identical data. A **flame** graph grows *up* from the root (`main` at the bottom); an **icicle** graph hangs *down* from the root (`main` at the top). Pyroscope defaults to icicle; classic Brendan-Gregg SVGs are flame. Don't let the flip fool you into thinking the data changed.

**What-if — "Self vs total / flat vs cumulative — explain it."** **Self (flat)** = time in *this function's own code*. **Total (cumulative)** = this function *plus everything it called*. A function with huge total but tiny self isn't the problem — its callees are. You optimise the function with high *self* time, the one actually doing the work. In `go tool pprof`, `top` sorts by self, `top -cum` by cumulative.

### Q: What's a differential (diff) flame graph, and what is it for?

A **differential flame graph** overlays two profiles — typically "before deploy" and "after deploy," or "incident window" vs "baseline" — and colours each frame by the **delta**: frames that **grew are red**, frames that **shrank are blue**, intensity scaling with the size of the change. It's the **killer feature** of continuous profiling: instead of eyeballing two flame graphs side by side, the regression *lights up in red automatically*.

The canonical use is regression detection in a deploy gate: diff the new release's CPU profile against the previous one; if some function went from 5% to 30% of CPU, it's a bright red tower and the gate can fail the deploy. In Go: `go tool pprof -diff_base=old.pb.gz new.pb.gz` (or `-base` for an absolute, non-relative diff).

**What-if — "Which way round is the base, and why does it matter?"** The base is the **reference** you're comparing *against* — in `-diff_base=old new`, `old` is the baseline and `new` is what you're examining, so red means "grew in `new` relative to `old`." Get the direction backwards and your regression shows up as *blue* (an improvement) and a real win shows up as red — you'd ship the regression and revert the fix. Direction is the load-bearing detail of every diff: **a diff is a delta, and a delta has a sign.**

**What-if — "`-base` vs `-diff_base` in pprof?"** `-base` subtracts the base and shows absolute differences (good for "how many more bytes/seconds"); `-diff_base` normalises both profiles first and shows the *relative* shift in composition (good for "what share of the profile moved"). For deploy-regression work where traffic differs between the two windows, `-diff_base` is usually what you want, because raw counts aren't comparable across different traffic volumes.

### Q: How accurate is a profile? When does it lie?

A profile is a **statistical estimate**, not a measurement, so it has noise. A function that ran once for 2ms might not appear at all if no sample landed on it. The fix is *more samples* — longer collection or a higher sample rate — not a different tool. The practical rule: **absence in a profile is weak evidence; presence is strong.** A wide box is almost certainly real; an empty spot might just be undersampled.

Other ways it misleads: **inlining** — the compiler may inline a small hot function into its caller, so it never appears as its own frame (don't conclude "that function isn't called"); a **too-short collection** (a 2-second CPU profile is noise — 30s is a sane default); and **mismatched profile type** (a flat CPU profile during high latency isn't "fast," it's *waiting*).

**What-if — "A function shows huge total time but you can't find where to optimise."** Look at *self*, not total. High total + low self means the cost is in the callees — walk up the tower to the widest *leaf*. Optimising the high-total parent does nothing; the work is happening in a function it calls.

## Tooling & eBPF

### Q: Walk me through the profiling tooling landscape.

- **Go `net/http/pprof` + `go tool pprof`** — the **gold standard** and the reference everyone imitates. One import (`_ "net/http/pprof"`) exposes live CPU/heap/goroutine/mutex/block profiles over HTTP; `go tool pprof -http=:8080 ...` opens the interactive flame graph.
- **The pprof format** — both Go's toolchain *and* the **protobuf profile format** that became the industry **lingua franca**. Pyroscope, Parca, Polar Signals, and others all speak pprof; it's the interchange format the way OTLP is for traces.
- **Continuous-profiling backends** — **Grafana Pyroscope**, **Parca / Polar Signals** (the open continuous-profiling stack), and commercial offerings like **Datadog Continuous Profiler** and **AWS CodeGuru Profiler**. These collect profiles fleet-wide, store them time-indexed, and serve flame graphs and diffs over a time range.
- **eBPF whole-system profilers** — **parca-agent** and **Pyroscope's eBPF mode** profile *any* process in *any* language with **zero instrumentation**, from the kernel.
- **OpenTelemetry profiling signal** — OTel is standardising profiling as the **fourth signal** (with pprof as the interchange format under the hood), so profiles get the same vendor-neutral pipeline as metrics/traces/logs.

**What-if — "Why does everyone converge on the pprof format?"** Because a shared format decouples the *producer* (the language SDK or eBPF agent) from the *backend* (Pyroscope, Parca, a vendor). Any profiler that emits pprof can feed any backend that reads it — exactly the role OTLP plays for traces. It's also why `go tool pprof` can open profiles from non-Go sources: the format, not the language, is the contract.

### Q: How does eBPF whole-system profiling work, and why is it a big deal?

eBPF lets you load a small, verified program into the **kernel** that runs on a perf event — e.g. on every CPU clock tick across the machine. On each tick it walks the stack of whatever's currently running (kernel *and* user space) and records it. A user-space agent (parca-agent, Pyroscope eBPF) aggregates those stacks into profiles and ships them.

The big deal: it profiles **any language with no instrumentation and no redeploy** — Go, C++, Rust, Python, Java, a stripped third-party binary, even the kernel itself — because it samples at the CPU level, below the language runtime. You deploy *one agent per node* (typically a DaemonSet) and you get CPU profiles for the entire fleet, polyglot or not, without touching a single application.

**What-if — "What's the catch with eBPF profiling?"** Three things. (1) **Symbolization is harder** — the agent captures addresses for arbitrary binaries, so you need symbols available (a symbol server) or you get hex. (2) **Unwinding stripped/FP-less binaries** needs DWARF-based unwinding in the kernel, which is more complex and CPU-heavier than frame-pointer walking. (3) It's mostly **CPU/on-CPU and some off-CPU** — for rich heap or allocation profiling you still often want the in-process language profiler, which understands the runtime's allocator. eBPF is the *breadth* play (every process, free); language SDKs are the *depth* play (allocation, GC, runtime detail).

**What-if — "When do you choose the language SDK over the eBPF agent?"** When you need profile types eBPF can't easily give you — **heap/allocation, goroutine, mutex/block** profiles that require runtime knowledge — or when you want exemplar-style correlation to traces from inside the app. Many fleets run *both*: eBPF for blanket CPU coverage of everything, plus the language SDK on key services for heap and trace correlation.

### Q: How do you profile each major language?

- **Go** — built in: `net/http/pprof` for live endpoints, `go tool pprof` to analyse, `runtime/pprof` for programmatic capture. The reference implementation.
- **JVM** — **async-profiler** (`asprof -d 30 -e cpu -f flame.html <pid>`) attaches to a running JVM by PID, low-overhead, CPU/alloc/lock; and **Java Flight Recorder (JFR)**, the built-in low-overhead recorder you can leave on continuously.
- **Python** — **py-spy** (`py-spy record --pid <pid> -d 30 -o flame.svg`) attaches to an *already-running* process by PID — no `import`, no restart — and Pyroscope's Python SDK for continuous.
- **Node.js** — built-in V8 profiler (`node --prof`), or `0x` / `clinic` for friendlier flame graphs.
- **Rust** — `pprof-rs` for in-process pprof output, or `perf` + flame-graph tooling.
- **Language-agnostic** — eBPF (parca-agent, Pyroscope eBPF) for any of the above with no code changes.

**What-if — "Why is 'attach by PID' (py-spy, async-profiler) significant?"** Because it lets you profile a **production process without redeploying it**. You SSH to the box (or exec into the pod), attach to the live PID, capture 30 seconds, detach. That's the seed of continuous profiling: if you can profile a live process cheaply and without restarting it, you can automate doing it permanently across the fleet.

## Tricky / Trap Questions

### Q: The flame graph shows `main` as the widest box. Is `main` the problem?

Wrong instinct: "`main` is widest, so `main` is where the time goes — optimise `main`." **No.** `main` (or any root/near-root frame) is wide because *everything runs underneath it* — its width is the sum of all its descendants. There's almost nothing to optimise *in* `main` itself; its **self time is tiny**. The wide box at the bottom is meaningless for optimisation.

You read top-down and find the widest **leaf** — the function with high *self* time, the code actually on the CPU when sampled. That leaf (`json.Unmarshal`, `regexp.Compile`, `scanRows`) is the line to fix. Confusing a wide *total* (low in the tower) with a wide *self* (the leaf) is the most common flame-graph misread, and it's exactly the self-vs-total distinction in disguise.

### Q: The service is slow but the CPU profile is empty/flat. What's going on?

Wrong instinct: "the profiler is broken, restart it." It's working perfectly — it's telling you the program **wasn't burning CPU**. The latency is in **waiting**: blocked on a DB query, a lock, a channel, a downstream call, a slow disk. A CPU profile is *blind* to off-CPU time by construction.

Reach for the **off-CPU / wall-clock profile**, which records where the program was *blocked* and for how long. The classic finding: every request blocked 200ms on a single un-pooled DB connection — invisible to CPU, obvious in off-CPU. "Slow but idle CPU" is the canonical signal that you're looking at the wrong profile type.

### Q: You're reading the flame graph left-to-right to see what ran first. Stop me.

Wrong instinct: "the leftmost box ran first, then the one to its right, and so on." **The x-axis is not time and left-to-right order means nothing** — frames are sorted **alphabetically** so that identical subtrees merge into one wide box. A flame graph is a *heat map of where the resource piled up*, not a *route showing the order you visited places*. Asking "but what happened first?" is asking a flame graph to be a trace. If you need execution order and timing, that's a **trace**; if you need where the resource went, that's the profile.

### Q: You averaged two pods' p99-window profiles to get a "fleet flame graph." Is that right?

Wrong instinct treats profiles like scalars you can average. You don't *average* profiles — you **sum (merge) the sample counts** stack-by-stack, then render. Profiles are made of additive sample counts; merging two profiles means adding the counts for each shared stack, the way you'd add histogram buckets, not averaging percentages. (This mirrors the metrics rule that you aggregate raw distributions before computing a percentile, never average the percentiles.) The good news: because samples are additive, merging across the fleet is exact addition — which is precisely why a continuous-profiling backend can show you one flame graph for 5,000 pods over an hour.

The subtler trap is mixing *traffic-weighted* windows: if pod A served 1M requests and pod B served 10, a naive merge is dominated by A — which is usually *correct* (it reflects where the fleet's resource actually went), but be deliberate about whether you want fleet-total or per-pod-normalised.

### Q: Your diff flame graph says the new deploy is faster, everywhere blue. The deploy made things slower. What happened?

Wrong instinct: "blue means improvement, ship it." You almost certainly set the **diff base backwards**. In `go tool pprof -diff_base=A B`, `A` is the baseline and red/blue is measured *in B relative to A*. If you passed the *new, slow* profile as the base and the *old, fast* one as the subject, every real regression shows up as **blue (looks like an improvement)** and every real improvement shows as red. **A diff is a delta, and the delta's sign depends entirely on which profile is the base.** Re-run with the *previous* release as `-diff_base` and the regression turns bright red.

A second cause: comparing two windows with very different traffic using raw counts (`-base`) instead of normalised (`-diff_base`) — the busier window looks "worse" everywhere purely because it had more samples, not because the code regressed.

### Q: A function you know is hot doesn't appear in the flame graph at all. Is the profiler wrong?

Wrong instinct: "the profiler missed it, it's unreliable." Two innocent explanations before you blame the tool. (1) **Inlining** — the compiler inlined that small function into its caller, so its cost is attributed to the caller's frame; it's there, just folded in. (2) **Undersampling** — if the function runs briefly and rarely, no sample may have landed on it; profiles are statistical, and *absence is weak evidence*. Collect longer or raise the sample rate before concluding anything. The reliable read is the other way round: a box that *is* wide is almost certainly real.

### Q: You profiled for 2 seconds and the flame graph looks random. Why?

Wrong instinct: "the workload is just chaotic." A 2-second CPU profile at ~100 Hz is only ~200 samples — statistical *noise*, not signal. Thin boxes dominate, nothing converges, and re-running gives a different picture. Profiles need enough samples to converge: **30 seconds is a sane default**, longer for rare paths. The randomness is the sampling error of too small a sample, not a property of your code.

## System / Design Scenarios

### Q: Design continuous profiling for a 5,000-pod, polyglot (Go/Java/Python/Rust) fleet.

**Breadth via eBPF, depth via SDKs, one backend, time-indexed storage.**

1. **Blanket CPU coverage with an eBPF agent** (parca-agent / Pyroscope eBPF) as a **DaemonSet** — one agent per node profiles *every* process regardless of language, no app changes. This is how you cover the polyglot fleet cheaply and uniformly.
2. **Language SDKs on key services** for the profile types eBPF can't easily give: **heap/allocation, goroutine, mutex/block**, and trace correlation. Go gets `net/http/pprof`, JVM gets JFR/async-profiler, Python gets the Pyroscope SDK.
3. **A symbol server.** Prod binaries are stripped; ship symbols (or build IDs) to a symbol server so the backend symbolizes offline. Without this, eBPF profiles are hex.
4. **One backend, pprof as the interchange format** (Pyroscope/Parca/Polar Signals), storing profiles **time-indexed** with labels (`service`, `version`, `region`, `pod`) so you can query "CPU by function for `checkout`, last hour" and "diff `v2` vs `v1`."
5. **Overhead budget** — fix a fleet-wide CPU budget (e.g. ≤1%), set sample rates to honour it, and *monitor the profiler's own cost* so it can't silently grow.
6. **Retention by tier** — keep high-resolution recent profiles for days, downsample/aggregate older ones; storage is dominated by profile volume × retention.
7. **Correlation** — wire profile labels to trace/exemplar IDs so you can jump from a slow span to its flame graph.

**What-if — "Why eBPF for breadth instead of just SDKs everywhere?"** Because instrumenting 5,000 pods across four languages and a pile of third-party binaries is a multi-quarter rollout with per-language gaps; one eBPF DaemonSet gives you CPU profiles for *everything* on day one, including processes you can't recompile. SDKs then fill in the depth (heap, locks) where it pays.

### Q: The continuous profiler is itself causing latency. Diagnose and fix it, live.

Stop the bleed, then root-cause. The profiler is supposed to cost ~1–2%; if it's hurting latency, something is mis-tuned.

1. **Confirm it's the profiler.** Disable the agent / SDK on a canary node and compare p99 to the rest of the fleet. If latency recovers, it's the profiler.
2. **Check the sample rate.** Someone may have cranked CPU sampling far above ~100 Hz, or set an aggressive mutex/block fraction. In Go, `SetMutexProfileFraction(1)` and a tiny `SetBlockProfileRate` sample *everything* and can be brutal under contention — dial them back to sane fractions.
3. **Check off-CPU / block profiling overhead** — its cost scales with *block-event rate*, not a fixed frequency, so a service that blocks millions of times a second pays far more than the nominal 1–2%. Lower the fraction or disable off-CPU on that service.
4. **Check unwinding cost** — DWARF unwinding for FP-less binaries is heavier than frame-pointer walking; if a hot service is compiled without frame pointers, the eBPF unwinder works hard each tick. Rebuild with frame pointers if feasible.
5. **Check symbolization location** — symbolizing *in-process* on the hot path is a mistake; it should happen *offline* in the backend from a symbol server.
6. **Restore the budget** — set and enforce a per-node CPU budget for the agent, and add an alert on the profiler's own CPU so the next regression trips a limit, not an incident.

**What-if — "How do you bound profiler overhead by design?"** A declared **overhead budget** (e.g. ≤1% CPU) baked into sample-rate config, plus monitoring the profiler's own resource use as a first-class metric. The profiler is a *tax*; like any tax you set the rate deliberately and watch it, rather than discovering the bill in a latency postmortem.

### Q: There was a latency spike at 14:32. Walk me from the alert to the line of code.

This is the workflow continuous profiling exists for — **no reproduction.**

1. **Metric** alerts: p99 latency for `search` jumped at 14:32.
2. **Trace** for a slow request in that window shows the time is inside `search-service` (480ms), not the DB or cache.
3. **Profile**: query the continuous-profiling backend for `search-service`'s **CPU profile scoped to the 14:32 window** (`service=search`, time range = the spike). Because profiles are stored time-indexed, this flame graph already exists.
4. **Read it top-down**: the widest leaf is `regexp.Compile` at 60% — a pattern being recompiled per request because a cache miss bypassed the compiled-regex cache.
5. **Confirm with a diff** if you suspect a deploy: `-diff_base` the 14:32 window against a healthy 14:00 baseline; `regexp.Compile` lights up red.
6. **Log** confirms the *why*: "search: recompiled pattern (cache miss)."

The fix is the line, found from history. The whole point: you queried the past, you didn't reproduce the present.

**What-if — "What ties the trace at 14:32 to that specific flame graph?"** Shared **labels and exemplars**. Profiles carry labels (`service`, `version`, `region`) and a time index, so you scope to the same service + window as the trace. With **profile-to-trace correlation** (exemplars), the backend can link a slow span directly to a representative profile, so you click the span and land on its flame graph — the same bridge exemplars provide from a metric histogram bucket to a trace.

### Q: Build a deploy gate that fails on a CPU regression.

A regression gate is a **diff profile run automatically in CI/CD**:

1. **Capture a baseline** — the current production release's CPU profile over a representative window (or a fixed load test), stored as `old.pb.gz`.
2. **Capture the candidate** — run the new build under the *same* load and capture `new.pb.gz`.
3. **Diff with the right base and normalisation**: `go tool pprof -diff_base=old.pb.gz new.pb.gz` so red = grew in the candidate relative to baseline. Use `-diff_base` (normalised) not `-base`, since the two runs may not have identical sample totals.
4. **Threshold the delta** — programmatically extract the top regressed frames and **fail the gate** if any function's CPU share grew beyond a budget (e.g. "no single function may gain >5% of total CPU," or "total CPU must not rise >10%").
5. **Surface the evidence** — attach the diff flame graph to the PR so the author sees the red tower, not just a red X.

**What-if — "What's the failure mode of this gate?"** Two. (1) **Direction/normalisation errors** — base backwards or raw `-base` across different traffic — make it pass regressions and block fixes; pin the base direction and normalise. (2) **Noisy thresholds** — profiles are statistical, so a tight threshold flaps on sampling noise. Use a long-enough capture and a margin above the noise floor, and gate on *sustained* shifts (or compare distributions across several runs) rather than a single thin box.

### Q: How does continuous profiling relate to point-in-time profiling and the other three signals?

**Point-in-time profiling** (the laptop, one-off, "now I'll fix this function" mode) and **continuous profiling** are the same *profiler*, used differently. Continuous profiling **finds** the hot function in production — under real load, time-indexed, queryable, diffable. Point-in-time profiling is where you then **optimise** it: iterate on a microbenchmark, re-profile, watch the box shrink. One is detection at fleet scale; the other is the fix loop. (In this roadmap, point-in-time profiling lives under Quality Engineering → Performance → Profiling.)

Against the **four signals**: profiling is the fourth, below the span boundary that traces stop at. Metric → "slow," trace → "which span," profile → "which line," and a log gives the human-readable *why*. They compose: you rarely start from the profile — a metric or trace points you at the service and window, and the profile finishes the job.

**What-if — "Could continuous profiling replace tracing?"** No. A profile is *aggregated over a window* and has no notion of a single request's causal path across services — it can't tell you that *this user's* checkout crossed five services in this order. Tracing owns per-request, cross-service causality and timing; profiling owns where the resource went inside the code. They answer different questions and correlation between them is the point, not substitution.

## Behavioral / Experience

### Q: Tell me about a time profiling found a non-obvious bug.

The interviewer wants arc, evidence, surprise, lesson — not "I love flame graphs." Example skeleton:

- **Symptom.** p99 on a JSON API climbed 3× over a week with no traffic change; CPU per pod was up but nothing in the code had obviously changed.
- **Wrong first move.** Team suspected the database (the usual scapegoat) and spent a day on query plans that were fine.
- **Investigation.** Pulled the continuous CPU profile for the regressed window and diffed it (`-diff_base`) against a profile from a week earlier. `time.LoadLocation` lit up bright red — 40% of CPU, called per request.
- **Root cause.** A refactor had moved a timezone lookup inside the hot path; it re-parsed the tz database on every request instead of once at startup. Invisible to metrics, invisible to traces (it was "just CPU in the handler"), obvious in the diff.
- **Resolution.** Hoisted the lookup to init; p99 dropped below the original baseline. Re-profiled to confirm the red tower was gone.
- **Lesson.** The diff profile turned a week-long mystery into a five-minute find. Profile the regression against history before theorising.

Tell *one* story, with concrete numbers, and end on what changed in how the team works.

**What-if — "What if the off-CPU profile, not the CPU profile, was the hero?"** Even better — it shows range. "CPU was flat but latency was high; the off-CPU profile showed every request blocked 200ms on a connection-pool wait of size 2. Bumping the pool and adding a saturation metric fixed it. Lesson: when CPU is flat and latency is high, the answer is *always* off-CPU."

### Q: Sell continuous profiling to a skeptical team worried about the overhead.

Shows you can drive adoption, not just operate a tool. The pitch:

- **Lead with the number and a canary.** "Sampling profilers cost ~1–2% CPU because they're statistical — they act on a timer tick, not on every call. And I won't ask you to trust me: we'll run it on one canary node, measure the *actual* overhead and latency delta against the rest of the fleet, and only roll out if it's within budget."
- **Frame it as a tax with a cap.** "We set an overhead budget — say ≤1% — bake it into the sample rate, and monitor the profiler's own CPU as a first-class metric. If it ever exceeds budget, we get paged before customers do."
- **Show the payoff with their last incident.** "Remember the 14:32 spike we spent two hours reproducing? With this, the flame graph for 14:32 already exists — we'd have had the line in minutes." Concrete, their pain, their win.
- **Start eBPF, zero code.** "The eBPF agent needs *no* code changes and no redeploy — one DaemonSet. You don't even touch your services to try it." Removes the integration objection entirely.

**What-if — "They say 'we'll just profile on a laptop when we need to.'"** "That works until the bug only happens in prod — real data, real concurrency, a cold cache. You can't reproduce it, so the laptop profiler profiles a different program. Continuous profiling means the evidence already exists when the incident hits; you query the past instead of failing to reproduce the present. It's a dashcam, not a camera you grab after the crash."

### Q: Tell me about a time you removed or simplified profiling rather than adding it.

Shows maturity — most engineers only ever add tooling. Example: "We were running an aggressive mutex/block profile fraction *and* in-process symbolization on a high-contention service — together costing ~4% CPU and occasionally spiking latency. I dialled the mutex fraction back to a sane sample, moved symbolization offline to the backend via a symbol server, and dropped per-process heap profiling on services where the eBPF CPU profile already answered our questions. Overhead went back under budget with zero loss of the signal we actually used. Lesson: profiling is a tax — you tune the rate to what you query, not to 'capture everything.'"

## What I'd Ask a Candidate Now

Questions that separate "knows the model" from "has run profiling in anger."

### Q: A request is slow but the CPU profile is empty. What do you do?

The single best junior/mid discriminator. Strong answer instantly: "Switch to the **off-CPU / wall-clock** profile — the time is in *waiting* (I/O, lock, channel), which a CPU profile can't see." A candidate who keeps staring at the CPU profile, or restarts the profiler assuming it's broken, hasn't internalised on-CPU vs off-CPU.

### Q: In a flame graph, what does width mean, and is the x-axis time?

Listening for two precise facts: **width = aggregate sample count = share of the resource** (not time, not call count), and **the x-axis is NOT time — frames are alphabetical, order is meaningless.** A candidate who says "width is how long it ran" or reads it as a timeline is going to misdiagnose every flame graph they ever see. Bonus for self-vs-total and "optimise the widest *leaf*, not the wide root."

### Q: Why can you leave a sampling profiler on in production but not an instrumenting one?

Reveals whether they understand the mechanism. Strong answer: "Sampling acts only on a timer tick (~100 Hz), so cost is bounded by the **sample rate, not the workload** — ~1–2%. An instrumenting profiler times *every* function entry/exit — 10–100× slowdown, fine for a microbenchmark, impossible in prod." A candidate who can't explain *why* it's cheap will mis-tune the sample rate and either burn CPU or collect noise.

### Q: You're diffing two profiles to check a deploy. What's the one thing you must get right?

The staff-level detail: **the base direction.** "`-diff_base=old new` measures change *in new relative to old*, so red = grew in the new release. Get the base backwards and a regression shows up as blue (an improvement) — you'd ship it." A diff is a delta and a delta has a sign; a candidate who hand-waves the direction will eventually pass a regression through a deploy gate.

### Q: How would you profile a polyglot fleet without instrumenting every service?

Operational maturity check. Good answer: "**eBPF whole-system profiling** — one agent per node (DaemonSet) profiles any language from the kernel with zero code changes, plus a symbol server for symbolization. Layer language SDKs on key services for heap/lock/goroutine profiles eBPF can't give." Bad sign: "we'd add an SDK to all 5,000 services" (a multi-quarter rollout with gaps) or not knowing eBPF profiling exists.

### Q: A flame graph shows `main` as the widest box. What do you conclude?

Self-vs-total in disguise — a fast trap. "Nothing actionable — `main` is wide because everything runs under it; its *self* time is tiny. Read top-down to the widest **leaf**, the function with high self time, and optimise *that*." A candidate who says "optimise `main`" has never actually used a flame graph to fix something.
