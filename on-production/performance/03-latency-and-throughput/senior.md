# Latency and Throughput — Senior

<!-- level-focus -->
At senior level, focus on this question:

> Which system invariant is affected by **Latency and Throughput** under failure, load, and change?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Performance](../README.md) → Latency and Throughput
> *The middle page taught you to read a percentile chart. This page is about the physics underneath it: why p99 of one backend becomes the p50 of a fan-out request, why a queue's response time explodes as utilization passes 70%, and why your load generator has almost certainly been lying to you about tail latency for years.*

## Queueing Theory — Why Response Time Is Nonlinear

Every server is a queue. Requests arrive, wait if the server is busy, get served, and leave. The single most important consequence of treating it as a queue is this: **response time does not grow linearly with load — it grows hyperbolically and has a vertical asymptote at 100% utilization.** Engineers who reason linearly ("we're at 50%, so doubling traffic is fine") get destroyed by this.

Start with the canonical model, **M/M/1**: Markovian (Poisson) arrivals at rate **λ**, Markovian (exponential) service at rate **μ**, one server. Define **utilization** ρ = λ/μ (the fraction of time the server is busy; the system is only stable if ρ < 1). The closed-form results:

```
Utilization        ρ = λ / μ
Avg # in system    L = ρ / (1 − ρ)
Avg response time  W = (1/μ) / (1 − ρ) = Ws / (1 − ρ)      ← Ws = 1/μ = base service time
Avg wait in queue  Wq = ρ · Ws / (1 − ρ)
```

The term that matters is the **1/(1 − ρ)** factor. It is the *amplification* the queue applies to your base service time. Tabulate it and the danger becomes visceral:

| Utilization ρ | 1/(1−ρ) | Response time vs. service time |
|---|---|---|
| 0.50 | 2.0 | 2× the bare service time |
| 0.70 | 3.3 | 3.3× |
| 0.80 | 5.0 | 5× |
| 0.90 | 10.0 | 10× |
| 0.95 | 20.0 | 20× |
| 0.99 | 100.0 | 100× |

A service whose base latency is 1 ms running at 50% utilization responds in ~2 ms. The *same code* at 90% responds in ~10 ms; at 99% it responds in ~100 ms. Nothing about the work changed — only the queue. This is why capacity planning that targets 80–90% CPU "to save money" is a tail-latency time bomb: you are buying a 5–10× latency multiplier.

Adding servers helps, but with diminishing geometry. The **M/M/c** model (c parallel servers, one shared queue — the correct model for a thread pool or a connection pool) replaces the simple factor with the **Erlang-C** probability **P_wait** that an arriving request must queue:

```
Wq = P_wait · Ws / (c · (1 − ρ))      where ρ = λ / (c · μ)   (per-server utilization)
```

The crucial, counter-intuitive M/M/c result: **one big pool of c servers beats c independent pools of one server each**, because a single shared queue lets any idle server pick up any waiting request. This is the queueing-theory argument *against* sharding work into per-core or per-shard queues with no work-stealing — partitioned queues idle while a neighbor's queue backs up. (Go's runtime scheduler embodies the opposite lesson: per-P run queues *plus* work-stealing, to get partition locality without the partitioned-queue tail.)

> **Key insight:** Response time isn't linear in load — it's `Ws / (1 − ρ)`. The headroom you keep below 100% utilization isn't waste; it is the budget that pays for your tail latency. The difference between 70% and 95% utilization is the difference between a 3× and a 20× latency multiplier on identical code.

## Variability Kills Tails — Kingman's Approximation

M/M/1 assumes exponential service times. Real service times are not exponential — they have *their own* variability, and that variability is the dominant driver of queue-induced latency. The result that captures this is **Kingman's formula** (the VUT equation), the approximation for the general **G/G/1** queue (general arrival distribution, general service distribution, one server):

```
              ρ        c_a² + c_s²
Wq  ≈   Ws · ─────  ·  ───────────
            1 − ρ          2

         └── Utilization ──┘   └── Variability ──┘
```

Read the three factors — Kingman calls them **V·U·T**:

- **T** = `Ws`, the base service **Time**.
- **U** = `ρ/(1−ρ)`, the **Utilization** amplifier — the same hyperbola as before.
- **V** = `(c_a² + c_s²)/2`, the **Variability** term, where `c_a` is the coefficient of variation of *inter-arrival* times and `c_s` the coefficient of variation of *service* times. (`c = σ/mean`; for an exponential distribution `c = 1`, which recovers M/M/1.)

The variability term is the senior's lever. It says queue wait scales with the **square** of the coefficient of variation of your service time. Halve your service-time variance and you roughly halve the queueing delay at any given utilization. Concretely: a service whose requests take a uniform 1 ms (`c_s ≈ 0`) queues *far* less than one averaging 1 ms but occasionally taking 50 ms (high `c_s`), even at identical mean throughput.

This is why these things destroy tails out of proportion to their average cost:

- **GC pauses** (a Java stop-the-world or a Go STW phase) inject occasional multi-millisecond service times into an otherwise sub-millisecond distribution — they spike `c_s`.
- **Cold caches, lock contention, occasional disk hits, TLS handshakes** — anything that makes *some* requests dramatically slower than the median.
- **Slow-path branches** (validation failures, retries, large payloads) that share the same server pool as fast requests.

The mitigation strategy follows directly: *reduce service-time variance*, not just the mean. Isolate slow work onto separate pools so it can't inject variance into the fast path; cap request work; use allocation-light hot paths to avoid GC; tune the GC for pause time over throughput when latency is the SLO (Go's GC, the JVM's ZGC/Shenandoah). You are managing the second moment of the distribution, not the first.

> **Key insight:** At fixed throughput, the thing that determines your tail is service-time *variance*, and Kingman shows it enters quadratically (`c_s²`). A latency engineer's job is as much about making service times *uniform* as making them *fast* — a predictable 2 ms beats a 1 ms-average that occasionally hits 40 ms.

## The Tail at Scale — Why Fan-Out Amplifies p99

Here is the result that reorganizes how you think about distributed latency. Dean & Barroso's observation: **in a service that fans out to many backends and waits for all of them, the latency of the *slowest* backend determines the response — so a rare slow event at the leaf becomes a common slow event at the root.**

Make it arithmetic. Suppose each backend independently responds within its p99 latency 99% of the time (i.e., 1% chance of being "slow"). A root request that fans out to **N** backends and must wait for all N is fast only if *every* backend is fast:

```
P(root request is "fast")  = (0.99)^N
P(root hits a slow backend) = 1 − (0.99)^N
```

| Fan-out N | P(at least one slow backend) |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1% |
| 5 | 4.9% |
| 10 | 9.6% |
| 100 | 63% |
| 200 | 87% |

At a fan-out of 100, a per-backend 1-in-100 tail event becomes a **63%** chance per root request. The leaf's p99 has become *worse than* the root's p50. This is not a bug in any one service — it is the statistics of "wait for the slowest of N." Modern services routinely fan out to dozens or hundreds of shards (a search query, a feed assembly, a fan-out write), so this is the *normal* operating regime, not an edge case.

A second amplifier compounds it: **the more components a request touches, the higher the chance of hitting *each component's* own tail.** A request that traverses 5 services in series, each with a 1% chance of a slow response, has a `1 − 0.99^5 ≈ 4.9%` chance of a slow leg somewhere — even though no single service degraded.

The structural consequences Dean & Barroso draw:

- **Reducing component-level tail latency** is leveraged: shaving the leaf p99 helps the root p50 dramatically because of the exponent.
- **You cannot eliminate tails by averaging more requests** — fan-out makes them *more* likely, not less.
- **The right defenses are architectural**, treating tail latency as a property to be *tolerated* rather than *eliminated*, exactly as fault-tolerance treats failures.

> **Key insight:** `(0.99)^N` is the whole story. A 1% per-backend tail is invisible at N=1 and catastrophic at N=100. In any fan-out system, the leaf's p99 is the budget that sets the root's *median*, which is why "just make the common case fast" is not enough — you must make the *tail* of every dependency bounded.

---

## Tail-Tolerance Techniques — Hedging, Tied Requests, Micro-Partitioning

If you can't eliminate tails, you tolerate them. Dean & Barroso name a toolkit; each trades a little extra work for a much tighter tail.

**Hedged requests.** Send the request to one replica; if no response arrives within, say, the **p95** latency (a brief deferral, not immediate duplication), send a *second* copy to another replica and take whichever returns first. The first request covers the common case; the hedge covers the tail. Because you only hedge the slow ~5%, the extra load is small (~5%) but the tail improvement is large — the hedge wins whenever the original was about to be a tail event.

```go
// Hedged request: fire the backup only if the primary is slow.
func hedged(ctx context.Context, call func(context.Context) (Resp, error), hedgeAfter time.Duration) (Resp, error) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
    defer cancel() // cancel the loser as soon as we have a winner

    results := make(chan result, 2)
    go func() { r, e := call(ctx); results <- result{r, e} }()

    select {
    case res := <-results:
        return res.r, res.err            // primary returned before the hedge deadline
    case <-time.After(hedgeAfter):       // primary is in the slow tail — hedge it
        go func() { r, e := call(ctx); results <- result{r, e} }()
        res := <-results
        return res.r, res.err            // whichever replica answers first
    }
}
```

**Tied requests.** Hedging still wastes work — both copies may run to completion. *Tied* requests enqueue the request on *two* replicas simultaneously, but each copy carries the identity of the other; when one replica *starts executing*, it sends a cancellation to its twin. The tie is broken by which queue drains first (cheap to detect), not by waiting out a timeout, so you get tail protection with minimal duplicated *execution* — only duplicated *queueing*. This requires cross-replica cancellation, which is why it lives in the data layer (Google's storage systems) rather than in application code.

**Request cancellation / deadline propagation.** The dual of hedging: when a response is no longer needed (the winner returned, or the client's deadline passed), *cancel* the loser so it stops consuming capacity — capacity that would otherwise raise ρ and worsen everyone's tail (per Kingman). In gRPC this is automatic via **deadline propagation**: a deadline set at the edge flows through every downstream call, and an expired deadline cancels the in-flight RPC chain. Honor `ctx.Done()` everywhere; a request that keeps working after its deadline is pure tail-inflating waste.

**Micro-partitioning.** Slice data into many more partitions than machines (say 20× more), so each machine holds dozens of small partitions. When one machine is slow or hot, its partitions are cheaply redistributed in small increments rather than moving one giant shard — and load balances at fine granularity. Fine partitions also make recovery and rebalancing fast, which keeps transient hotspots from becoming sustained tail events.

**Good-enough / quorum responses.** When fan-out makes "wait for all N" untenable, return once a *quorum* (or "enough") of backends have replied, accepting slightly stale or incomplete results to escape the slowest backend's tail. A search root that has heard from 95% of its leaves can return rather than wait for the last 5% — trading a sliver of completeness for a bounded p99. The 5% of leaves still in flight are then *cancelled*.

> **Key insight:** Every tail-tolerance technique is the same bet — spend a little extra capacity or accept a little staleness to cut the dependence on the slowest unit of work. Hedging duplicates ~5% of requests; tied requests duplicate queueing but not execution; quorums drop the slowest few percent of results. All of them attack the `(0.99)^N` exponent by making the root not wait on its slowest leaf.

## Coordinated Omission — How Load Tests Hide Latency

This section will change how you trust every latency number you've ever seen. **Coordinated omission** is a systematic measurement error, named by Gil Tene, in which a load generator's *own* slowness causes it to *skip* sending requests during the exact periods the system is slowest — so the worst latencies are never recorded, and the reported tail is wildly optimistic.

The mechanism, in the common synchronous-loop load generator:

```
loop:
    t0 = now()
    response = send_request()      // blocks until the response comes back
    record(now() - t0)
    // immediately loop and send the next request
```

The bug is "immediately loop and send the next request." If the server stalls for 1 second (a GC pause, a lock convoy, a failover), the loop *blocks* inside `send_request()` for that whole second. It records exactly **one** slow sample (~1000 ms). But during that stalled second, at the intended rate of, say, 1000 req/s, **1000 requests that should have been sent were never sent**. In the real world those 1000 requests *did* arrive — they queued behind the stall and each experienced part of that 1-second delay (1000 ms, 999 ms, 998 ms, …, down to ~1 ms). The load generator silently omitted all 1000, recording only the single straggler.

The damage to percentiles is enormous. Tene's canonical illustration: a system that runs at 0 ms for 100 seconds and then stalls for 100 seconds reports a naive p99.99 of essentially 0 ms — because the long stall produced only one giant sample — when the *true* p99.99, accounting for everyone who waited, is on the order of tens of seconds. **Coordinated omission can understate the tail by one to two orders of magnitude.** A reported p99 of 5 ms can hide a true p99 of 500 ms.

There are two correct fixes, and good tools implement both:

1. **Constant-rate (open-model) load.** Schedule each request at its *intended* send time (`start_time = i / rate`) regardless of when the previous one finished. If the response comes back late, the *intended-to-actual* gap is the real latency that request would have experienced. This is the **open model** (arrivals independent of completions) versus the buggy **closed model** (next arrival waits for previous completion). `wrk2` (Tene's fork of `wrk`) does exactly this — you specify a fixed `-R rate` and it measures from intended schedule.

2. **Latency back-filling correction.** When a sample exceeds the expected inter-request interval, synthesize the omitted samples that *would* have queued during the stall, decaying from the observed latency down to the interval. **HdrHistogram**'s `recordValueWithExpectedInterval(value, expectedInterval)` does this: it records the real sample *and* the implied missing ones, reconstructing the true distribution.

```java
// HdrHistogram with coordinated-omission correction built in.
Histogram h = new Histogram(3);                 // 3 significant digits
long expectedIntervalNanos = 1_000_000;         // 1 ms between requests at 1000 req/s

long start = System.nanoTime();
doRequest();
long elapsed = System.nanoTime() - start;
// records the sample AND back-fills the requests omitted during a stall:
h.recordValueWithExpectedInterval(elapsed, expectedIntervalNanos);
```

Practical rules that follow:
- Use **`wrk2`, not `wrk`**; specify a target rate, not "as fast as possible." A "max throughput" run is *intrinsically* coordinated-omission-prone because there is no intended schedule to measure against.
- Drive load **below saturation**. At ρ ≥ 1 the closed model degenerates entirely; the only meaningful latency numbers come from an open model at a sustainable rate.
- Prefer tools and libraries that record into **HdrHistogram** (or a t-digest) with correction, and report the full distribution, not a single average.

> **Key insight:** The cheap way to measure latency — a loop that sends the next request after the previous returns — *cannot see* the latencies it causes by stalling, because the load generator stalls in lockstep with the server. Honest latency measurement requires an *open model* (constant intended rate) and/or *back-filling* (HdrHistogram). If your tool doesn't do one of these, your tail numbers are fiction.

## Percentile Statistics Pitfalls — Don't Add, Can't Average

Percentiles are the right summary for user-facing latency, but they obey rules that violate everyone's arithmetic instincts. Get these wrong and you will report numbers that are not just imprecise but *meaningless*.

**Percentiles don't add.** The p99 of a request that traverses A then B is **not** `p99(A) + p99(B)`. That sum assumes both legs hit their p99 *simultaneously* on the same request, which is the rare case, not the typical one. For independent legs the true end-to-end p99 is *less* than the sum of the per-leg p99s (you'd need both tails to coincide), and computing it requires convolving the distributions, not adding quantiles. The only correct way to get an end-to-end percentile is to measure the *end-to-end* latency directly and take *its* percentile. Decomposing a budget into per-leg p99s that sum to the target is a useful *planning heuristic* but is conservative — it over-provisions.

**Percentiles can't be averaged.** You cannot average the p99 of three machines to get the fleet p99. `avg(p99_a, p99_b, p99_c)` is not the p99 of the combined population — averaging quantiles is statistically nonsense. If machine A served 1M requests and B served 1K, their p99s carry vastly different weight; and even with equal weight, the quantile of a mixture is not the mean of the components' quantiles. The same applies across *time*: you cannot average per-minute p99s to get an hourly p99.

So how *do* you aggregate? You must aggregate the **distributions**, then compute the percentile from the merged distribution. This is exactly why mergeable sketches exist:

- **HdrHistogram** uses fixed, log-linear buckets with a configured precision (significant digits). Two histograms with the same configuration **merge by summing bucket counts** — `a.add(b)` — and you compute any percentile from the merged counts. Mergeability with bounded relative error is the whole point: each machine emits a histogram, a central system sums them, and the true fleet p99 falls out.
- **t-digest** (Dunning) is a mergeable sketch optimized for *extreme* quantiles — it keeps fine resolution at the tails (p99, p99.9) and coarse resolution in the middle, so it answers p99.9 accurately with little memory. Digests merge by combining and re-clustering their centroids. This is what powers tail-percentile estimates in many metrics backends.

```
// Correct fleet aggregation: merge distributions, THEN read the percentile.
fleet = HdrHistogram(precision=3)
for each machine m:
    fleet.add(m.histogram)        // sum bucket counts — mergeable by construction
fleet_p99 = fleet.percentile(99)  // computed from merged counts, not from per-machine p99s
```

**Beware the average entirely for latency.** The mean is dominated by the body and blind to the tail; a service can hold a 2 ms mean while 1% of users wait 2 seconds. Report distributions and high percentiles (p99, p99.9), and remember that *which users* hit the tail matters — the tail is often concentrated on the heaviest, most valuable accounts.

> **Key insight:** A percentile is a property of a *distribution*, so you can only combine percentiles by combining the distributions they came from. Adding per-stage p99s over-counts (they rarely coincide); averaging per-machine p99s is meaningless. Emit mergeable histograms (HdrHistogram) or tail-accurate sketches (t-digest), merge those, and read the percentile from the merged result.

## USE and RED — Two Methods, Two Vantage Points

Two complementary methodologies tell you *where* latency is being created. They answer different questions, and a senior uses both.

**USE — Utilization, Saturation, Errors** (Brendan Gregg) is a **resource-centric** checklist. For every resource — CPU, memory, disk, network, and *also* software resources like thread pools, connection pools, and lock-protected sections — ask:

- **Utilization:** what fraction of time is it busy? (ρ from the queueing section.)
- **Saturation:** how much *queued, waiting* work has piled up? (run-queue length, pool wait count, socket backlog.)
- **Errors:** what is the error count?

USE is how you *localize a bottleneck*: walk the resources, find the one that's saturated, and you've found the queue driving your `1/(1−ρ)` blow-up. The Saturation signal is the early warning — utilization can read 100% while still keeping up, but *growing* saturation means the queue is unbounded and latency is heading for the asymptote.

**RED — Rate, Errors, Duration** (Tom Wilkie) is a **request-centric** checklist, one set of signals per *service*:

- **Rate:** requests per second (λ).
- **Errors:** failed requests per second.
- **Duration:** the *distribution* of request latency — not a mean, a histogram.

RED is how you *monitor user-facing health* and is the natural fit for microservices and dashboards: every service exports the same three signals, and Duration is your latency SLO surface. In a service mesh, **Envoy** emits exactly these (`upstream_rq_total`, `upstream_rq_xx`, `upstream_rq_time` histograms) per cluster, giving you RED for free at every hop.

The two compose: **RED tells you a service's latency is bad; USE tells you which resource inside it is the cause.** A spiking RED Duration on service X, cross-referenced with a saturated thread pool (USE Saturation) inside X, is a complete diagnosis: requests are queueing for threads, and `Wq` is climbing per Kingman. The USE Saturation signal is the one that lets you act *before* the RED Duration crosses the SLO — which is the entire point of [backpressure](#latency-budgets-and-backpressure-as-latency-protection).

> **Key insight:** RED watches the request stream (Rate/Errors/Duration) from the user's side; USE watches the resources (Utilization/Saturation/Errors) from the machine's side. Latency *symptoms* show up in RED Duration; latency *causes* show up in USE Saturation — and Saturation rising is your only pre-SLO-breach warning.

---

## Latency Budgets and Backpressure as Latency Protection

A **latency budget** allocates an end-to-end SLO across the components of a request path so that each owner knows their slice. If the user-facing SLO is "p99 ≤ 200 ms," you decompose it down the call tree:

```
End-to-end p99 budget: 200 ms
├─ Edge / TLS / gateway ........... 15 ms
├─ Auth service .................... 10 ms
├─ Business logic (this service) ... 40 ms
│   ├─ serialization .............. 5 ms
│   └─ business compute ........... 35 ms
├─ Database (p99) ................. 60 ms
├─ Cache lookups (2 × p99) ........ 10 ms
├─ Downstream RPC fan-out (p99) ... 50 ms
└─ Network + headroom ............. 15 ms
```

Two caveats keep this honest. First — from the percentile section — **the budget legs do not literally sum**, because per-leg p99s rarely coincide; summing them is a *conservative* allocation, which is fine for planning (it over-provisions) but means the real end-to-end p99 will usually beat the sum. Second, the budget is also a **deadline**: propagate it as a gRPC deadline from the edge so each hop knows how much time *remains*, and any hop that has already blown its slice can fail fast rather than do doomed work. A budget you don't enforce as a deadline is just a spreadsheet.

When demand exceeds capacity, the queueing math is merciless: ρ → 1, `Wq → ∞`, the queue grows without bound, and latency runs to the asymptote for *everyone*. The defenses are **backpressure** and **load shedding**, and the senior framing is that they are *latency-protection* mechanisms, not just availability mechanisms.

**Backpressure** propagates "I'm full" upstream so producers slow down instead of piling work into an unbounded queue. The enabling principle is **bounded queues**: an unbounded queue converts overload into *latency* (every request waits behind the backlog) and then into OOM; a *bounded* queue converts overload into *rejection* (fast, explicit) so the requests that *are* admitted keep meeting their SLO. gRPC flow control (HTTP/2 windows) and Go's bounded channels are backpressure primitives — a full channel blocks the producer by design.

**Load shedding** is the active form: when saturation crosses a threshold, *reject* excess requests immediately (HTTP 429 / gRPC `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) rather than admitting them into a growing queue. The latency logic is precise: admitting a request you can't serve within its deadline doesn't help that request *and* it raises ρ, inflating `Wq` for every other request (Kingman again). Shedding it early keeps utilization in the sane region of the `1/(1−ρ)` curve. Envoy's adaptive concurrency and circuit breakers, and the **CoDel**/PID-controller admission schemes (drop requests that have already queued past a target latency), are this principle in production. The advanced version sheds *by priority* — drop the cheap, low-value, or already-late work first, protecting the requests that still have budget.

```
                 admit                    serve
  request ──▶ [ bounded queue ] ──▶ [ workers (c) ] ──▶ response
                    │
                    └─ full / aged past deadline ──▶ 429 / RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED  (shed)

  Principle: keep ρ in the linear region. Shedding the excess
  protects the latency of everything you DO admit.
```

> **Key insight:** Backpressure and load shedding are latency mechanisms. An unbounded queue trades a throughput problem for a latency catastrophe (then an OOM); a bounded queue plus early shedding keeps utilization off the `1/(1−ρ)` cliff, so the requests you admit still hit their SLO. Saying "no" fast is how you keep "yes" fast.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Capacity-planning to 90%+ utilization to "save money."** That's a 10–20× latency multiplier per the `1/(1−ρ)` curve. Latency-sensitive services target 50–70% to keep the queue in its linear region; the headroom *is* the tail budget.

2. **Optimizing the mean service time while ignoring variance.** Kingman shows `c_s²` drives queue wait quadratically. A change that cuts the mean 1 ms but adds occasional 50 ms spikes makes your tail *worse*. Isolate variance-injecting work onto its own pool.

3. **Assuming more requests average the tail away.** In fan-out, more components make root tails *more* likely (`1 − 0.99^N`), not less. You cannot dilute a tail by aggregating; you must bound each dependency or use tail-tolerance.

4. **Trusting `wrk`/JMeter "max throughput" latency numbers.** Closed-loop, saturating load generators suffer coordinated omission and understate the tail by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Use `wrk2` with a fixed `-R rate` below saturation, recording into HdrHistogram.

5. **Summing per-stage p99s for an end-to-end p99.** They almost never coincide on the same request, so the sum over-counts. It's an acceptable *conservative budget*, but the real end-to-end p99 must be measured directly.

6. **Averaging p99s across machines or time windows.** Statistically meaningless. Merge the histograms/digests and compute the percentile from the merged distribution.

7. **Using unbounded queues / no load shedding.** Overload then turns into unbounded latency for everyone and eventually OOM. Bound every queue and shed (429 / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`) past a saturation/latency threshold, ideally by priority.

8. **Hedging or retrying without cancellation.** A hedge or retry that doesn't cancel the loser doubles the load it was meant to protect against, raising ρ and worsening the very tail you're fighting. Propagate deadlines and honor `ctx.Done()`.

## Apply it

1. State the system invariant that **Latency and Throughput** must protect.
2. Mark ownership, state, and failure propagation at each boundary.
3. Compare two designs under load, dependency failure, and future change.
4. Define recovery and compatibility behavior before implementation.
5. Test the riskiest assumption with a focused experiment.

## Verify your work

- The experiment supports the design with evidence, not preference.
- Failure injection shows the blast radius and recovery path.
- Compatibility checks cover old and new callers or data.
- Operational signals reveal invariant violations and recovery progress.

## Review questions

- Which invariant must remain true when Latency and Throughput fails?
- Where should recovery responsibility live, and why?
- Which assumption deserves an experiment before implementation?
- How can the design evolve without changing every consumer at once?
