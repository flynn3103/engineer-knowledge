# Memory Profiling — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Memory Profiling** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Profiling](../README.md) → [Memory Profiling](README.md) → Middle
> *The junior page taught you to capture a heap snapshot and read "what's big." This page teaches you to read it like a pro: the dominator tree, the retained set, the path to a GC root, and the two-snapshot diff that turns "memory keeps growing" into "this exact map is the leak."*

## Shallow vs Retained Size — the Most-Misread Number

Every heap tool shows two sizes per object, and confusing them is the single most common analysis error.

- **Shallow size** — the bytes of the object *itself*: its header plus its own fields. A `HashMap` with a million entries has a *tiny* shallow size — just the table pointer, the count, a couple of ints. The million entries live in *other* objects.
- **Retained size** — the bytes that would be freed *if this object were garbage-collected*: the object plus everything reachable *only* through it. The same `HashMap`'s retained size is the whole subtree — table, nodes, keys, values — every object that would die when the map dies.

```
Object                    Shallow      Retained
HashMap                        48     1,240,000,000   ← shallow tiny, retained huge
  ├─ Node[]  (table)        262,144     1,239,xxx,xxx
  │    └─ Node × 1,000,000   ...
String[]  (some array)  8,000,000         8,000,000   ← shallow ≈ retained (leaf-ish)
```

Sorting by **shallow** size surfaces big leaves (a giant `byte[]`, an interned-string pool) — occasionally the culprit, usually not. Sorting by **retained** size surfaces the *owners*: the one map, cache, or list whose removal reclaims the most memory. The owner is what you want, because the owner is what a single code change can release.

The catch: an object's retained size depends on *what else points into its subtree*. If two roots both reference a large array, that array belongs to *neither* one's retained set — killing either root frees nothing, because the other still holds it. Retained size is computed against the whole graph, which is exactly what the dominator tree is for.

> **Key insight:** Shallow size answers "how big is this object?" Retained size answers "how much memory does this object *cost me*?" Only the second question matters for a leak — and it's the one beginners never sort by. The leak is almost always a small-shallow, huge-retained node.

---

## The Dominator Tree — "If X Were Freed, What Comes With It?"

Retained size isn't magic; it's read off a structure called the **dominator tree**. Object **A dominates** object **B** if *every* path from a GC root to B passes through A. Equivalently: if A were removed, B becomes unreachable and dies. An object's retained set is exactly the set of objects it dominates, and its retained size is their total bytes.

This is why retained size is well-defined even in a tangled object graph. The array referenced by two roots is dominated by *neither* root individually — there's a path to it that avoids each one — so it sits higher in the dominator tree, under whatever node *all* paths share (in the limit, the synthetic root). That's the formal version of "killing one owner frees nothing if another still points in."

Eclipse MAT's central view is literally called the **Dominator Tree**, sorted by retained size:

```
Class Name                                    Shallow Heap    Retained Heap   Percentage
com.acme.SessionCache                                   48    1,240,184,320       62.4%
  └─ java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap             64    1,240,180,992       62.4%
       └─ ConcurrentHashMap$Node[]                 4,194,304   1,236,xxx,xxx       62.3%
            └─ com.acme.UserSession × 524,288       ...
com.acme.MetricsBuffer                                  32      198,400,016        9.9%
```

One read of this view tells you: 62% of the live heap is reachable through a single `SessionCache`, and it's a `ConcurrentHashMap` with half a million `UserSession` entries. You haven't proven it's a leak yet — but you've found the one object worth investigating, and you found it in seconds instead of scrolling a histogram of types.

> **Key insight:** The dominator tree turns a tangled reachability graph into a clean ownership tree where each node's subtree is exactly what dies with it. "Find the leak" becomes "walk down the dominator tree following the largest retained child until the bytes stop being justified." That walk is the core skill of heap analysis.

## GC Roots and Retention Paths — "What Keeps This Alive?"

Knowing *which* object retains the heap is half the answer. The other half — the half that names the bug — is *why it's still reachable*. An object is alive because there's a chain of references from a **GC root** down to it. That chain is the **retention path** (MAT calls it the **Path to GC Roots**), and the surprising link in it is your bug.

GC roots are the entry points the collector treats as "always alive":

- **Local variables / stack frames** of running threads.
- **Static fields** (Java statics, Go package-level vars) — live for the whole program.
- **Active threads / goroutines** themselves, and anything their stacks reference.
- **JNI / native references**, thread-locals, the system classloader's classes.

A retention path reads from the leaking object *up* to the root:

```
UserSession  @ 0x7f...a0
 └─ value of ConcurrentHashMap$Node
  └─ [1] of ConcurrentHashMap$Node[]
   └─ table of ConcurrentHashMap
    └─ sessions of com.acme.SessionCache
     └─ INSTANCE of com.acme.SessionCache        ← static field = GC ROOT
```

The last line is the diagnosis: a `static INSTANCE` holds a `ConcurrentHashMap` that nobody ever evicts from. The `UserSession` can't die because a static field transitively reaches it. The fix isn't "free the session" — it's "stop the static singleton from holding sessions forever" (bound the map, evict on logout). **The path to the root *is* the bug report.**

In MAT you right-click the object → **Path to GC Roots → exclude weak/soft references** (you exclude weak/soft because those *don't* prevent collection — including them produces paths that aren't real leaks). In Chrome DevTools the **Retainers** panel at the bottom of a heap snapshot shows the same thing: expand it to walk from the object up to a `(GC root)` or a `Window` / global.

> **Key insight:** Retained size says *how much*; the retention path says *why*. You can't fix a leak from retained size alone — you fix it from the path, because the path contains the one reference (a static map, an un-removed listener, a captured closure) that a code change must sever. Always end your analysis on a root, never on "it's big."

## inuse_space vs inuse_objects — Few Big or Many Small

Go's heap profile (and the equivalent in every tool) gives you two *in-use* measures, and which one you sort by changes what you find:

- **`inuse_space`** — live **bytes** by allocation site. Surfaces *few big* objects: a 200 MB slice, a cache holding large buffers.
- **`inuse_objects`** — live **object count** by allocation site. Surfaces *many small* objects: ten million 32-byte structs that individually look like nothing but collectively dominate the heap and crush the GC.

A leak can hide in either. A growing `map[string][]byte` of large blobs shows up loudly in `inuse_space`. A growing slice of millions of tiny structs (or a `sync.Map` accumulating tiny entries) may be modest in `inuse_space` but enormous in `inuse_objects` — and the object count is the tell.

```bash
# live bytes by site
go tool pprof -inuse_space  http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
# live object count by site
go tool pprof -inuse_objects http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

```
(pprof) top
Showing nodes accounting for 1.41GB, 96.2% of 1.46GB total
      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
    1.18GB 80.8% 80.8%     1.18GB 80.8%  acme/cache.(*Store).Put
    0.21GB 14.4% 95.2%     0.21GB 14.4%  acme/proto.Unmarshal
```

`flat` is bytes allocated *at* that function and still live; `cum` includes its callees. Here `(*Store).Put` holds 1.18 GB of live data by itself — the retainer. Switch to `inuse_objects` and if a *different* site jumps to the top, you have a many-small problem instead.

> **Key insight:** `inuse_space` finds the whale; `inuse_objects` finds the swarm. Always check both — sorting by bytes alone will miss a leak made of millions of tiny objects, and that swarm is often the one quietly destroying GC pause times.

## Two Snapshots and a Diff — Isolating Growth

A single snapshot tells you what's big *now*. It cannot tell you what's *leaking*, because a large heap can be perfectly healthy (see the next section). The only robust way to find a leak is to take **two snapshots** around a repeatable workload and look at the **delta**. What *grew* is the suspect; what's merely large but stable is noise.

The protocol — identical across runtimes:

1. Drive the app to steady state, then **force a GC** so you compare *settled* heaps, not garbage-in-flight.
2. Take snapshot **A** (the baseline).
3. Run N iterations of the suspect operation (e.g. 10,000 requests through the endpoint you suspect).
4. **Force a GC again** — this is critical: it collects everything that *should* die, so what remains is genuinely retained.
5. Take snapshot **B**.
6. **Diff B against A.** Objects whose count/bytes rose by ~N (or N×k) are the leak; everything flat is irrelevant.

The diff is what makes a leak *obvious*. A type that gained exactly 10,000 instances after 10,000 requests is not a coincidence — it's an object created per request that nothing releases. The tools expose this directly:

- **MAT:** open both heap dumps, use **Compare Basket** (add A, add B, ▣ compare) → a table of retained-size and instance-count deltas per class.
- **Chrome DevTools:** take snapshot, act, take another; switch the selector to **Comparison** → columns **# New**, **# Deleted**, **# Delta**, **Size Delta** per constructor. Sort by `# Delta`.
- **Go:** `go tool pprof -inuse_space -diff_base=heap_A.pb.gz heap_B.pb.gz` — `top` then shows the *growth* per site, not absolute totals.
- **Python:** `snapshot_b.compare_to(snapshot_a, 'lineno')` returns per-line size *differences*, largest first.

> **Key insight:** One snapshot answers "what's big?"; two snapshots answer "what's *growing*?" — and only the second question identifies a leak. Bracket a repeatable workload with GC-forced snapshots and diff them. The delta names the suspect with almost no judgement required.

---

## Leak, Cache, or GC Just Hasn't Run?

Before you declare a leak, rule out the two impostors. High heap usage is *not* the same as a leak, and acting on a false positive wastes days.

**Impostor 1 — the GC simply hasn't run.** A managed runtime grows its heap on purpose; collecting early is wasted work. A sawtooth — heap climbs, GC fires, heap drops, repeat — is *healthy*, even if the peaks are high. You only suspect a leak when the *floor* of the sawtooth (live size right *after* a collection) trends upward over time. This is exactly why the two-snapshot protocol forces a GC before each capture: you compare *post-collection* floors, not pre-collection peaks. Without that forced GC, you'll "find" megabytes of garbage that the next collection would have reclaimed anyway.

**Impostor 2 — a legitimate cache or buffer.** A bounded LRU cache that fills to its limit and stays there is *retaining memory by design*, not leaking. The distinguishing test is **boundedness**: does the retained set *plateau*, or does it grow without limit?

| Signal | True leak | Healthy cache / buffer |
|---|---|---|
| Post-GC live floor over time | rises monotonically | rises then **plateaus** |
| Retained set after long run | unbounded | bounded by cache capacity |
| Diff after N ops, then N more | grows each round | grows once, then flat |
| Has an eviction policy? | no (or broken) | yes, and it fires |

So the real test is never "is the heap big?" It's "does the *floor* keep rising after GC, without bound, as the workload repeats?" If yes, leak. If it plateaus, you have a cache — possibly mis-sized, but not leaking.

> **Key insight:** A leak is *unbounded post-GC growth*, not high usage. Always compare the live floor *after* a forced collection across time. A high but flat floor is a cache; a rising floor is a leak. Confusing the two sends you optimizing healthy memory and ignoring the real one.

---

## The Tools and Their Idioms

Each runtime has one canonical heap tool and a few idioms worth memorizing.

**Go — `go tool pprof`.** Pull a live heap profile from `net/http/pprof`, sort live bytes, drill to source:

```bash
go tool pprof -inuse_space http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
(pprof) top                 # live bytes by site
(pprof) list (*Store).Put   # annotate the source line holding the memory
(pprof) web                 # SVG graph; box size ∝ retained bytes
```
`list` overlays live-byte counts on the actual source, pointing at the exact line that allocates the retained data. `web` renders the retention graph where box area tracks bytes — the visual equivalent of a dominator tree.

**Java — Eclipse MAT** on a `.hprof` dump (`jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.hprof <pid>`; the `live` flag forces a GC first):

- **Dominator Tree** — the heap by retained size; your primary view.
- **Path to GC Roots → exclude weak/soft** — why an object is still alive.
- **Leak Suspects report** — MAT's automated first pass: it clusters the dominator tree and names "one instance of X retains 62%." Often points straight at the culprit; always verify the path yourself.
- **Histogram + Compare Basket** — per-class counts, and A-vs-B diffs.

**Chrome / Node — DevTools heap snapshot** (`.heapsnapshot`):

- **Summary** view grouped by constructor; expand to objects.
- **Retainers** panel (bottom) — walk from a selected object up to a `(GC root)`. This is DevTools' "path to root."
- **Comparison** view — diff two snapshots by `# Delta` / `Size Delta`. The classic detached-DOM leak shows as a growing `Detached HTMLDivElement` count here.

**Python — `tracemalloc`** (snapshots of live allocations, attributed to source lines):

```python
import tracemalloc
tracemalloc.start(25)                 # keep 25 frames of traceback per alloc
snap_a = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
run_workload()
snap_b = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
for stat in snap_b.compare_to(snap_a, 'lineno')[:10]:
    print(stat)
# cache.py:88: size=412 MiB (+412 MiB), count=1048576 (+1048576)
```
`tracemalloc` ties retained bytes to the *line that allocated them*, and `compare_to` gives you the diff directly — the Python analogue of pprof's `-diff_base`.

> **Key insight:** Every tool exposes the same three primitives under different names — retained size (dominator tree / `inuse_space` / Size), path to root (Path to GC Roots / Retainers), and snapshot diff (Compare Basket / Comparison / `-diff_base` / `compare_to`). Learn the *concepts* and each new tool is just relabeled buttons.

## Worked Example — Diffing Two Snapshots to Find the Growing Retainer

**Symptom.** A Go service's RSS climbs ~40 MB/hour under steady traffic and is OOM-killed every two days. CPU and latency are fine. Classic slow leak.

**Step 1 — confirm it's the floor, not the sawtooth.** Grab two heaps an hour apart, each after the GC has run, and diff:

```bash
curl -s localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap_t0.pb.gz
# ... one hour of steady traffic ...
curl -s localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap > heap_t1.pb.gz

go tool pprof -inuse_space -diff_base=heap_t0.pb.gz heap_t1.pb.gz
```
```
(pprof) top
Showing nodes accounting for 39.8MB, 99.1% of 40.2MB total
      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
    39.7MB 98.8% 98.8%     39.7MB 98.8%  acme/events.(*Bus).Subscribe
```
The diff is unambiguous: nearly all *growth* lives at `(*Bus).Subscribe`. Absolute totals would have buried this under steady-state caches; the **delta** isolates it.

**Step 2 — go to the line.**

```bash
(pprof) list (*Bus).Subscribe
```
```
         .          .   41:func (b *Bus) Subscribe(topic string) <-chan Event {
         .          .   42:    ch := make(chan Event, 16)
   39.7MB    39.7MB   43:    b.subs[topic] = append(b.subs[topic], ch)   // <-- grows forever
         .          .   44:    return ch
         .          .   45:}
```
Live bytes are pinned to line 43: every `Subscribe` appends a channel to `b.subs[topic]` and **nothing ever removes it**. There's no `Unsubscribe`, so `b.subs` — reachable from a long-lived `*Bus` — grows without bound. This is the **listener-not-unregistered** retention bug, and `b.subs` is a small-shallow, huge-retained map: the textbook leak shape.

**Step 3 — confirm it's unbounded, not a cache.** Object count over a second hour rises by the same ~40 MB — monotonic, no plateau, no eviction policy. Leak confirmed.

**Step 4 — the cross-check (object count).** Sorting the same diff by `-inuse_objects` shows `(*Bus).Subscribe` topping *both* bytes and count — many channels, each small-ish — confirming a swarm of un-freed subscribers rather than one giant buffer.

**Fix.** Add `Unsubscribe`, remove the channel from the slice on disconnect (swap-and-truncate), and bound retries. **Verify** by repeating the two-snapshot diff after the fix: `(*Bus).Subscribe` no longer appears in `top` — its delta is now ~0. The leak is closed only when the diff says so.

The whole diagnosis — *diff → `list` → confirm unbounded → fix → re-diff* — took four commands and never required guessing. That loop is the entire job.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Sorting by shallow size and chasing the biggest type.** The biggest type is `byte[]`/`String`/`map` *everywhere*; it's rarely the leak. Sort by **retained** size to find the *owner* — the small node that holds the big subtree.

2. **Stopping at "it's big" instead of walking to a root.** Retained size finds the *what*; only the **Path to GC Roots** finds the *why* — and you can't write a fix without the why. Always end on a root.

3. **Diffing snapshots without forcing a GC first.** Without a pre-capture collection you compare heaps full of about-to-die garbage and "find" leaks the next GC would reclaim. Force GC, *then* snapshot — both times.

4. **Calling a bounded cache a leak.** A cache that fills to capacity and *plateaus* is working as designed. The test is **unbounded post-GC growth**, not high usage. Check whether the floor plateaus before declaring a leak.

5. **Sorting only by bytes and missing the swarm.** A leak of millions of tiny objects is modest in `inuse_space` but huge in `inuse_objects`. Check *both* — the swarm is often the one wrecking GC pauses.

6. **Including weak/soft references in the retention path.** Weak and soft references don't keep objects alive, so paths through them aren't real leaks. In MAT, **exclude weak/soft** when computing Path to GC Roots, or you'll chase a non-bug.

7. **Trusting "Leak Suspects" without verifying the path.** MAT's automated report is a great first pointer, but it reports the *dominant retainer*, which for a legitimate large cache is a false alarm. Always confirm with the path and the diff.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Memory Profiling** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Memory Profiling?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
