# Performance Budgets and Regression Testing — Professional

<!-- level-focus -->
At professional level, focus on this question:

> How should teams adopt and operate **Performance Budgets and Regression Testing** with measurable outcomes and limited coordination?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Roadmap:** [Performance](../README.md) → Performance Budgets and Regression Testing
> *The senior page taught you to write a stable benchmark and pick a statistical threshold. This page is about running that machinery as org-wide governance — who owns the budget, who gets paged when it breaks, why half the benchmarks get muted within a year, and how you justify a six-figure runner fleet against incidents nobody can see because they never happened.*

## Making Budgets Stick Organizationally

A budget that isn't *owned* isn't a budget — it's a number in a wiki. The single most common failure mode of performance governance is a beautifully instrumented dashboard that nobody is accountable for, breaching quietly for months.

Three things have to be true for a budget to have teeth:

**1. It has a named owner, not a team alias.**
- "The platform team owns the search-latency budget" decays into nobody owning it. Assign budgets to a person (with a backup), the same way you assign service ownership.
- The owner's job isn't to *never regress* — it's to *know the current state and drive the decision* when a regression lands.

**2. A breach has a defined consequence and a defined responder.**
- Without this, a red dashboard is wallpaper. The consequence is a spectrum (see [Blocking Gate vs Non-Blocking Alert vs Trend-Only](#blocking-gate-vs-non-blocking-alert-vs-trend-only)), but *someone specific* must be on the hook to respond.
- The model that works: the **regression is attributed to the offending PR**, and the PR author — not the budget owner — is the first responder. The author has the context; the budget owner escalates if the author can't.

**3. Changing the budget requires sign-off, not a quiet edit.**
- The moment a budget becomes uncomfortable, the path of least resistance is to bump the number. If anyone can edit `latency_budget_ms: 200` → `250` in a config file and merge it, the budget is fiction.
- Gate budget changes behind a lightweight RFC:

```markdown
# RFC: Raise checkout-service p99 budget 180ms → 220ms

## Current state
p99 budget: 180ms (set 2024-Q1). Breached by the new fraud-scoring call.

## Proposed change
Raise to 220ms.

## Why this is the right tradeoff
Fraud scoring blocks $1.2M/yr in chargebacks. The 40ms is a synchronous
ML call; async rework is ~6 weeks. We accept the latency now and track
the async migration as PERF-4471 (target Q3).

## Alternatives considered
- Async the call now: +6wk, delays fraud rollout. Rejected for timing.
- Cache scores: 30% hit rate in spike test, insufficient. Deferred.

## Sign-off
- [ ] Budget owner (latency): @asha
- [ ] Service owner (checkout): @diego
- [ ] Eng director (accepts the regression on record): @priya
```

- The RFC does two things: it makes the cost *visible* (a director's name is on accepting 40ms of permanent latency), and it creates an audit trail so the budget's history is a record of deliberate decisions, not entropy.
- The friction is the point — it should be slightly annoying to widen a budget, exactly as annoying as it is to widen an SLO.

> **The professional reality:** budgets don't fail because the threshold math is wrong. They fail because no one is accountable, breaches have no consequence, and the number can be edited away under deadline pressure. Fix the org design first; the statistics were never the bottleneck.

## Performance Budgets as SLOs and Error Budgets

The cleanest mental upgrade at this tier is to stop treating a performance budget as a pass/fail line and start treating it as an **SLO with an error budget** — the same construct SRE uses for availability.

- A naive budget says "p99 checkout latency must be ≤ 200ms." Brittle: a single spike trips it, and a sustained 201ms is treated the same as a sustained 400ms.
- The SLO formulation is richer:
  - **SLI (indicator):** the measured quantity — p99 checkout latency over a rolling 28-day window.
  - **SLO (objective):** "99% of 1-minute windows have p99 ≤ 200ms."
  - **Error budget:** the allowed 1% of windows that may exceed it — roughly 7 hours/month of being over budget.

Now a regression isn't binary — it *burns error budget*. A small regression burns slowly; a large one burns fast. Alert on the **burn rate**, giving the same elegant escalation SRE uses:

```yaml
# Multi-window burn-rate alerts for a latency SLO (concept)
- alert: PerfBudgetFastBurn
  # Burning a month of budget in ~2 days → page now
  expr: latency_budget_burn_rate_1h > 14 and latency_budget_burn_rate_5m > 14
  severity: page
- alert: PerfBudgetSlowBurn
  # Burning steadily → ticket, look at it this week
  expr: latency_budget_burn_rate_6h > 3 and latency_budget_burn_rate_1h > 3
  severity: ticket
```

- The error-budget framing unlocks the organizational lever that makes budgets *negotiable in a healthy way*: **when the error budget is exhausted, feature work that risks latency stops until the budget is recovered.** That's the SRE freeze, applied to performance.
- It converts "performance vs features" from a recurring argument into a pre-agreed policy. Teams don't litigate it every sprint; they agreed once that an exhausted budget halts risky merges.

> **The link that matters:** a performance budget *is* a latency SLO measured pre-production (in CI/benchmarks) and validated post-production (in [RUM](#the-production-feedback-loop--rum-and-canaries-as-ground-truth)). The CI benchmark is your *leading* indicator; the production SLO is your *ground-truth* indicator. They should agree; when they diverge, your benchmark is lying to you (see [Latency and Throughput](../latency-and-throughput/professional.md) for why lab p99 and prod p99 drift).

## The Continuous-Benchmarking Platform as Infrastructure

At one engineer's scale, "continuous benchmarking" is a CI job that runs `go test -bench` and posts a comment. At org scale it's *infrastructure* — a system with the same operational weight as your metrics stack, and it has four components that you will build or buy whether you plan to or not.

**1. A dedicated runner fleet.** The non-negotiable foundation, and the most common thing teams get wrong. Shared CI runners are *noisy*: they share CPUs with other jobs, have variable thermal state, and live on cloud instances with stolen cycles and noisy neighbors. You need **dedicated, isolated, identical hardware**:

- Bare-metal or pinned dedicated instances — no neighbors, no CPU steal.
- Fixed CPU frequency: disable turbo/boost, pin the governor to `performance`, so a result doesn't depend on thermal luck.
- `taskset`/cgroup pinning to isolated cores; `isolcpus` to keep the OS scheduler off them.
- The *same* machine model for every run, forever — comparing across hardware generations silently corrupts the time series.

```bash
# A perf-runner pre-flight, run before every benchmark batch
cpupower frequency-set -g performance
echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost          # kill turbo variance
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
taskset -c 4-7 ./run-benchmarks --warmup 5 --iterations 30
```

- A pragmatic fleet for a mid-size org is small — often 4–10 machines — because benchmark runs are serialized per machine to avoid contention. The fleet's *value* is consistency, not throughput.

**2. A result store / time-series database.** Every benchmark result, tagged with commit SHA, machine ID, and full environment fingerprint, written to a queryable store. This is what turns "is this PR slower?" into "is this metric trending up over the last 200 commits?" Go's perf dashboard, Perfherder, and Chromium's dashboard are all, at heart, this store plus a UI.

**3. A dashboard with per-metric time series and commit annotations.** The killer feature is **attribution**: every point on the graph links to the commit that produced it, so a step-change in the line points straight at the offending SHA. This is what makes a sheriff's job possible.

**4. Alerting with automatic attribution to the offending PR/commit.** When a metric steps, the system shouldn't just fire — it should identify *which commit* caused it and ideally *auto-bisect* the range to a single SHA, then file a bug assigned to that author. This is the part that separates a toy from Chromium's setup:

```json
{
  "alert": "regression",
  "metric": "browser.startup_time_p95",
  "magnitude": "+9.2% (412ms → 450ms)",
  "confidence": "p < 0.001, 30 runs each side",
  "bisected_to": "a1b9f3c",
  "author": "@kira",
  "auto_action": "filed BUG-8842, assigned @kira, snoozed gate to alert-only for this metric pending triage"
}
```

> **The build-vs-buy reality:** small teams should *buy or adopt* (`bencher.dev`, Codspeed, language-native dashboards) before building. Building the full Chromium-grade platform — fleet, store, bisector, sheriff tooling — is a multi-quarter infra project justified only when benchmark coverage is core to the product (a browser, a database, a language runtime). Most orgs need 10% of Chromium's machinery; building 100% of it is a classic over-investment.

## Blocking Gate vs Non-Blocking Alert vs Trend-Only

The single most consequential design decision in performance governance is *what happens when a check goes red*. Get this wrong and you either grind PRs to a halt with flaky gates (and lose trust) or fire alerts nobody reads (and catch nothing). There are three response levels, and the skill is matching each metric to the right one.

| Response | What it does | Use for | Failure mode if misused |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Blocking gate** | Red blocks the merge | User-facing latency budgets; binary-size budgets; a small set of golden macro-benchmarks | A flaky gate trains everyone to re-run until green, then it catches nothing |
| **Non-blocking alert** | Red posts a comment / pings a channel, merge proceeds | Micro-benchmark suites; per-component timings; anything with > ~2% run-to-run noise | Alert fatigue → muted channel → invisible regressions |
| **Trend-only** | No per-PR verdict; watched as a time series, sheriff investigates steps | Noisy metrics; metrics with no clean per-PR signal; broad coverage suites | None for trust, but slow detection (a sheriff has to look) |

- The governing principle: **block only what is (a) genuinely user-facing and (b) stable enough that a red verdict is almost always real.** A blocking gate's credibility is its entire value, and credibility is destroyed by a single percentage of false positives. If a gate cries wolf even 3% of the time on a busy repo, engineers learn the ritual "regression? just re-run it" — and the next time it fires on a *real* 2x regression, they re-run that too, and ship it.

The mapping that works in practice:

- **Block** on a handful of curated, rock-stable, user-facing budgets: end-to-end page-load p95, API latency budget, bundle size, cold-start time. These should be macro-benchmarks or production-shaped scenarios with noise well under the regression you care about.
- **Alert** on the broad micro-benchmark suite — the hundreds of `BenchmarkX` functions. Valuable as a trend and for attribution, but per-PR blocking on a noisy micro-bench is pure friction. Post a comment, don't block.
- **Trend-only** for the long tail — exploratory metrics, third-party-dependent timings, anything you haven't yet earned the right to gate on.

> **The migration path:** a metric *earns* its way up the ladder. New metrics start trend-only. Once they're stable for a quarter and clearly tied to user experience, promote them to alert. Only after they've proven they fire true positives do you promote to a blocking gate. Demote instantly the moment a gate produces a false positive that wastes the team's time — a blocking gate that has lost trust is worse than no gate.

## The Human Side — Sheriffs, Triage, and Trust

Automated detection is half the system. The other half is a *human workflow* that turns a fired alert into a closed regression — and a *trust budget* that, once spent, is brutally hard to recover.

**The sheriff rotation.** Borrowed directly from Chromium and Mozilla: a rotating role (a week at a time) whose job is to watch the performance dashboards and triage every regression alert.
- The sheriff isn't expected to *fix* regressions — they're a dispatcher. The rotation spreads the load and the knowledge, and crucially it means *someone is always looking*.
- Without a named sheriff, dashboards rot; everyone assumes someone else is watching.

**The triage workflow.** A good system does most of this automatically and leaves the sheriff the judgment calls:

```
Alert fires (metric stepped, p < 0.001)
   │
   ▼
Auto-bisect the commit range  ──► single offending SHA
   │
   ▼
Auto-file a bug, assign to the commit author, link the dashboard
   │
   ▼  (sheriff reviews)
   ├─ Real & expected (we accepted this in an RFC)  → close, annotate budget
   ├─ Real & unexpected                              → confirm assignment, set severity
   ├─ Real but tiny / not worth it                   → file as low-pri or wontfix
   └─ Not real (flaky benchmark / infra blip)        → MUTE the benchmark, file a fix-the-bench bug
```

- The last branch is the most important and the most neglected. **Flaky benchmarks are the cancer of a perf program.** A benchmark that fires false alarms doesn't just waste the sheriff's time — it teaches everyone that perf alerts are noise.
- The discipline that keeps the system alive: *a benchmark that produces a false positive is muted immediately and treated as broken until fixed.* It does not get to keep crying wolf while someone "gets around to" stabilizing it.

> **Trust is the real currency.** Every false positive — a flaky gate, a noisy alert, a regression bug filed against an innocent commit — withdraws from a trust account. When the balance hits zero, engineers route around the entire system, and you're back to shipping regressions blind. Protect trust ruthlessly: fewer, more-reliable signals beat broad, noisy coverage every time. A perf program's health is measured not by how many benchmarks it runs but by how often its alerts are *believed*.

---

## The Production-Feedback Loop — RUM and Canaries as Ground Truth

Every benchmark is a model of reality, and every model is wrong somewhere. The CI suite runs on pristine hardware with synthetic inputs; production runs on whatever the customer has, under real traffic shapes, with cache states and contention the lab never reproduces. The professional posture treats **production as the ground-truth budget** and the lab as a leading indicator that must be validated against it.

**Real-user monitoring (RUM).**
- For anything user-facing, the budget that *actually matters* is the latency real users experience — Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) from real browsers for frontend, prod p99/p999 from your APM for backend. RUM is the ultimate budget because it's denominated in the only units that count: user experience.
- Your CI benchmark should *track* RUM, not replace it. When the lab says "no regression" but RUM p99 climbs, the lab is unrepresentative — wrong inputs, wrong hardware mix, wrong concurrency — and that divergence is itself a high-value signal that your benchmark needs fixing.

**Canary performance comparison.** The highest-leverage regression catch happens *between* CI and full rollout: the canary. Before a build reaches 100% of traffic, route a small slice (1–5%) to it and statistically compare the canary's performance against the stable fleet on identical, *real* traffic:

```
Canary analysis — build a1b9f3c, 5% traffic, 30-min window
  metric          stable      canary      delta     verdict
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  p50 latency     42ms        43ms        +2.4%     PASS
  p99 latency     180ms       361ms       +101%     FAIL  ◄── 2x regression
  error rate      0.02%       0.02%       —         PASS
  cpu / req       8.1ms       8.3ms       +2.5%     PASS
  → AUTOMATED ROLLBACK: p99 breach > 20% threshold. Build held at 5%.
```

- The canary catches what no lab benchmark can: regressions that only manifest under *real* traffic distribution, *real* cache behavior, and *real* data sizes.
- It's an apples-to-apples comparison (same time, same traffic, same hardware) and it gates the rollout, not the merge — so it can be strict without slowing PR velocity.
- A canary that auto-rolls-back on a p99 breach is the strongest single safeguard in the entire apparatus, because it sits at the last gate before users feel the pain.

> **The three-layer defense:** CI benchmarks (fast, cheap, leading, but unrepresentative) → canary comparison (slower, real traffic, gates rollout) → RUM/prod SLO (ground truth, but lagging). No single layer is sufficient. CI catches the obvious early; canary catches the production-only; RUM tells you whether the whole system is actually keeping its promise. Tune your investment so the cheap layers catch most regressions and the expensive ground-truth layer is the backstop, not the primary detector.

## Cost and ROI of the Apparatus

Eventually someone with a budget asks: *why does performance testing cost six figures a year?* You need an answer that isn't "trust me, it's important."

**The cost side is concrete:**

- **Runner fleet:** 6 dedicated bare-metal machines ≈ $1.5–3k/month hardware or reserved-instance equivalent → ~$25–35k/year. Plus the engineer-time to keep them identical and healthy.
- **Platform engineering:** building/operating the store, dashboard, and bisector — easily 0.5–1 FTE if self-built (the strongest argument for buying).
- **Sheriff time:** one engineer-week per rotation cycle, spread across the team — real, recurring opportunity cost.
- **PR friction:** every false positive costs the whole team minutes-to-hours of re-runs and investigation. This is the *hidden* cost that destroys ROI if flakiness isn't controlled.

**The value side is harder to see because it's counterfactual** — the regressions that *didn't* ship. To make it visible, instrument the wins:

- **Count caught regressions and estimate their blast radius.** "The canary caught a 2x p99 regression that would have hit 100% of checkout traffic; at our conversion sensitivity (~1% revenue per 100ms), a sustained 180ms regression is ~$X/day." A single caught checkout or search regression often pays for the fleet for a year.
- **Track the alternative cost: perf incidents.** A regression that ships becomes an incident — on-call hours, customer impact, an emergency rollback, a postmortem. Tally incidents *avoided* (caught pre-prod) against incidents *that slipped*. A program that catches 10 real regressions a year and lets 1 slip has an obvious ROI story.
- **Frame it as insurance, priced by exposure.** A browser, a database, or a high-traffic checkout flow has enormous performance exposure; a low-traffic internal tool has almost none. The apparatus should be sized to the exposure. Spending Chromium money to guard an internal admin panel is malpractice; spending nothing to guard a billion-user product is negligence.

> **The honest ROI conversation:** the apparatus is insurance against expensive, hard-to-detect, slow-to-roll-back regressions. Its cost is visible and recurring; its value is invisible and counterfactual. Win the argument by *instrumenting the catches* — make the avoided incidents and the prevented revenue loss a number on a slide — and by *right-sizing to exposure* so you're never defending Chromium-scale spend on a low-stakes service.

---

## Decision Frameworks

**Should this metric be a blocking gate, an alert, or trend-only? Ask:**
- Is it genuinely user-facing (latency, bundle size, cold start)? If no → alert or trend-only, never block.
- Is its run-to-run noise comfortably smaller than the regression I care about? If no → fix the noise first, or alert/trend-only.
- Has it produced a false positive in the last quarter? If yes → demote until it's reliable.
- New metric with no track record? → start trend-only and let it earn promotion.

**Who responds to a breach? Default to:**
- First responder = the **PR author** the regression is attributed to (they have the context).
- Escalation = the **named budget owner** (drives the decision if the author can't).
- Sign-off to *change* the budget = service owner + budget owner + a director on record.

**Should we build or buy the platform? Ask:**
- Is benchmark coverage core to the product (browser/DB/runtime)? → building the full fleet+store+bisector may be justified.
- Otherwise → buy/adopt (`bencher.dev`, Codspeed, language dashboards). You need ~10% of Chromium's machinery.

**How much should we spend? Size to exposure:**
- High traffic × high latency-sensitivity (checkout, search, a browser) → invest in the full three-layer defense incl. canary auto-rollback.
- Low traffic / low stakes (internal tool) → trend-only dashboard, no fleet, no sheriff.

**A regression alert fired — first question:**
- Is it *real*? If flaky → **mute the benchmark now** and file a fix-the-bench bug. Never let a known-flaky benchmark keep firing.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Budgets with no owner, no consequence, and an editable number.** The bundle creeps to 900 KB one PR at a time. Assign a named owner, define a breach consequence, and gate budget changes behind an RFC with sign-off.
2. **Blocking merges on noisy micro-benchmarks.** A few percent of false failures trains everyone to re-run until green, then the gate catches nothing and eventually gets deleted. Block only stable user-facing metrics; alert on micro-benches.
3. **Tolerating flaky benchmarks instead of muting them.** Every false alarm drains the trust account. Mute on the first false positive and fix the bench; a known-flaky benchmark that keeps firing is actively harmful.
4. **Running benchmarks on shared CI runners.** Noisy neighbors and CPU steal produce noise that dwarfs real regressions. A dedicated, frequency-pinned, isolated fleet is the foundation, not an optimization.
5. **Trusting the lab over production.** Synthetic inputs and pristine hardware miss production-scale, real-traffic regressions. Validate against RUM and gate rollout with a canary; treat lab-vs-prod divergence as a benchmark bug.
6. **No attribution / no auto-bisect.** "Something regressed in the last 200 commits" is nearly useless under deadline. Tag every result with the SHA, annotate the dashboard, and auto-bisect to a single commit and author.
7. **Defending the apparatus's cost with vibes.** "It's important" loses to a spreadsheet. Instrument the catches — count avoided incidents and prevented revenue loss, and size spend to the service's exposure.
8. **No sheriff / no rotation.** Dashboards rot when everyone assumes someone else is watching. A named, rotating sheriff guarantees someone is always triaging.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Performance Budgets and Regression Testing** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Performance Budgets and Regression Testing?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
- The perf gate is flaky and has blocked three legitimate PRs this week, and the team wants to turn it off — what do you do?
- When do you make a perf check blocking, alerting, or trend-only? Give the decision rule.
- Would you build automatic bisection for performance regressions? What's the trade-off?
- When synthetic benchmarks can never perfectly represent production, where does ground truth actually come from?
- How do you justify the ROI of a perf-regression program when it has a real ongoing cost?
- Two benchmarks regressed and three improved in the same PR — how do you read that?
