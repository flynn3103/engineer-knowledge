# The Craftsman's Ethics & Oath — Middle

> **Category:** [Craftsmanship Disciplines](../README.md) — the professional and ethical commitments that separate a software craftsman from someone who merely types code that compiles.

> **Prerequisite:** [Junior](junior.md)
> **Focus:** **What each promise actually means** and **how the manifestos relate**

## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** each promise exists and **when** it bites.

At the junior level the Oath was a list to recognize and the manifesto was a slogan to understand. At the middle level you treat each promise as a *concrete engineering practice with a cost and a reason*, and you can explain exactly how the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto extends — not replaces — the Agile Manifesto.

The recurring middle-level skill is **translating a principle into a practice**. "Do your best work" is a platitude until you can say: *it means a test for every behavior, a name that explains itself, and no commented-out code left in the file.* This file does that translation for all nine promises and all four manifesto lines.

## The Programmer's Oath, Promise by Promise

Robert C. Martin's Oath is usually rendered as nine numbered promises (some printings group them differently). Below is each one, what it *concretely* obligates you to do, and the practice or discipline that delivers it.

### Promise 1 — I will not produce harmful code

> *"I will not produce harmful code."*

The baseline, mirroring "first, do no harm." Harm here is broad: harm to **users** (a bug that loses their money or leaks their data), harm to **society** (software that deceives, discriminates, or endangers), and harm to **other programmers** (code so bad it sabotages the next person's work). The Oath explicitly counts bad code itself as a form of harm, because unmaintainable code damages everyone who must touch it.

**Practice:** threat-think before shipping anything touching money, identity, safety, or data. Ask *who could this hurt, and how?*

### Promise 2 — The code I produce will always be my best work

> *"I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate."*

Two kinds of defect: **behavioral** (it does the wrong thing) and **structural** (it's tangled, duplicated, badly named — it works but it rots). Crucially, the word is *knowingly*: you will make mistakes, but you will not *deliberately* let known rot pile up. This is the death of "I'll clean it up later" as an excuse.

**Practice:** the Boy Scout Rule, continuous refactoring, code review. See [Simple Design](../04-simple-design/junior.md).

### Promise 3 — I will provide a quick, sure, repeatable proof that every element works

> *"I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should."*

This is the promise that *forces* automated testing. "Quick" rules out manual QA as the only safety net; "sure" rules out flaky tests; "repeatable" rules out "it worked when I tried it." The phrase "every element" is demanding — it's the aspiration behind high test coverage and TDD.

**Practice:** automated tests, run on every release, ideally written test-first. See [The Three Laws of TDD](../01-the-three-laws-of-tdd/junior.md).

### Promise 4 — I will make frequent, small releases

> *"I will make frequent, small releases so that I do not impede the progress of others."*

Small batches are an ethical position, not just a process preference. A small release that breaks is **cheap to diagnose and reverse**; a giant quarterly release that breaks is a manhunt. Frequent integration also means you are never secretly diverging from your teammates for weeks.

**Practice:** continuous integration, small pull requests, trunk-based or short-lived branches, feature flags.

### Promise 5 — I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations

> *"I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them."*

The two halves matter. *Fearlessly* improve — and you can only refactor without fear if promise 3 (the test suite) is kept, because the tests catch you when a refactor breaks something. *Never degrade* — every change should leave the design at least as clean. Code that everyone is afraid to touch is a failure of this promise.

**Practice:** refactoring as a continuous discipline, backed by tests. See [Refactoring as a Discipline](../03-refactoring-as-a-discipline/junior.md).

### Promise 6 — I will keep productivity high

> *"I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity."*

This reframes the previous promises as a *team* obligation. Shipping a hack that slows everyone else down violates this even if it sped *you* up. So does breaking the build, leaving the CI pipeline red, or merging code that forces everyone to work around your mess.

**Practice:** keep the build green, keep the suite fast, keep shared code clean, don't optimize your output at the team's expense.

### Promise 7 — I will ensure others can cover for me, and I for them

> *"I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them."*

The anti-hero promise. A bus factor of one — where one person is the only one who understands a system — is a liability you inflict on the team and the business. Being indispensable is not a virtue; it is a single point of failure with a salary.

**Practice:** knowledge-sharing, collective code ownership, documentation of the non-obvious, pairing. See [Pair & Mob Programming](../05-pair-and-mob-programming/junior.md).

### Promise 8 — I will produce estimates that are honest

> *"I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty."*

Estimation honesty cuts **both ways**. Padding an estimate to give yourself slack is dishonest; shrinking it to please a manager is dishonest. "Honest in precision" is subtle: if you genuinely don't know, the honest answer is a *range* or "I need to spike this first," not a confident single number you don't believe. A professional refuses to make a commitment they have no basis for keeping.

**Practice:** ranges over point estimates, "three-point" estimates (best/likely/worst), spikes for unknowns, and saying "I don't know yet" out loud.

### Promise 9 — I will never stop learning and improving my craft

> *"I will never stop learning and improving my craft."*

The half-life of a software skill is short. A professional treats continuous learning as part of the job description, not a hobby. This promise is what keeps the other eight alive as the field changes.

**Practice:** deliberate practice, katas, reading, conferences, learning from code review. See [Kata & Deliberate Practice](../07-kata-and-deliberate-practice/junior.md).

### A summary table

| # | Promise | Delivered by | Violated when you... |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Do no harm | Threat-thinking, care | ship a known-dangerous feature |
| 2 | Best work, no defects allowed to accumulate | Refactoring, review | knowingly leave rot "for later" |
| 3 | Quick, sure, repeatable proof | Automated tests / TDD | ship with no tests and "hope" |
| 4 | Frequent small releases | CI, small PRs | sit on a giant branch for weeks |
| 5 | Fearlessly improve, never degrade | Refactoring + tests | leave code worse, or fear to touch it |
| 6 | Keep productivity high | Green build, clean shared code | speed yourself up by slowing the team |
| 7 | Others can cover for me | Knowledge sharing, pairing | hoard knowledge, become a hero |
| 8 | Honest estimates | Ranges, spikes, candor | pad or shrink to manage feelings |
| 9 | Never stop learning | Deliberate practice | coast on yesterday's skills |

## The Two Halves of the Oath

A useful way to remember the Oath is that it splits cleanly:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Promises about the CODE (1-5)"
        P1[1. Do no harm]
        P2[2. Best work]
        P3[3. Prove it works]
        P4[4. Ship small & often]
        P5[5. Relentlessly improve]
    end
    subgraph "Promises about YOU & the TEAM (6-9)"
        P6[6. Keep productivity high]
        P7[7. Be coverable / replaceable]
        P8[8. Estimate honestly]
        P9[9. Never stop learning]
    end
```

The first half is about the *artifact* you produce. The second half is about the *professional* you are. A surprising number of mid-career developers are strong on 1–5 and weak on 6–9 — they write clean, tested code but hoard knowledge, estimate to please, or stop learning. The Oath insists you owe both.

## The Craftsmanship Manifesto vs the Agile Manifesto

The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto (2009) is consciously built as a **second layer on top of** the Agile Manifesto (2001). Each craftsmanship line takes an Agile value and adds a quality dimension to it.

### The Agile Manifesto (for reference)

> We value:
> - Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools
> - Working software **over** comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation
> - Responding to change **over** following a plan
>
> *That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.*

### The Craftsmanship Manifesto, mapped

> *Not only working software, but also well-crafted software.*
> *Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value.*
> *Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals.*
> *Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships.*

| Agile value (2001) | Craftsmanship extension (2009) | What the extension fixes |
|---|---|---|
| Working software | **Well-crafted software** | "Working" tolerated untested, unmaintainable code; craftsmanship demands quality *as well*. |
| Responding to change | **Steadily adding value** | Reacting to change isn't enough; you must consistently *improve* the product and the codebase, not just patch it. |
| Individuals and interactions | **A community of professionals** | Beyond a single team's interactions: mentor, share, raise the whole field's bar. |
| Customer collaboration | **Productive partnerships** | Don't just "collaborate"; build a genuine, mutually-accountable partnership where you advise honestly, including saying no. |

### The crucial structural difference

The Agile Manifesto uses **"over"** — it picks the left over the right, but explicitly says the right still has value. The Craftsmanship Manifesto uses **"not only … but also"** — it *keeps* the left and *adds* the right. It is purely additive.

This is the most-tested distinction at the middle level: **craftsmanship does not say "well-crafted instead of working."** It says "working is not enough on its own; also make it well-crafted." Working software remains essential — a beautiful codebase that doesn't solve the user's problem is still a failure.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    AG["Agile: 'A over B'<br/>(prefer A, B still has value)"] --> CR["Craftsmanship: 'not only B, also A'<br/>(keep B, add A)"]
    CR --> W["Working software is the FLOOR;<br/>well-crafted is the standard"]
```

---

## What "Well-Crafted" Actually Means

"Well-crafted" is the manifesto's central new word, so it deserves a concrete definition. A well-crafted system is one that is:

| Property | Concretely |
|---|---|
| **Correct** | It does what the user needs — working software is still the prerequisite. |
| **Tested** | Behavior is pinned by a fast, reliable, automated suite (Oath promise 3). |
| **Readable** | The next developer understands it without archaeology; names and structure tell the story. |
| **Changeable** | You can add a feature or fix a bug without fear, because the design and tests support it (promise 5). |
| **Simple** | No accidental complexity, no speculative generality, no dead code. See [Simple Design](../04-simple-design/junior.md). |
| **Honest** | The code does what it appears to do; no hidden surprises, no misleading abstractions. |

The litmus test: **a well-crafted system is one a stranger can safely change six months after you've left.** "Working" is a statement about today; "well-crafted" is a statement about every tomorrow. The gap between the two is exactly the technical debt you'll carry — and the senior level treats that debt as an ethical, not merely technical, issue.

---

## The Oath's Limits and Criticisms

A middle-level professional should hold the Oath thoughtfully, not religiously. Honest criticisms:

- **It is not officially adopted.** No licensing body backs it. It carries moral, not legal, weight. (The senior level discusses the ACM/IEEE codes, which *are* formally adopted.)
- **It can read as absolutist.** "Always my best work" and "never degrade" collide with real deadlines and triage. The mature reading is *aspirational direction*, not a rule that fails you on the first hotfix.
- **It centers the individual, not the system.** Many failures are *organizational* — the lone heroic programmer keeping the Oath inside a dysfunctional company can still be overruled. Ethics needs structural support, not just personal virtue.
- **"Do no harm" is hard to operationalize.** Harm is often diffuse and indirect (recommendation algorithms, surveillance). The Oath gives you the *obligation* to think about it, not an *answer*.

Holding these criticisms in mind is itself professional maturity: the Oath is a *compass*, not a *contract*. It points; it does not absolve.

## Putting the Promises Into Daily Practice

The promises become real only as habits. A concrete mapping:

- **Before you code:** Is this harmful? (1) Do I understand it well enough to estimate honestly? (8)
- **As you code:** Am I writing a test for this behavior? (3) Is this my best, or am I knowingly leaving rot? (2)
- **As you commit:** Is this a small, safe increment? (4) Did I leave it cleaner than I found it? (2, 5)
- **As you review others' code:** Am I helping keep team productivity and quality high? (6) Am I sharing knowledge both ways? (7)
- **Each week:** Did I learn something deliberately? (9) Is anyone (including me) becoming a single point of failure? (7)

---

## Trade-offs

| Dimension | Keeping the promise | Breaking it "just this once" |
|---|---|---|
| Promise 3 (tests) | Slower first commit, fast & safe forever after | Fast now; every future change is a gamble |
| Promise 4 (small releases) | More release ceremony, cheaper failures | Fewer releases, catastrophic failures |
| Promise 7 (coverability) | Time spent sharing, resilient team | "Indispensable" feeling, fragile team |
| Promise 8 (honest estimates) | Awkward conversations now | Comfortable now, broken trust at the deadline |

The pattern is identical across every row, and it is the central lesson of the topic: **the promise trades a small, visible, short-term cost for a large, invisible, long-term gain.** Breaking it does the reverse. Most professional failures are not malice — they are someone repeatedly choosing the comfortable short-term side of this table.

---

## Common Misreadings

1. **"Craftsmanship means gold-plating."** No. Promise 4 (small releases) and Simple Design both push *against* over-engineering. Well-crafted ≠ over-built.
2. **"The manifesto rejects Agile."** No — it's "not only … but also." It is additive; it keeps every Agile value.
3. **"Honest estimate means a precise estimate."** The opposite. Honesty about *precision* often means giving a *range* or admitting uncertainty.
4. **"Do no harm only applies to safety-critical code."** Harmful code includes unmaintainable code that harms the next programmer — promise 1 covers ordinary CRUD apps too.
5. **"The Oath is enforceable."** It is a personal commitment with moral weight, not a regulated standard.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Learn the promises as practices, not slogans.** Be able to name the discipline that delivers each one.
2. **Audit yourself on promises 6–9, not just 1–5.** Clean code is the easy half; being honest, replaceable, and still learning is the hard half.
3. **Use "not only … but also" as your craftsmanship test.** Did this change *add value* and stay *well-crafted*, not just respond to a ticket?
4. **Estimate in ranges with stated assumptions.** It is the most-violated promise and the easiest to fix.
5. **Hold the Oath as a compass, not a cudgel.** Apply it to your own conduct, with humility, not as a stick to beat colleagues with.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Which Oath promise forces automated testing, and what do its words "quick, sure, repeatable" each rule out?
2. Why is making frequent, small releases an *ethical* position and not just a process choice?
3. What is the structural difference between the Agile Manifesto's "over" and the Craftsmanship Manifesto's "not only … but also"?
4. Promise 8 says estimates must be honest "in magnitude and precision." What does honesty about *precision* actually require?
5. Give two legitimate criticisms of the Programmer's Oath.

---

## Summary

- Each Oath promise is a **concrete practice with a cost and a reason**, not a slogan — tests, small releases, refactoring, knowledge-sharing, honest estimates, continuous learning.
- The Oath splits into promises **about the code** (1–5) and **about you and your team** (6–9); most people are stronger on the first half.
- The Craftsmanship Manifesto extends Agile with **"not only … but also"** — it is **additive**, not a replacement; working software stays essential.
- **"Well-crafted"** means correct *and* tested, readable, changeable, simple, and honest — safely modifiable by a stranger after you're gone.
- The Oath is a **compass, not a contract**: aspirational, not officially enforced, and best held with humility.
