## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — what the three laws cost and protect once a whole team lives by them, under CI, with managers reading dashboards.

A solo developer can follow the three laws on willpower. A 200-engineer org cannot — at that scale the laws become a question of **incentives, gates, and culture**. The professional questions are operational:

- How does the inner loop interact with **CI/CD** and a multi-tier test suite?
- Why does **coverage as a target** corrupt the very value TDD provides, and what to measure instead?
- How do you apply test-first to **legacy code** that has no seams?
- What **review standards** keep tests honest across hundreds of contributors?
- How do you **roll out** TDD without triggering the revolt that kills most quality initiatives?

---

## TDD in CI/CD

The three laws run on the developer's machine in seconds. CI runs the *accumulated* suite on every push in minutes. The two must stay aligned, or the inner loop and the gate diverge.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DEV["Dev machine:<br/>nano-cycle (sec)<br/>3 laws"] --> COMMIT["commit / push"]
    COMMIT --> CI1["CI: unit tests (fast)<br/>fail → block merge"]
    CI1 --> CI2["CI: integration tests (slower)"]
    CI2 --> CI3["CI: acceptance/e2e (slowest)"]
    CI3 --> MERGE["merge to main"]
```

Operational rules:

- **The fast unit tests gate every merge and must stay green on `main`.** A red `main` halts the whole team; treat it as a stop-the-line event.
- **Keep the unit tier brutally fast** (seconds for the whole module, low minutes for the repo). If unit tests need a database, they're not unit tests — they belong in the integration tier. A slow unit tier silently destroys the nano-cycle: developers stop running tests locally, and TDD dies.
- **Run the full suite pre-merge; run slow e2e suites post-merge or nightly** if they can't fit the PR budget — but never let "it's slow" become "we skip it."
- **Flaky tests are a sev event.** One flaky test in a gating suite trains the whole team to ignore red, which is fatal to the discipline. Quarantine and fix flakes aggressively.

## The Test Pyramid and Where the Laws Live

The three laws operate at the **base** of the test pyramid — fast, isolated unit tests. Knowing the whole pyramid prevents the classic failure of "100% unit coverage, system still broken."

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E2E["E2E / UI<br/>few, slow, brittle"] --> INT
    INT["Integration / contract<br/>some, medium"] --> UNIT
    UNIT["Unit<br/>many, fast — THE 3 LAWS LIVE HERE"]
    style UNIT fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
```

| Tier | Speed | Count | Driven by the 3 laws? |
|------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| Unit | ms | thousands | **Yes** — this is the inner loop |
| Integration / contract | 10s–100s ms | hundreds | Partially (test-first, but not nano-cycle) |
| Acceptance / E2E | seconds+ | tens | Outer loop ([ATDD](../06-acceptance-test-driven-development/junior.md)), not the three laws |

The professional mistake is letting the pyramid invert into an "ice cream cone" — mostly slow E2E tests, few unit tests — which makes the inner loop impossible and pushes feedback latency from seconds to tens of minutes. The three laws are only sustainable on a healthy pyramid with a fat, fast unit base.

## Coverage Politics

Coverage is the most abused metric in testing, and TDD's relationship to it is widely misunderstood.

**The truth:** TDD produces high coverage as a **side effect** — every line was written to pass a test, so nearly every line is covered. But the value was the *test-first design and trust*, not the number.

**The corruption (Goodhart's Law):** *"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."* The moment management mandates "90% coverage," engineers hit 90% by the cheapest path — usually **test-after, assertion-light tests** that execute lines without verifying behavior. You get the number and lose the value. Coverage measures what code *ran during tests*, not whether *anything was checked*.

```python
# 100% line coverage, ZERO behavioral value — executes the function, asserts nothing.
def test_calculate():
    calculate(order)   # no assert! Coverage tools count this as "covered."
```

Professional stance:

- **Use coverage as a *floor and a discovery tool*, not a target.** A *drop* in coverage on a PR is worth a question; a high absolute number proves little.
- **Prefer branch coverage to line coverage** — it reveals untested decision paths.
- **Never reward coverage percentage directly.** It optimizes for the wrong behavior.
- **Audit suite quality with mutation testing** (next section), which measures whether tests *catch bugs*, not whether they *ran code*.

The defensible message to leadership: *"We don't target coverage; TDD makes coverage high naturally. What we target is fast feedback and a suite that actually catches regressions — which we verify with mutation testing, not a coverage gauge."*

---

## Mutation Testing

Mutation testing is the antidote to coverage theater and the real way to audit whether your TDD'd suite has teeth. A mutation tool (PIT for Java, `mutmut`/`cosmic-ray` for Python, `go-mutesting` for Go) makes tiny changes to production code — flips a `<` to `<=`, removes a `+`, negates a condition — and runs the tests. If a mutant survives (tests still pass), you have a behavior the suite doesn't actually verify.

```text
Original:   if balance < amount: raise InsufficientFunds
Mutant:     if balance <= amount: raise InsufficientFunds   # boundary changed
→ If no test fails, your suite never checked the exact-balance boundary.
```

| Metric | Measures | Gameable? |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Line coverage | Did the line *run*? | Trivially (call without asserting) |
| Branch coverage | Did each branch *run*? | Yes (run both, assert nothing) |
| **Mutation score** | Did the test *detect the change*? | Very hard — you must actually assert behavior |

Strict TDD tends to produce high mutation scores naturally, because every line was demanded by a failing assertion. Test-after suites often have high coverage but mediocre mutation scores. Run mutation testing on critical modules (billing, auth, pricing) — it's too slow for every CI run, but it's the truest measure of suite quality the laws are supposed to deliver.

## TDD on Legacy Code

The three laws assume you can write a test before the code. Legacy code is, by Michael Feathers's definition, **"code without tests"** — and it's usually *also* code without seams, so you can't easily write a unit test for it at all. The professional sequence:

1. **Characterization test first.** Before changing anything, write a test that *captures current behavior* (even if that behavior is "wrong"). This is test-*after*, not TDD — but it's the prerequisite to safe change.
2. **Find or create a seam.** A seam is a place to substitute behavior without editing in place — extract a method, introduce a parameter, wrap a static call. Feathers's *Working with Legacy Code* catalogs these.
3. **Get the unit under test.** Once there's a seam and a characterization test, you have a safety net.
4. **Now TDD the change.** With the net in place, write a failing test for the *new* behavior and proceed by the three laws.

```python
# Step 1: characterize (pin current behavior, even if ugly)
def test_legacy_price_current_behavior():
    assert legacy_price(qty=10, code="X") == 87.3   # whatever it does today

# Step 4: NOW you can TDD the fix, with the characterization test as a guard
def test_bulk_discount_applies_over_100():
    assert legacy_price(qty=150, code="X") == ...   # new behavior, red first
```

The key professional insight: **you cannot start with the three laws on legacy code.** You start with characterization (test-after) to build a net, refactor to introduce seams, and *then* the laws apply. Trying to "just TDD" untestable legacy is how teams conclude "TDD doesn't work here." See working with legacy code.

## Code Review Standards for TDD

A reviewer cannot see the loop the author followed — but they *can* enforce the artifacts the laws should have produced. Check, in order:

1. **Do the tests assert behavior, not nothing?** Reject tests with no meaningful assertion (the #1 coverage-theater tell).
2. **Do tests check behavior, not implementation?** A test that asserts on private methods or exact internal call sequences is brittle and law-compliant but harmful (mockist damage).
3. **Was the production change actually demanded by a test?** New production logic with no corresponding new/changed test is a Law-1 red flag.
4. **Are the tests fast and isolated?** A new "unit" test that hits the DB belongs in the integration tier.
5. **Is mocking limited to true boundaries?** Many mocks → flag for test-induced design damage.
6. **Are test names behavioral?** `test_rejects_overdraft` not `test_withdraw_2`.
7. **Did a bug fix come with a failing-first regression test?**

### Review comment templates

> "This test calls `process()` but has no assertion — it proves only that the code doesn't throw. What behavior should it verify?"

> "These mocks mirror the implementation's call sequence; a refactor would break them without a behavior change. Can we assert on the outcome instead (classicist/state-based)?"

> "This PR adds 40 lines of pricing logic but no test changed. Was this driven by a test? If not, what guards it?"

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Signal | Trap |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Unit-suite wall-clock time** | Is the nano-cycle still possible? | Ignoring slow creep until the loop dies |
| **Mutation score (critical modules)** | Does the suite actually catch bugs? | Too slow to run everywhere |
| **Escaped-defect rate / change-failure rate** | Are regressions reaching prod? | Lagging; noisy |
| **Flaky-test rate** | Is the suite trustworthy? | Tolerating "just rerun it" |
| **PR-to-merge feedback latency** | Is CI fast enough to keep the loop tight? | Optimizing the number, not the loop |
| Line/branch coverage | Floor + drop detector only | **Using it as a target** (Goodhart) |

The honest reporting principle (mirrors the coverage trap): **report the metric that tracks the value, not the one that's easy to dashboard.** "Mutation score on billing rose from 61% to 88%; change-failure rate on that module halved" is a real story. "Coverage hit 90%" may mean nothing.

## Rolling Out TDD to a Team

You almost never get to mandate TDD on a greenfield team that wants it. You're introducing it to people who are skeptical, under deadline, and own a codebase with few seams. The rollout that works is incremental and evidence-driven — the same shape as any successful quality initiative.

1. **Make the loop possible first.** If the unit suite is slow or flaky, *fix that before asking anyone to TDD.* You cannot follow the three laws with a 12-minute test run. This is the highest-leverage first step and the most-skipped.
2. **Start with bug fixes.** "Reproduce every bug with a failing test before fixing it" is the easiest TDD habit to sell — it's obviously valuable and low-controversy. It builds the muscle and the regression suite simultaneously.
3. **Pair and mob on katas.** Teach the *rhythm* on low-stakes exercises (FizzBuzz, Roman numerals, Bowling) via [pairing/mobbing](../05-pair-and-mob-programming/junior.md) before applying it to production work. See [Kata & Deliberate Practice](../07-kata-and-deliberate-practice/junior.md).
4. **Gate new code, grandfather old.** Configure CI to require tests on *changed* lines, not the whole legacy base. New code is test-first; legacy is characterized opportunistically.
5. **Avoid the coverage mandate.** Mandating a coverage number reliably produces assertion-free tests and discredits the whole effort. Sell trust and feedback speed, not percentages.

The failure mode to avoid: a top-down "all code must be TDD'd at 90% coverage from Monday" decree. It fails hundreds of files, blocks delivery, breeds coverage theater, and gets quality tooling disabled by an angry team within a quarter. The ratchet — make the loop fast, win on bug fixes, gate only new code — makes TDD the path of least resistance instead of a wall.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The slow suite that killed the loop

A team's unit suite crept from 20 seconds to 9 minutes as "unit" tests quietly acquired database dependencies. Developers stopped running tests locally; TDD's nano-cycle became impossible. Defects spiked. **Fix:** re-tier the DB-touching tests into an integration suite, mock the repositories in true unit tests, restore a sub-30-second unit run. **Lesson:** a slow unit suite doesn't just annoy — it *structurally prevents* the three laws.

### Incident 2: 92% coverage, critical bug shipped

A pricing module hit a mandated 92% line coverage, yet shipped a boundary bug (off-by-one on a tier threshold). The "covering" tests executed the code but asserted almost nothing. Mutation testing later showed a mutation score of 31%. **Fix:** dropped the coverage mandate, ran mutation testing on the module, rewrote tests to assert behavior. **Lesson:** coverage measures execution, not verification; only mutation testing (or honest TDD) measures whether tests catch bugs.

### Incident 3: Mockist tests blocked a safe refactor

A service had 300 mockist tests asserting exact collaborator call sequences. A behavior-preserving refactor (extracting a helper) turned 180 of them red despite zero behavior change. The team reverted the refactor rather than fix the tests — the suite had become an anchor against improvement. **Fix:** rewrote toward state-based (classicist) tests over time. **Lesson:** over-mocking produces a suite that resists the refactoring TDD is supposed to *enable*. (See [Senior](senior.md) on test-induced design damage.)

### Incident 4: The never-failed test

A test for a discount rule had silently stopped exercising the rule after a refactor moved the logic — it now asserted on a value computed elsewhere and *always passed*, even when the rule was deleted. Because it was written test-after, no one had ever seen it fail. **Fix:** a periodic "sabotage drill" — intentionally break production code and confirm the relevant test goes red. **Lesson:** the "see it fail first" law exists precisely to prevent this; test-after suites accumulate tests that can't fail.

---

## Team Conventions

Codify these so TDD is uniform across the team:

1. **Reproduce every bug with a failing test before fixing it** — non-negotiable, enforced in review.
2. **Unit tests run in seconds; anything touching DB/network/filesystem is integration-tier.**
3. **Default to state-based (classicist) tests; mock only true boundaries** (clock, RNG, network, repos).
4. **No assertion-free tests.** A test must verify behavior.
5. **Behavioral test names.** `test_<does_what>_<when>`.
6. **Coverage is a floor and a drop-detector, never a target.** Audit critical modules with mutation testing.
7. **Red `main` stops the line.** Flaky tests are quarantined and fixed, not rerun.
8. **New code is test-first; legacy is characterized then TDD'd** via seams.
