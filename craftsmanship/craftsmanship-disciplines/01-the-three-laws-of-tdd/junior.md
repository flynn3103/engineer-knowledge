## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** is the practice of writing a failing test *before* the code that makes it pass. **The Three Laws of TDD** are Robert C. Martin's (Uncle Bob's) distillation of that practice into three rules so strict they feel absurd the first time you read them. They are the *mechanics* — the gear ratio — that drives the larger discipline.

The three laws force you into a loop measured in **seconds**, not minutes: write a tiny bit of test, watch it fail, write a tiny bit of code, watch it pass. You never have more than a handful of lines of untested code in existence at any moment. Everything you build is, by construction, covered by a test that you saw fail and then saw pass.

### Why this matters

Here is how most people are first taught to program:

```python
# Write all the code...
def roman(n):
    result = ""
    for value, symbol in [(1000,"M"),(900,"CM"),(500,"D"),(400,"CD"),
                          (100,"C"),(90,"XC"),(50,"L"),(40,"XL"),
                          (10,"X"),(9,"IX"),(5,"V"),(4,"IV"),(1,"I")]:
        while n >= value:
            result += symbol
            n -= value
    return result

# ...then maybe test it (if there's time).
```

When this works, you don't know *which part* works. When it breaks, you don't know *where*. And the test — if it ever gets written — is shaped to confirm the code you already wrote, so it tests what the code *does*, not what it *should* do.

TDD inverts the order. The test comes first, fails first, and *pulls* the code into existence one small increment at a time. The three laws are the rules that keep those increments small.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write and run a unit test in at least one language (JUnit, `pytest`, `go test`, etc.).
- **Required:** `assert` and the basic structure of a test (arrange, act, assert).
- **Helpful:** A test runner you can invoke in **under a second** — a fast feedback loop is the whole point.
- **Helpful:** An editor with a "run tests" shortcut so red/green is one keystroke away.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **TDD** | Test-Driven Development — writing a failing test before the production code that satisfies it. |
| **The Three Laws** | Uncle Bob's three rules constraining *when* you may write test vs. production code. |
| **Red** | A failing test — the state you must reach before writing any production code. |
| **Green** | A passing test — reached by writing the minimum production code. |
| **Refactor** | Improving code structure without changing behavior, while all tests stay green. |
| **Nano-cycle** | One pass through red → green, often only seconds long. |
| **Production code** | The code that ships — the implementation, not the test. |
| **Failing for the right reason** | The test fails because the behavior is missing, not because of a typo or compile error you didn't intend. |
| **Fake it** | Returning a hard-coded value to pass the first test, before generalizing. |

---

## The Three Laws, Verbatim

Uncle Bob states them like this:

> 1. **You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.**
> 2. **You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail — and compilation failures are failures.**
> 3. **You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.**

Read them as a set of *locks*. Each law locks one of the two things you can do (write test, write code) until a precise condition is met:

- **Law 1** locks production code behind a *failing test*. No red, no code.
- **Law 2** locks you from over-writing the *test*. The moment the test fails — even if it just fails to compile — you stop writing test and switch to code.
- **Law 3** locks you from over-writing the *code*. The moment the test passes, you stop writing code and switch back to test (or refactor).

Together they form a cycle you cannot escape without breaking a law: test a little → fail → code a little → pass → repeat. The longest you can go without switching is **a few seconds**.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The test exists before the code it tests

This is the literal meaning of "test-driven." You do not write `add(a, b)` and then test it. You write `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, run it, watch it fail (the function doesn't exist yet), and *only then* write `add`.

### 2. You must see the test fail first

A test you've never seen fail is a test you don't trust. If you write the code first and the test passes immediately, you've proven nothing — the test might pass even when the code is broken. **Watching red turn to green is the proof that the test actually exercises the new behavior.**

### 3. Minimum code to pass — even if it's "wrong"

Law 3 is the one beginners resist hardest. If the test is `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, the minimum code that passes is:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return 5      # yes, really
```

This looks insane. It is also correct *for the current test*. You make it general only when a **second** test (`assert add(10, 1) == 11`) forces you to. This is called **"fake it till you make it,"** and it's a deliberate technique, not a joke — it proves your tests are strong enough to demand the real implementation.

### 4. Refactor only on green

You restructure code — rename, extract, deduplicate — **only when every test passes**. Green is your safety net: if a refactor breaks something, a test goes red and you know instantly. You never refactor on red, because then a failure could mean "my refactor broke it" *or* "the feature isn't done" — and you can't tell which.

### 5. The loop is tiny on purpose

The whole point is the **size of the increment**. Small increments mean: if something breaks, the cause is in the last 30 seconds of work, so debugging is trivial. The three laws exist to *force* the increments to stay small.

---

## The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

The three laws produce a three-beat rhythm:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R["RED<br/>write a small failing test"] --> G["GREEN<br/>write minimum code to pass"]
    G --> F["REFACTOR<br/>clean up, tests stay green"]
    F --> R
    style R fill:#e74c3c,color:#fff
    style G fill:#27ae60,color:#fff
    style F fill:#2980b9,color:#fff
```

| Phase | What you do | When you leave |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Red** | Write just enough test to fail (Law 2). Run it. Confirm it fails *for the right reason*. | The instant it fails. |
| **Green** | Write just enough production code to pass (Law 3). Run it. | The instant it passes. |
| **Refactor** | Improve names, remove duplication, simplify — without adding behavior. Run tests after each change. | When the code is clean and all tests are green. |

**Red and Green are governed by the three laws. Refactor is governed by [Refactoring as a Discipline](../03-refactoring-as-a-discipline/junior.md) and [Simple Design](../04-simple-design/junior.md).** The laws get you to working code; refactor makes it good.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **Write the test first** | A building inspector who writes the inspection checklist *before* the wall is built, so the wall is built to pass it — not the checklist bent to excuse the wall. |
| **See it fail first** | Testing a smoke alarm by pressing the test button. If it doesn't beep when you press it, the "it's fine, it never beeped" reasoning is worthless. |
| **Minimum code to pass** | Climbing a wall by reaching for the *next* hold, not the summit. You only ever solve the problem directly in front of you. |
| **Refactor on green** | Cleaning the kitchen *after* the meal is plated and safe, not mid-flip with a pan in the air. |
| **The tight loop** | A surgeon making one small, verified incision at a time, checking vitals after each — never one giant cut they hope works out. |

---

## Mental Models

**The intuition:** *"Never write a line of code that some test isn't already demanding."*

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
        │  Is there a failing test?         │
        └──────────────────────────────────┘
            │ NO                  │ YES
            ▼                     ▼
   write a tiny test       write the minimum
   that fails  ───────►    code to pass it
            ▲                     │
            │                     ▼
            └──────  refactor (still green) ◄──
```

You are always in exactly one of two modes: **"I need a failing test"** or **"I need to make the failing test pass."** The three laws decide which mode you're in, so you never have to wonder what to do next. That removal of decision fatigue is a real, underrated benefit.

Compare the two ways of working:

```
TEST-AFTER                      TEST-FIRST (TDD)
write 200 lines                 write 1 assertion → fail
hope it works                   write 1 line → pass
write tests to "cover" it       refactor
debug for an hour               repeat (each step verified)
```

## Pros & Cons

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Every line of production code is covered by a test you watched fail then pass | Feels slow at first; the rhythm has a learning curve |
| Defects are caught seconds after they're introduced | Hard to apply to code that isn't designed for testability (legacy, tight coupling) |
| The tests document exactly what the code is supposed to do | Easy to do *badly* — bad tests are worse than no tests |
| Code is testable *by construction* (you can't write untestable code first) | Some domains (UI pixels, exploratory spikes) fit awkwardly |
| You always have a working, green build a few minutes back | Requires a fast test runner; slow tests kill the loop |
| Refactoring is safe — the tests catch regressions instantly | Doesn't replace integration/acceptance testing (see [ATDD](../06-acceptance-test-driven-development/junior.md)) |

### When to use:
- Building logic with clear inputs and outputs (parsers, calculators, business rules, algorithms).
- Fixing a bug — write a failing test that reproduces it *first*, then fix.
- Anytime you'd otherwise be tempted to "just write it and test later."

### When NOT to use (yet):
- A throwaway exploratory **spike** where you don't yet know the design (spike, then delete, then TDD for real).
- Hard-to-test boundaries (raw UI rendering, third-party integrations) without first extracting the testable logic.

## A First Worked Example

Let's TDD a `add(a, b)` function from absolute zero, obeying every law. Watch how the laws constrain each keystroke.

### Step 1 — Law 1 says: no code yet. Law 2 says: write *just enough test to fail*.

```python
# test_calc.py
def test_adds_two_numbers():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

Run it. It fails — `NameError: name 'add' is not defined`. **That counts as a failure** (Law 2 explicitly includes "failure to compile / resolve"). We are now **RED**. Stop writing test.

### Step 2 — Law 3 says: write *just enough code to pass*.

```python
# calc.py
def add(a, b):
    return 5      # the literal minimum
```

Run it. **GREEN.** It passes. By Law 3, we stop — even though we "know" this is wrong. Resisting the urge to write `a + b` here is the discipline.

### Step 3 — Back to RED. A new test forces generalization.

```python
def test_adds_other_numbers():
    assert add(10, 1) == 11
```

Run it. `return 5` fails this. **RED.** Now Law 3 lets us write more code:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b     # now the general solution is the minimum that passes both
```

Run it. **GREEN**, both tests. The second test made `a + b` the *minimum*, so we wrote it honestly — driven by a test, not by guesswork.

### Step 4 — REFACTOR.

There's nothing to clean here, so we skip it. (On bigger problems this is where you'd rename, extract, dedupe — all on green.)

The point of the example isn't `add` — it's the **rhythm**: red → green → (refactor) → red → green. You never wrote a line that no test demanded.

## Code Examples

### Java (JUnit) — TDD a stack's `isEmpty`

```java
// RED — write the test first
@Test
void newStackIsEmpty() {
    assertThat(new Stack<Integer>().isEmpty()).isTrue();
}
```

Compile fails — no `Stack` class. That's a Law-2 failure; switch to code.

```java
// GREEN — minimum to pass
public class Stack<T> {
    public boolean isEmpty() { return true; }   // fake it
}
```

```java
// RED again — force generality
@Test
void stackWithOnePushIsNotEmpty() {
    Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<>();
    s.push(1);
    assertThat(s.isEmpty()).isFalse();
}
```

```java
// GREEN — now we need real state
public class Stack<T> {
    private int size = 0;
    public void push(T item) { size++; }
    public boolean isEmpty()  { return size == 0; }
}
```

Each test pulled exactly one capability into existence.

### Python (pytest) — TDD a `fizzbuzz`

```python
# RED
def test_returns_number_as_string():
    assert fizzbuzz(1) == "1"

# GREEN
def fizzbuzz(n):
    return "1"          # fake it

# RED
def test_two():
    assert fizzbuzz(2) == "2"

# GREEN — generalize
def fizzbuzz(n):
    return str(n)

# RED
def test_three_is_fizz():
    assert fizzbuzz(3) == "Fizz"

# GREEN
def fizzbuzz(n):
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return "Fizz"
    return str(n)
```

### Go — TDD a `Reverse`

> **Go note:** Go's `go test` runs in milliseconds and the toolchain is built into the language, which makes Go one of the most pleasant languages for living in the TDD loop. A compile error from a missing function *is* your red.

```go
// reverse_test.go — RED
func TestReverseEmpty(t *testing.T) {
    if got := Reverse(""); got != "" {
        t.Errorf("Reverse(\"\") = %q, want \"\"", got)
    }
}

// reverse.go — GREEN
func Reverse(s string) string {
    return ""        // fake it
}

// RED
func TestReverseSingle(t *testing.T) {
    if got := Reverse("a"); got != "a" {
        t.Errorf("got %q", got)
    }
}

// GREEN — generalize
func Reverse(s string) string {
    r := []rune(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(r)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        r[i], r[j] = r[j], r[i]
    }
    return string(r)
}
```

---

## Clean Code

### Name the test after the behavior, not the method

```python
# ❌ tells you nothing
def test_add(): ...

# ✅ tells you the expected behavior
def test_adding_two_positive_numbers_returns_their_sum(): ...
```

A failing test name should read like a one-line bug report.

### One assert-ed behavior per test (mostly)

A test should fail for **one reason**. If a test has five asserts checking five behaviors, a failure doesn't tell you which behavior broke. (Multiple asserts on the *same* behavior — e.g. checking several fields of one returned object — are fine.) See [Test Design & Fixtures](../02-test-design-and-fixtures/junior.md).

### Arrange–Act–Assert

```python
def test_withdraw_reduces_balance():
    account = Account(balance=100)   # Arrange
    account.withdraw(40)             # Act
    assert account.balance == 60     # Assert
```

Three visual blocks make every test scannable.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always see the test fail before making it pass.** A test you never saw red is a test you can't trust.
2. **Write the smallest test that can fail next.** Don't write the whole test suite up front.
3. **Write the smallest code that makes it pass** — even a hard-coded value (Law 3). Generalize only when a new test forces you.
4. **Refactor only on green.** Never restructure while a test is red.
5. **Keep the loop under a minute.** If a cycle takes ten minutes, your steps are too big.
6. **Confirm the test fails for the *right reason*** — the behavior is missing, not a typo in the test.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **The test that can't fail.** If you write code first and the test passes on the first run, you never saw red — the test might be asserting nothing real. Always reach red first.
- **A typo gives a false red.** The test fails, but because of a misspelled variable, not the missing behavior. Read the failure message; make sure it's the failure you expected.
- **Skipping the refactor step.** Green code that's never cleaned up accretes into a mess. The refactor beat is not optional.
- **Tests that depend on each other.** If test B only passes when test A ran first, your tests aren't isolated — see [Test Design & Fixtures](../02-test-design-and-fixtures/junior.md).

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Writing production code with no failing test** — the most fundamental Law-1 violation.
2. **Writing the whole implementation at once** to pass a single test (Law-3 violation) — you've left the loop.
3. **Writing five tests before any code** (Law-2 violation) — you can only have *one* failing test at a time.
4. **Never watching the test fail** — passing on first run proves nothing.
5. **Refactoring on red** — you can't tell a refactor bug from an unfinished feature.

---

## Tricky Points

- **"Compilation failure counts as failure" (Law 2)** means in compiled languages, a reference to a not-yet-written function *is* your red. You don't need a full assertion to be red — a missing symbol suffices, and you stop writing test the instant it won't compile.
- **"Fake it till you make it" is real, not a joke.** Returning a constant to pass the first test is a legitimate first step. It forces you to write a *second* test to drive out the generalization, which proves your tests are strong.
- **The three laws are the *mechanics*, not the *whole* of TDD.** TDD as a discipline also includes good test design, refactoring judgment, and knowing what to test. The laws just keep the loop tight. See [Senior](senior.md).

## Test Yourself

1. State the three laws of TDD.
2. Why must you watch a test fail *before* writing the code that passes it?
3. What is the minimum code to pass `assert add(2, 3) == 5`, and why is that defensible?
4. In which phase — red, green, or refactor — are you allowed to improve the code's structure?
5. Why does "compilation failure counts as a failure" matter for Law 2?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THE THREE LAWS
1. No production code unless to pass a failing test.
2. No more test than enough to fail (compile error = fail).
3. No more code than enough to pass the current failing test.

THE LOOP
  RED      → write a tiny failing test, SEE it fail
  GREEN    → write the minimum code to pass (fake it if needed)
  REFACTOR → clean up, tests stay green
  repeat (each loop = seconds to a minute)

RULES OF THUMB
  - one failing test at a time
  - see red before green
  - generalize only when a new test forces it
  - refactor only on green
```

---

## Summary

- **TDD** writes a failing test before the code; **the three laws** are the strict mechanics that keep the loop tight.
- **Law 1:** no production code without a failing test. **Law 2:** stop writing test the moment it fails (compile errors count). **Law 3:** stop writing code the moment the test passes.
- The laws produce the **red → green → refactor** cycle, with each loop lasting seconds to a minute.
- You must **see the test fail first**; you write the **minimum** code to pass (even a hard-coded value); you **refactor only on green**.
- The laws are the *mechanics* of TDD, not the whole discipline — good test design and refactoring judgment sit on top of them.
