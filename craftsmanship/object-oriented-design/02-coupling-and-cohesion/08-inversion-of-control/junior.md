## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** is one of the broadest ideas in software design, and it has one defining sentence:

> **Inversion of Control** is the principle where the *flow of control* is inverted: instead of *your* code calling into reusable code, the reusable code (a framework) calls into *yours*.

In ordinary, "normal" code you are in charge. Your `main()` runs top to bottom, and whenever it needs something done, it *calls* a function or a library: `sort(list)`, `json.parse(text)`, `db.query("...")`. You decide the order, you decide when each thing happens. The library is passive — it sits there until you call it.

Under IoC the relationship flips. You hand your code to a *framework* — a web framework, a test runner, a UI library, a game engine — and **the framework runs the main loop.** It decides when to call your code. You no longer write "first do A, then B, then C"; you write small pieces (a request handler, a button-click callback, a test method, an overridden hook) and the framework invokes them at the right moments. **Control has been inverted** — it now flows *from* the framework *into* you, not the other way around.

### Why this matters

This single shift is what separates a *library* from a *framework*, and it's the engine behind almost every framework you'll ever use: Spring, React, JUnit, Express, Django, Unity. Understanding "who calls whom" tells you how to use a tool, where your code plugs in, and — the reason this topic lives in **Coupling & Cohesion** — *why* IoC keeps your code loosely coupled: the framework owns the wiring and the timing, so your code only depends on the small, well-defined pieces it's handed.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write functions, classes, and a basic `main()` program; you understand what "calling a function" means.
- **Required:** You've used at least one library (something you `import` and call).
- **Helpful:** You've used at least one *framework* (a web framework, a test runner, a UI toolkit) — even if you didn't notice the inversion at the time.
- **Helpful:** A first feel for **[coupling](../01-minimise-coupling/junior.md)** — how a change in one place forces a change in another.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Flow of control** | The order in which statements and function calls actually execute at runtime — "what runs, and what calls what." |
| **Inversion of Control (IoC)** | The flow of control is inverted: the framework calls your code instead of your code calling the library. |
| **Library** | Reusable code **you call.** You stay in charge of the flow; you decide when to invoke it. |
| **Framework** | Reusable code that **calls you.** It owns the main loop and invokes your code at the right moments. |
| **Hollywood Principle** | "Don't call us, we'll call you" — the slogan for IoC: you register your code, the framework calls it back. |
| **Callback / hook** | A function (or method) you give to a framework so it can call you back when something happens. |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | One specific kind of IoC: an object's collaborators are *handed to it from outside* instead of being created inside it. |
| **Composition root** | The single place where the whole object graph is wired together (often near `main()` or a framework's startup). |

---

## The Core Idea: Who Is in Charge?

The entire topic collapses into one question: **who calls whom?**

```text
NORMAL control flow (you are in charge):
   your main()  ──calls──►  library
   your main()  ──calls──►  library
   (YOU decide the order and the timing)

INVERTED control flow (the framework is in charge):
   framework    ──calls──►  your code
   framework    ──calls──►  your code
   (the FRAMEWORK decides the order and the timing; you registered the pieces)
```

In the first picture the arrows point *out of* your code into reusable code. In the second they point *into* your code from the framework. That reversal of arrow direction **is** Inversion of Control. Everything else in this topic is detail about *how* that reversal is done and *why* it's useful.

A concrete pair to hold in your head:

- **You call a library:** `result = sorted(items, key=...)`. You wrote the `main`, you called `sorted`, you got the result back, you continued. Control never left your hands.
- **A framework calls you:** in a web app you write `def handle_get(request): ...` and *register* it for the URL `/users`. You never call `handle_get` yourself. The framework runs the server loop, waits for a request, and **calls your function for you** when one arrives. Control lives in the framework; your handler is summoned.

---

## Library vs. Framework

People use these two words loosely, but IoC gives a sharp, testable definition:

> A **library** is code you call. A **framework** is code that calls you. The dividing line is the **direction of control** — and that direction is exactly what IoC inverts.

| | **Library** | **Framework** |
|---|---|---|
| Who owns `main()` / the loop | **You** | **The framework** |
| Who calls whom | You → library | Framework → you |
| You provide | Calls at times you choose | Code to be called back later (handlers, hooks, components) |
| Mental model | A toolbox you reach into | A skeleton you fill in |
| Examples | `lodash`, `requests`, `math`, `jackson`, `numpy` | React, Spring, Django, JUnit, Express, Unity |
| Control is… | **Not** inverted | **Inverted** (this *is* IoC) |

> A simple test when you meet a new tool: *Do I call it, or does it call me?* If you call it, it's a library and you're in charge. If you register code and it calls you back, it's a framework and **control is inverted.**

Some tools are both: you call parts of them directly (library style) *and* register callbacks they invoke (framework style). Most large ecosystems blend the two. The useful skill is to notice, for any given line, *which way the call goes.*

---

## The Hollywood Principle

IoC has a famous nickname that captures it perfectly:

> **"Don't call us, we'll call you."** — the Hollywood Principle.

It comes from the (probably apocryphal) brush-off a casting agent gives an actor after an audition. You don't get to phone the studio every day asking if you've got the part; you leave your number, and *they* call *you* when they want you. That's exactly how framework code treats your code:

1. You **register** your code with the framework — a route handler, a button's `onClick`, a test method, an overridden lifecycle method.
2. You **give up** the right to call it yourself; you don't run the loop.
3. The framework **calls you back** at the right moment — when a request arrives, when the button is clicked, when the test runner reaches your method, when the component mounts.

The whole game of using a framework is: *figure out what to register, and what each callback should do, and then let go of control.* Beginners fight this — they look for "where do I call my handler?" The answer is: you don't. **The framework does. That's the point.**

---

## A Worked Example: Inverting a CLI Loop

The clearest way to *feel* IoC is to watch the same program written both ways. We'll build a tiny "command processor" that greets, adds numbers, and quits.

### Version A — You are in charge (library style, no inversion)

```python
# YOU own the loop. YOU call helpers. Control never leaves your code.
def greet(name):       return f"Hello, {name}!"
def add(a, b):         return a + b

def main():
    while True:
        line = input("> ")              # you call input
        parts = line.split()
        if parts[0] == "greet":
            print(greet(parts[1]))      # you call greet
        elif parts[0] == "add":
            print(add(int(parts[1]), int(parts[2])))  # you call add
        elif parts[0] == "quit":
            break

main()
```

Notice: **your** `main` runs the `while` loop, **your** code calls `greet` and `add`. `greet`/`add` are a tiny *library*. To add a new command you edit the `if/elif` ladder in the loop. You are fully in charge.

### Version B — A "framework" is in charge (control inverted)

Now imagine a tiny command-processor *framework* that owns the loop. You don't write the loop anymore; you **register handlers** and the framework calls them.

```python
# ---- the framework (someone else's code; you don't edit this) ----
class CommandApp:
    def __init__(self):
        self._handlers = {}                      # name -> your function

    def command(self, name):                     # registration decorator
        def register(fn):
            self._handlers[name] = fn
            return fn
        return register

    def run(self):                               # the framework owns the loop
        while True:
            parts = input("> ").split()
            handler = self._handlers.get(parts[0])
            if handler is None:
                print("unknown command"); continue
            if parts[0] == "quit":
                break
            print(handler(*parts[1:]))           # <<< the framework calls YOUR code

# ---- your code: you only register handlers; you never run the loop ----
app = CommandApp()

@app.command("greet")
def greet(name):          return f"Hello, {name}!"

@app.command("add")
def add(a, b):            return int(a) + int(b)

@app.command("quit")
def quit_():              return "bye"

app.run()                 # you hand control to the framework — and let go
```

What changed?

- In Version A, **your** code called `greet`. In Version B, **the framework's** `run` loop calls `greet` for you (`handler(*parts[1:])`). Control inverted.
- You no longer own the loop. You register pieces (`@app.command(...)`) and call `app.run()` *once*, handing control to the framework.
- Adding a command no longer means editing a central `if/elif` ladder — you just register a new handler. The framework already knows how to find and call it.

That last point is the payoff: **your handlers don't know about each other, and the loop doesn't know about your handlers** beyond the small `name -> function` contract. That decoupling is *why* this topic lives under Coupling & Cohesion.

> Every real framework you use — web, UI, test, game — is "Version B" at a much larger scale. Once you see the inversion here, you'll see it everywhere.

## The Forms of IoC

"IoC" is an umbrella. The *control* that gets inverted can be different things. Martin Fowler's point (in *bliki: InversionOfControl*) is that the useful question is always **"which control is inverted?"** Here are the common forms a junior will meet:

| Form of IoC | What gets inverted | Everyday example |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework lifecycle / template method** | The framework runs the algorithm and calls *your* steps | React calls your component's `render`; JUnit calls your `@Test` methods |
| **Event-driven / callbacks** | The event loop calls your handler when something happens | `button.onClick(handler)`; a UI event loop |
| **`main()` → framework** | The framework owns `main`/the run loop, not you | A web server runs the loop and dispatches requests to your handlers |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | The *construction* of your collaborators is done outside and handed in | A container creates your `OrderService` with its dependencies and gives it to you |
| **Service locator** | You ask a central registry for a dependency rather than constructing it | `Registry.get(Clock.class)` |

The first three invert **flow** (when your code runs). DI inverts **construction** (where your collaborators come from). They're all "inversion of control," which is exactly why the term is broad — and why seniors insist on naming *which* inversion they mean. (You'll see the airtight distinctions in [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md).)

---

## Code Examples

### Template Method — the framework runs the algorithm, calls your hook (Java)

The original meaning of "IoC" is the **Template Method** pattern: a base class (the framework) defines the skeleton of an algorithm and calls *your* overridden steps.

```java
// Framework code: owns the algorithm, calls YOUR hooks (the "primitive operations").
abstract class ReportGenerator {
    public final void generate() {     // the framework drives the steps
        var data = loadData();         // <-- calls your hook
        var body = formatBody(data);   // <-- calls your hook
        write("REPORT\n" + body);      // framework's own step
    }
    protected abstract List<Row> loadData();          // YOU implement
    protected abstract String formatBody(List<Row> d);// YOU implement
    private void write(String s) { System.out.println(s); }
}

// Your code: you fill in the holes; you NEVER call generate()'s steps yourself.
class SalesReport extends ReportGenerator {
    protected List<Row> loadData()           { return db.sales(); }
    protected String formatBody(List<Row> d) { return d.toString(); }
}

new SalesReport().generate();   // control flows framework -> your hooks
```

You don't call `loadData` or `formatBody` — `generate()` (the framework) does. That's IoC at its most classic: **"Don't call us (the steps), we'll call you."**

### Callback / event handler — the loop calls you back (TypeScript)

```typescript
// You register a callback; the event loop calls it back when the click happens.
button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("clicked!");        // the loop calls THIS, you never do
});

// Same shape with a higher-order function: YOU pass code to be called back.
[1, 2, 3].forEach((n) => console.log(n * 2));   // forEach calls your arrow fn
```

### A test runner calls your tests (Python, pytest)

```python
# You never call test_add(). The pytest framework discovers it and calls it.
def test_add():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2

# Run `pytest` and the FRAMEWORK finds every test_* function and invokes it.
# Control is inverted: you wrote the checks; the runner owns the loop.
```

Every one of these is the same move from different angles: **you supply code; something else calls it.**

## IoC vs DI vs DIP — First Contact

These three get mixed up constantly. Here's the junior-level summary; the airtight version is in [Senior](senior.md) and in the sibling [Dependency Inversion topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md).

| Term | One-line meaning | The "inversion" it names |
|---|---|---|
| **IoC** (broad) | The framework calls your code instead of you calling it | Direction of **control / flow** |
| **DI** | An object's collaborators are *handed in from outside*, not built inside | Control of **construction** (a *kind* of IoC) |
| **DIP** | A *design principle*: depend on abstractions, not concrete details | Direction of **source-code dependencies** (a different axis entirely) |

The relationships to memorize:

- **DI is *a kind of* IoC.** "Inverting *who constructs* my collaborators" is one specific control inversion. IoC is the whole umbrella; DI is one slice of it.
- **DIP is *not* IoC.** DIP is a *principle* about which way your dependencies point (toward abstractions). IoC is about who *drives execution*. They cooperate beautifully — DI is usually how you achieve DIP — but they are different ideas on different axes. Don't say "IoC" when you mean "DIP."

> Memorize the shape: **IoC ⊃ DI** (DI is one kind of IoC). **DIP** lives on a separate axis (dependency direction) and is achieved *via* DI. We don't re-derive DIP here — see the [Dependency Inversion topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/junior.md) for that.

```text
        ┌──────────────── IoC (control flow inverted) ────────────────┐
        │  template method · callbacks/events · main→framework         │
        │  ┌─────────────── Dependency Injection ───────────────┐      │
        │  │  collaborators supplied from outside (a kind of IoC)│      │
        │  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘      │
        └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   DIP  (separate axis): depend on abstractions, not details.
        Usually ACHIEVED using DI — but it is not the same thing.
```

## Why IoC Lowers Coupling

This topic is in **Coupling & Cohesion** for a concrete reason. IoC lowers coupling in two ways:

1. **The framework owns the wiring and the timing.** Your handler doesn't know how the request arrived, what ran before it, or what runs after. It depends only on the small contract it was handed (a `request` in, a `response` out). It does not depend on the loop, on other handlers, or on the framework's internals. *Fewer things to depend on → lower coupling.*

2. **Your high-level policy stays independent of low-level mechanism.** In Version B above, your `greet`/`add` logic doesn't depend on *how* input is read or *how* output is printed — the framework handles that. You could swap the loop (read from a file, a socket, a GUI) without touching your handlers. Policy and mechanism are decoupled.

A practical bonus: **testability.** Because your handler is just a function the framework happens to call, *you* can call it directly in a test — no framework, no loop, no server. Code that the framework calls is usually code you can call too, in isolation. (Deepened in [Middle](middle.md).)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Ask "who calls whom?" first.** For any tool, decide whether you call it (library) or it calls you (framework). That tells you where your code plugs in.
2. **When using a framework, let go of the loop.** Don't look for "where do I call my handler?" — you register it; the framework calls it. Embrace the inversion.
3. **Keep your callbacks/handlers small and focused.** A handler should do its one job; the framework handles the surrounding flow. Don't reach back into framework internals.
4. **Name *which* control is inverted** when you say "IoC" — flow (callbacks/template) or construction (DI). Vagueness here causes most of the confusion.
5. **Don't confuse IoC with DIP.** IoC = who drives execution. DIP = which way dependencies point. Use the right word.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **"IoC means dependency injection."** No — **DI is just one kind of IoC.** Template methods, callbacks, and event loops are IoC with no DI at all. (See [The Forms of IoC](#the-forms-of-ioc).)
2. **Trying to call your own handler.** Writing a route handler and then looking for the line that calls it. The framework calls it; you only register it.
3. **Calling "IoC" what is really "DIP."** IoC is about control direction; DIP is about dependency direction. Keep them apart.
4. **Treating "framework" and "library" as synonyms.** The whole distinction is *who is in charge of control.* It's not about size.
5. **Fighting the framework's flow.** Trying to seize back the main loop, run things in your own order, or bypass the lifecycle — usually a sign you're using the framework wrong.

---

## Tricky Points

- **The same `forEach` is IoC.** When you pass a function to `forEach`/`map`, *it* calls *your* function — control is (briefly) inverted. IoC isn't only about giant frameworks; it shows up any time you hand code to be called back.
- **A framework is "a library that calls you."** There's no hard size threshold. The defining property is the inverted control direction, not lines of code.
- **You still write the *what*, the framework owns the *when*.** IoC doesn't take your logic away — it takes the *scheduling* of your logic away. You define behavior; the framework decides timing.
- **`main()` may not be "yours" anymore.** Under many frameworks, the real entry point is the framework's; your code is summoned from inside it. "Where does execution actually start?" becomes a real question (explored at [Senior](senior.md)).

---

## Test Yourself

1. State Inversion of Control in one sentence.
2. What is the single defining difference between a *library* and a *framework*?
3. What is the Hollywood Principle, and what does it describe?
4. Is Dependency Injection the same as IoC? Explain the relationship.
5. Name three different *forms* of IoC.
6. Give one reason IoC lowers coupling.

## Cheat Sheet

```text
INVERSION OF CONTROL (IoC)
  Definition   the FLOW OF CONTROL is inverted:
               framework calls YOUR code, instead of you calling a library.
  Slogan       "Don't call us, we'll call you" (the Hollywood Principle).

LIBRARY vs FRAMEWORK
  library      code YOU call      → you own the loop      (control NOT inverted)
  framework    code that CALLS you → it owns the loop      (control INVERTED = IoC)
  test:        "do I call it, or does it call me?"

FORMS OF IoC (which control is inverted?)
  template method  framework runs the algorithm, calls your hooks
  callbacks/events the loop calls your handler when something happens
  main→framework   the framework owns main()/the run loop
  DI               your collaborators are supplied from OUTSIDE (a KIND of IoC)
  service locator  you ask a registry for a dependency

DON'T CONFUSE
  IoC ⊃ DI         DI is ONE kind of IoC (inverts construction)
  IoC ≠ DIP        DIP = which way DEPENDENCIES point (a separate axis)

WHY IT HELPS COUPLING
  framework owns wiring/timing → your code depends on a tiny contract only
  policy stays independent of mechanism; handlers are directly testable
```

## Summary

- **Inversion of Control** is the broad principle where the *flow of control* is inverted: a **framework calls your code** instead of your code calling a library. Its slogan is the **Hollywood Principle** — *"Don't call us, we'll call you."*
- The line between a **library** (you call it) and a **framework** (it calls you) *is* the direction of control — exactly what IoC inverts.
- IoC is an **umbrella**: the inverted control can be the framework **lifecycle/template method**, **callbacks/events**, the **main loop**, **dependency injection**, or a **service locator**. Always ask *which* control is inverted.
- **DI is one kind of IoC** (IoC ⊃ DI). **DIP is a different axis** (dependency direction), achieved *via* DI — not the same as IoC.
- IoC **lowers coupling**: the framework owns wiring and timing, your code depends only on the small contract it's handed, policy stays independent of mechanism, and handlers become directly testable.
