## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** and **When**

At the junior level IoC was a slogan — *"don't call us, we'll call you"* — and a way to tell a library from a framework. At the middle level it becomes a **design tool you reach for deliberately**: you *invert control on purpose* to decouple a stable, high-level policy from the low-level mechanisms it would otherwise be glued to.

The recurring middle-level skills are three:

1. **Naming the inversion precisely.** "IoC" is too broad to be useful on its own; you must say *which* control is inverted (flow vs. construction) or you'll talk past your teammates — and conflate IoC, DI, and DIP.
2. **Choosing the right IoC mechanism** for the job: a template method, a strategy you inject, a callback, or full framework dispatch — each inverts a different thing at a different cost.
3. **Knowing when the inversion is *worth it*.** IoC trades explicit, easy-to-follow control flow for decoupling and pluggability. That trade pays off at real seams and *over*-pays everywhere else.

## Which Control Is Inverted? (Fowler's Question)

Martin Fowler's most useful contribution to this topic (in *bliki: InversionOfControl*) is a question, not a definition:

> Whenever someone says "this uses Inversion of Control," ask: **"Which control is being inverted?"**

The phrase is so broad it's almost meaningless without that answer. Here are the inversions you'll actually name as a mid-level engineer:

| The control being inverted | Before (you in charge) | After (inverted) | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flow of an algorithm's steps** | Your code runs each step | A skeleton runs the algorithm, calls *your* steps | **Template Method** |
| **Which behavior a step uses** | The class hard-codes the behavior | The behavior is handed in and called | **Strategy + injection** |
| **When code runs (events)** | You poll / call in order | The loop calls your handler on an event | **Callbacks / Observer / event loop** |
| **The program's main loop** | Your `main()` drives | The framework's loop drives; it calls your handlers | **`main()` → framework** |
| **Where collaborators come from** | The object `new`s its own deps | An outside agent builds and supplies them | **Dependency Injection** |

The first four invert **flow** (*when/whether your code runs*). The last inverts **construction** (*where your collaborators come from*). Both are honestly "inversion of control" — which is exactly why the unqualified term causes so much confusion, and why a precise engineer always says *which*.

---

## Template Method: The Original IoC

When the term "Inversion of Control" was coined (for object-oriented frameworks in the late '80s), it meant precisely this: a **base class owns the algorithm and calls your overridden steps.** This is the Template Method pattern, and it's the purest illustration of the inversion.

```python
# FRAMEWORK side: owns the algorithm skeleton; calls YOUR hooks.
class HttpServer:
    def handle_request(self, raw):          # the framework drives every request
        req = self.parse(raw)               # framework step
        if not self.authorize(req):         # <-- YOUR hook
            return self.reject()            # framework step
        result = self.process(req)          # <-- YOUR hook (the real work)
        return self.render(result)          # <-- YOUR hook

    def parse(self, raw):  ...              # framework provides
    def reject(self):      ...              # framework provides
    # hooks you override:
    def authorize(self, req): return True   # default; override to change policy
    def process(self, req):   raise NotImplementedError
    def render(self, result): return str(result)

# YOUR side: fill in the holes. You never call handle_request's steps yourself.
class UserApi(HttpServer):
    def authorize(self, req): return req.token == "secret"
    def process(self, req):   return {"user": req.path.split("/")[-1]}
```

The control inversion is exact: **you do not call `authorize`, `process`, or `render` — `handle_request` does.** You supply *what* each step means; the framework supplies *when* it runs and *in what order*. The high-level algorithm (parse → authorize → process → render) lives once, in the framework, and is immune to your variations; your variations plug into named holes without knowing the surrounding flow.

> Template Method is the **inheritance-based** form of IoC. Its sibling, **Strategy + injection** (next), achieves the same inversion with **composition** — which is usually preferable. See [Composition Over Inheritance](../05-composition-over-inheritance/junior.md).

---

## Strategy + Injection: Inverting a Pluggable Step

Template Method inverts a step via *overriding a subclass method*. The composition-based alternative inverts the *same* step by **handing in an object** that does it — the Strategy pattern, supplied by **dependency injection**.

```typescript
// The pluggable step is an interface (a "port" the policy owns).
interface PricingStrategy { price(base: number): number; }

// High-level policy: it CALLS the strategy, but does NOT decide which one.
class Checkout {
  constructor(private pricing: PricingStrategy) {}   // injected from outside
  total(base: number): number {
    return this.pricing.price(base);                 // calls whatever was handed in
  }
}

// Interchangeable behaviors (the framework/composition root picks one):
class Standard implements PricingStrategy { price(b: number) { return b; } }
class BlackFriday implements PricingStrategy { price(b: number) { return b * 0.7; } }

// Composition root decides the wiring; Checkout never knows which it got.
const checkout = new Checkout(new BlackFriday());
```

Two inversions are stacked here:

- **Flow inversion (Strategy):** `Checkout` *calls* `pricing.price(...)` without knowing the concrete behavior — control over *which* pricing runs has been handed out.
- **Construction inversion (DI):** `Checkout` does not `new` its `PricingStrategy`; it's **handed in** from outside. That's the dependency-injection slice of IoC.

The result: `Checkout` (policy) is fully decoupled from any concrete pricing rule (mechanism). Add a `Clearance` strategy and `Checkout` doesn't change at all — that's [Open/Closed](../../04-solid/02-ocp-open-closed/junior.md) made real, and IoC is the lever. (The dependency-direction story — depending on the `PricingStrategy` *abstraction* rather than a concrete class — is **DIP**, covered in the [Dependency Inversion topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/junior.md).)

---

## Inverting a Whole Program: main → Framework

The biggest inversion is at the top: **who owns `main()` / the run loop.** Watch a procedural program become a framework-driven one.

### Procedural — your `main()` is in charge

```python
def main():
    server = socket.create_server(("", 8080))
    while True:                          # YOU own the loop
        conn, _ = server.accept()
        raw = conn.recv(65536)
        path = parse_path(raw)
        if path == "/users":             # YOU dispatch
            conn.send(users_response())
        elif path == "/orders":
            conn.send(orders_response())
        conn.close()
```

You own the accept loop, the parsing, and the dispatch `if/elif`. Every new route edits the central loop. The web *mechanism* (sockets, parsing, dispatch) is braided into your *policy* (what `/users` returns).

### Inverted — the framework owns the loop, calls your handlers

```python
app = Flask(__name__)               # the framework

@app.route("/users")                # you REGISTER a handler
def users():   return users_response()

@app.route("/orders")
def orders():  return orders_response()

app.run(port=8080)                  # hand control to the framework — and let go
```

The framework now owns the accept loop, parsing, and dispatch. You contribute only **handlers** and **route registrations**. Control is inverted: you never call `users()`; the framework calls it when a matching request arrives. Your policy (*what `/users` returns*) is completely separated from the mechanism (*sockets, parsing, dispatch*), which now lives in reusable framework code.

The same pattern recurs across every framework:

| Framework | Who owns the loop | What you register / override (it calls you) |
|---|---|---|
| **Flask / Express / Spring MVC** | request-dispatch loop | route handlers / controllers |
| **JUnit / pytest** | test runner | `@Test` methods / `test_*` functions |
| **React** | render/reconciliation loop | components, `useEffect`, event handlers |
| **Unity / a game engine** | game loop | `Update()`, `OnCollision()` |
| **GUI toolkits (Qt, Android)** | event loop | `onClick`, `onCreate`, lifecycle callbacks |

> React is a clean mental model: you never call `render` or `useEffect`. You *declare* a component, and React's reconciler decides when to call it, when effects run, when to re-render. The component lifecycle **is** IoC — control over *when your code runs* belongs to React.

---

## The Composition Root

Once construction is inverted (DI), a new question appears: **if objects don't build their own dependencies, who does — and where?** The answer is the **composition root**.

> The **composition root** is the single place, as close to the program's entry point as possible, where the entire object graph is wired together — concrete implementations are chosen and injected.

```python
# composition root: the ONE place that knows concrete types and wires them.
def build_app():
    clock      = SystemClock()
    repo       = PostgresOrderRepo(db_pool())     # concrete chosen HERE
    gateway    = StripeGateway(api_key=ENV_KEY)   # concrete chosen HERE
    place_order = PlaceOrder(repo, gateway, clock) # everything injected
    return CommandApp(place_order)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_app().run()        # after this point, nothing calls `new`/concrete ctors
```

Why concentrate wiring in one place?

- **Every other module stays free of concrete dependencies.** `PlaceOrder` knows only the *abstractions* it was handed; only the composition root knows that "the repo is Postgres" and "the gateway is Stripe."
- **Swapping an implementation is a one-line change** at the root (e.g., `InMemoryOrderRepo` for tests, `FakeGateway` for a demo). The policy code never changes.
- **The dependency graph is visible in one file** instead of scattered across a hundred `new` calls. You can read the whole system's wiring at a glance.

A **DI container** (next levels) is just an automated composition root: instead of writing the `new` calls by hand, you register types and let the container build the graph. Whether hand-wired or container-driven, the *principle* is the same — construction is inverted out of the objects and into one root.

---

## IoC vs DI vs DIP — The Working Distinction

This is the distinction that trips up most mid-level engineers in design discussions and interviews. Keep these on **three separate axes** — and keep it consistent with the [Dependency Inversion topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md), which owns the deep version.

| | **IoC** | **DI** | **DIP** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Architectural *principle/pattern* | Construction *technique* | Design *principle* |
| **Inverts** | Flow of **control** (who calls whom) | **Construction** (who builds your deps) | Direction of **source dependencies** |
| **Answers** | Does the framework call me, or I call it? | Are my collaborators built inside, or handed in? | Do I depend on abstractions or details? |
| **Scope** | Whole program / a step's timing | One object's collaborators | The compile-time dependency graph |
| **Example** | A web framework calls your handler | `new Service(repo)` — `repo` passed in | `Service` depends on `Repo` *interface*, not `PostgresRepo` |

The three relationships you must be able to state without hesitating:

1. **DI is a *kind of* IoC** (IoC ⊃ DI). DI inverts *construction*; IoC also covers inverting *flow* (template methods, callbacks, the main loop), which is not DI. Fowler even renamed the construction-sense of "IoC" to **"Dependency Injection"** *precisely because* IoC was too broad to specifically mean DI.

2. **DIP is *not* IoC — different axis.** DIP is about **which way dependencies point** (toward abstractions). IoC is about **who drives execution**. You can have IoC with no DIP (a template-method framework with no abstractions) and DIP with no framework IoC (a plain function taking an interface parameter). They *cooperate* — DI is usually how you achieve DIP — but they're distinct.

3. **DI is the usual bridge between them.** DI is a *kind of IoC* (it inverts construction) *and* the usual *means to DIP* (it supplies the abstraction). That dual role is why the three are so easy to fuse — and why naming them precisely is a senior signal.

> One sentence to memorize: **IoC = who controls *flow*; DI = who controls *construction* (a kind of IoC); DIP = which way *dependencies* point (a separate axis, usually reached via DI).** The deep version is in the [DIP topic — Senior](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md); we don't re-derive it here.

---

## Why IoC Lowers Coupling (Mechanically)

The Junior level said IoC lowers coupling; here's the mechanism, in coupling terms.

- **Policy depends on a small contract, not on the mechanism.** In the inverted web app, your handler depends on `(request) -> response`. It does **not** depend on the accept loop, the parser, the dispatcher, or sibling handlers. The number of things it's coupled to drops to one tiny interface — the lowest-coupling shape there is.
- **The mechanism's source dependency points *into* the policy, not out.** Under Template Method/Strategy, the framework calls *your* code; your code doesn't import the framework's loop. Combined with DIP (depending on an owned abstraction), the source dependency at the seam inverts — exactly the move that makes layered/hexagonal architectures possible. (Full treatment in the [DIP topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md).)
- **Pluggability falls out for free.** Because the framework calls *interchangeable* pieces (handlers, strategies, components), you add behavior by adding a piece — not by editing the loop. That's [Open/Closed](../../04-solid/02-ocp-open-closed/junior.md): the policy is closed against the change; the change is a new plug-in.
- **Testability falls out for free.** Code the framework calls is code *you* can call. A handler is a function — call it directly in a unit test with no server. A strategy is an object — pass a fake in. The inverted construction (DI) means you can substitute test doubles at the seam without touching production wiring.

The connascence view (see [Connascence](../03-connascence/junior.md)): IoC and DI replace strong, hidden couplings — a class *constructing* its own concrete collaborator (connascence of name/type on a concrete) and a hard-coded call ladder — with a weak, explicit one: connascence on a small interface, made visible at the composition root.

## When to Reach for IoC — and When Not To

IoC is a *tool with a cost*, not a default to apply everywhere. Reach for it deliberately.

**Reach for IoC when:**

- There's a **real seam with two or more sides** — a step that genuinely varies (pricing strategies, payment gateways, storage backends), or a boundary you want to fake in tests.
- You're **building on a framework** — then the inversion isn't a choice; you adopt the framework's lifecycle and register your code into it.
- A **stable high-level policy** must stay independent of a **volatile low-level mechanism** (the database, a third-party SDK, the UI toolkit).

**Stay direct (no inversion) when:**

- A dependency is **stable and singular** — there's one implementation, no boundary, no test seam. Injecting it or wrapping it in a strategy adds indirection that buys nothing. (Mirrors the "don't wrap every class in an interface" point in the [DIP topic — Senior](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md).)
- The program is **small and you own the whole flow** — a script's explicit `main()` is *clearer* than a framework's hidden loop. IoC's readability cost isn't worth paying.
- The collaborator is a **pure value or utility** — `new Money(...)`, a stateless helper. "New is not always glue"; plain construction of stable, harmless objects is fine and clearer.

> The guiding heuristic, identical to the rest of the curriculum: **invert at real seams; stay concrete in the middle.** IoC's decoupling is a real benefit at a boundary and a pure cost in the interior.

---

## Trade-offs

| Dimension | Direct control (you call it) | Inverted control (IoC) |
|---|---|---|
| Readability of flow | High — read top to bottom | Lower — flow is in the framework, not your file |
| "Where does execution start?" | Obvious (`main`) | Hidden in the framework's loop |
| Coupling | Higher — policy braided with mechanism | Lower — policy depends on a small contract |
| Pluggability / extension | Edit the central loop | Add a handler/strategy (Open/Closed) |
| Testability | Often needs the whole program | High — call handlers / inject fakes directly |
| Debuggability | Step through your own calls | Step *through framework magic* (harder) |
| Best when | Small program, stable single deps, you own the flow | Real seams, framework-based, policy vs. volatile mechanism |

The core asymmetry: IoC **buys** decoupling, pluggability, and testability; it **costs** explicit, easy-to-follow control flow. At a real seam the purchase is worth it; in straight-line interior logic you're paying for decoupling you don't need and losing readability you do.

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. The framework owns the loop but you need to do something *before* it starts

Most frameworks give you lifecycle hooks (`@PostConstruct`, `app.on_startup`, a constructor, `beforeAll`) precisely because you've handed away the main loop. Use the hook the framework provides; don't try to wedge code in *around* `app.run()`.

### 2. IoC without any DI

A pure template-method framework (or a plain `forEach`) inverts *flow* with **no dependency injection at all**. Don't assume "IoC" implies a container. Many of the cleanest inversions are just an overridden hook or a passed-in callback.

### 3. DI without DIP

`new Service(new PostgresClient())` injects a **concretion**. The *technique* is DI; the *principle* DIP is violated (you depended on a detail). Injection alone doesn't decouple you from a concrete type — you must inject an **abstraction**. (See the [DIP topic](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/junior.md).)

### 4. Callbacks that leak control timing

A callback hands control timing to the framework — including *error* timing and *threading*. A handler that assumes it runs on the main thread, or in a particular order relative to other callbacks, is coupling to undocumented framework behavior. Treat "when and on what thread will I be called?" as part of the contract.

---

## Tricky Points

- **"IoC" alone is too vague to design with.** Always say *which* control is inverted — flow (template/callback/loop) or construction (DI). Teams that skip this conflate IoC, DI, and DIP and argue past each other.
- **Inversion moves the *timing*, not the *logic*.** Your behavior is still yours; IoC takes away *when it runs*, not *what it does*. The cost is that "when" is now somebody else's code.
- **A container is not required for IoC, or even for DI.** Hand-wiring in a composition root is DI. Containers automate the wiring; they don't define the principle.
- **More inversion is not better.** Each inversion you add hides more flow. Inverting interior logic that has no seam buys nothing and costs readability — the same over-application warned about for DIP.
- **"New is glue" — but not always.** Constructing a *volatile* collaborator inside a class glues you to it (bad). Constructing a *stable value* (`new Money(5)`) glues you to nothing that matters (fine). The smell is `new`-ing things that should be swappable, not all `new`.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always name the inversion.** Say "template-method IoC" or "DI" — never bare "IoC" — so flow vs. construction is unambiguous, and so you don't blur into DIP.
2. **Prefer composition (Strategy + injection) over inheritance (Template Method)** for pluggable steps — it's more flexible and avoids fragile base classes. (See [Composition Over Inheritance](../05-composition-over-inheritance/junior.md).)
3. **Inject *abstractions*, not concretions** — otherwise you have DI without DIP and remain coupled to a detail.
4. **Concentrate wiring in a composition root** near the entry point; keep every other module free of concrete-construction knowledge.
5. **Invert at real seams only.** Apply the volatility/seam test: boundary or second implementation → invert; stable, singular interior dependency → stay direct.
6. **Respect the framework's lifecycle** instead of fighting for the main loop; use the hooks it gives you.

---

## Test Yourself

1. What is Fowler's key question about any claim of "Inversion of Control," and why does it matter?
2. How do Template Method and Strategy+injection invert the *same* control differently?
3. What is a composition root, and what problem does it solve?
4. State the IoC / DI / DIP distinction in one sentence each.
5. Give two concrete reasons IoC lowers coupling.
6. When should you *not* invert control?

---

## Summary

- IoC is a **deliberate decoupling tool**: invert control to keep a stable, high-level **policy** independent of the low-level **mechanism** it would otherwise be glued to.
- Always answer Fowler's question — **"which control is inverted?"** The forms: **Template Method** (steps), **Strategy + injection** (which behavior), **callbacks/events** (when), **main → framework** (the loop), **DI** (construction).
- The **composition root** is the one place where the object graph is wired; it keeps all other modules free of concrete-construction knowledge. A **DI container** automates it.
- **IoC ⊃ DI** (DI inverts construction); **DIP is a separate axis** (dependency direction), usually reached *via* DI. Name them precisely.
- IoC lowers coupling mechanically: policy depends on a tiny contract, the source dependency inverts at the seam, and pluggability + testability fall out. **Invert at real seams; stay concrete in the middle.**
