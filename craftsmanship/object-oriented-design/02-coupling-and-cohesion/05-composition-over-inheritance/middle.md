## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** and **When**

At the junior level you learned the rule and the is-a/has-a test. At the middle level the question becomes a judgement you make on real code: *this looks like an is-a — is it actually safe to inherit, or is it implementation reuse wearing an is-a costume?* The two failure modes are symmetric:

- **Over-inheriting** — using `extends` for code reuse, building deep hierarchies, putting methods on base classes that not all subclasses can honor. Produces fragile, rigid code.
- **Over-composing** — reflexively shattering a genuine, clean is-a into hand-wired parts and forwarding methods, adding indirection and boilerplate for no flexibility gain.

The skill is calibration, and it rests on one precise idea: **inheritance is only safe when the subclass is genuinely substitutable for the superclass** (the [Liskov Substitution Principle](../../04-solid/03-lsp-liskov-substitution/junior.md)) — and even then, *implementation* inheritance carries a tax that composition often avoids. This file makes "why composition" concrete with the fragile-base-class mechanism and Bloch's famous broken-subclass bug, then works the canonical refactor.

## The Fragile Base Class Problem, In Depth

"Inheritance is the strongest coupling" is abstract until you see *how* a subclass reaches into its parent. The problem: **a subclass depends not just on what the superclass does, but on how it does it** — specifically, on which of its own methods the superclass calls internally (its "self-calls").

```java
// A base class whose two methods happen to share an implementation detail:
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;
    public void increment()      { count++; }
    public void incrementBy(int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) increment();   // ← internally calls increment()
    }
    public int get() { return count; }
}

// A subclass overrides increment() to log — reasonable, right?
class LoggingCounter extends Counter {
    @Override public void increment() {
        System.out.println("inc");
        super.increment();
    }
}
```

Call `loggingCounter.incrementBy(3)` and you get **three** "inc" log lines — because `incrementBy` internally calls `increment()`, and the override intercepts each one. The subclass author never asked for that; it's a consequence of `Counter`'s *internal* decision to implement `incrementBy` in terms of `increment`.

Now the base class author "optimizes":

```java
public void incrementBy(int n) { count += n; }   // no longer calls increment()
```

A behavior-preserving change to `Counter` — *the public API is identical* — and `LoggingCounter` silently stops logging bulk increments. **Nothing in either class's signature changed. Tests on `Counter` pass. The subclass broke anyway.**

> This is the **fragile base class problem**: because the subclass depends on the superclass's *self-call structure* — an implementation detail — the superclass cannot safely change that detail. Inheritance turns private implementation choices into a contract the parent didn't know it was promising.

The root cause: inheritance is **white-box reuse**. The subclass can see, and accidentally depend on, the parent's internals. Composition is **black-box** — the wrapper only ever calls the wrapped object's *public* methods, so the wrapped object is free to change how it implements them.

---

## Bloch's Broken Subclass: the HashSet Counting Bug

Joshua Bloch's *Effective Java*, Item 18 ("Favor composition over inheritance"), gives the canonical worked example. The goal is innocent: a `Set` that counts how many elements you've *attempted* to add over its lifetime.

### The broken inheritance version

```java
// ❌ BROKEN: extends HashSet to count insertion attempts
public class InstrumentedHashSet<E> extends HashSet<E> {
    private int addCount = 0;

    @Override public boolean add(E e) {
        addCount++;
        return super.add(e);
    }
    @Override public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c) {
        addCount += c.size();           // looks right…
        return super.addAll(c);
    }
    public int getAddCount() { return addCount; }
}
```

Now run it:

```java
InstrumentedHashSet<String> s = new InstrumentedHashSet<>();
s.addAll(List.of("a", "b", "c"));
System.out.println(s.getAddCount());   // prints 6, NOT 3
```

**Why 6?** Because `HashSet.addAll` is *internally implemented by calling `add` once per element* — an undocumented self-call. So our `addAll` adds 3 (the `c.size()`), then `super.addAll` runs and calls our overridden `add` three more times (+3). The count is double.

The subclass broke because it depended on a fact `HashSet` never promised: *that `addAll` does not call `add`*. There is no good fix inside the inheritance model:

- Remove the `addCount += c.size()` from `addAll`? Works **today**, but only because of the current internal self-call — a future JDK could re-implement `addAll` without calling `add`, and the count silently goes wrong again. You'd be depending on an implementation detail across releases.
- Re-implement `addAll` yourself? Fragile, duplicative, and you're now reverse-engineering `HashSet`'s internals.

### The composition fix

Don't *extend* `HashSet` — *wrap* one. Hold a `Set` and forward to it (Bloch calls the forwarding class a **wrapper**, and this is the Decorator pattern):

```java
// ✅ FIXED: compose a Set; forward to it; you control every call
public class InstrumentedSet<E> implements Set<E> {
    private final Set<E> s;             // HAS-A (any Set, not just HashSet)
    private int addCount = 0;
    public InstrumentedSet(Set<E> s) { this.s = s; }

    @Override public boolean add(E e)  { addCount++; return s.add(e); }
    @Override public boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c) {
        addCount += c.size();
        return s.addAll(c);             // s.addAll is a BLACK BOX — we don't
    }                                   //   see or care if it calls add internally
    public int getAddCount() { return addCount; }

    // ... forward the rest of Set's methods to s (size, contains, iterator, ...)
}
```

Now `new InstrumentedSet<>(new HashSet<>()).addAll(of("a","b","c"))` reports **3**. Why? Because `s.addAll` is a black box — *whatever* it does internally, it never re-enters *our* `add`. We only count at our own boundary. The self-call trap is gone.

And as a bonus, this composed version is *more* flexible than the inheriting one: it wraps **any** `Set` (a `TreeSet`, a `LinkedHashSet`, even another wrapper), because it depends on the `Set` *interface*, not the `HashSet` *class*. The broken version could only ever instrument a `HashSet`.

> **Bloch's conclusion, verbatim in spirit:** inheritance is appropriate only when the subclass really is a subtype of the superclass (a true is-a) *and* the superclass was designed and documented for extension. Otherwise, inheritance breaks encapsulation — and you should compose.

---

## Substitutability Is the Real is-a Test

"It sounds like is-a" is not enough. The rigorous test is the [Liskov Substitution Principle](../../04-solid/03-lsp-liskov-substitution/junior.md):

> **A subtype is a valid is-a only if an instance of it can replace an instance of the supertype *everywhere*, with no caller able to tell the difference (no broken behavior, no thrown surprises, no tightened preconditions).**

This is where the famous "obvious" is-a relationships fall apart:

- **`Penguin` is a `Bird`** — sounds fine, until `Bird` has `fly()`. A caller iterating birds and calling `fly()` crashes on the penguin. Penguin is *not* substitutable for a flying `Bird`. The fix is composition: a `Bird` *has a* `Movement` strategy; penguins get `Walk`, sparrows get `Fly`.
- **`Square` is a `Rectangle`** — sounds airtight (a square *is* a special rectangle), but inheriting from `Rectangle` with independent `setWidth`/`setHeight` breaks: code that sets width and height separately, expecting them independent, gets surprised when a `Square` forces them equal. Not substitutable.

```
Sounds like is-a   →   inheritance candidate
        │
        ▼
Substitutable? (LSP) ── no ──▶  it was reuse-in-disguise → COMPOSE
        │
       yes
        │
        ▼
Designed/documented for extension, shallow, stable?  ── no ──▶ COMPOSE
        │
       yes
        ▼
      INHERIT
```

The lesson: the english sentence "A is a B" is a *hint*, not a verdict. The verdict is substitutability. When substitutability fails, you were really reaching for *reuse*, and reuse is a has-a — so compose.

## The Mechanisms of Composition

"Compose instead" is not one technique but a family. Knowing them lets you pick the right shape:

| Mechanism | What it is | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Plain delegation** | Hold an object; forward calls to it | The default — reuse one collaborator's behavior |
| **Strategy** | Hold a *swappable* behavior object behind an interface | One axis of behavior varies (sort order, attack, pricing) |
| **Decorator** | Wrap an object in another implementing the *same* interface, adding behavior | Stack optional features (logging, compression, the `Set` counter) |
| **Dependency injection** | Receive your composed parts via the constructor instead of `new`-ing them | You want the parts swappable/testable from outside |
| **Mixins / traits** | Language feature that mixes method *implementations* into a class without a base-class | Cross-cutting reusable behavior; languages that support it (Scala, Rust, Ruby, Python) |

The first four are pure "objects holding objects." **Mixins/traits** are a middle ground worth flagging now: they give you *implementation reuse* (like inheritance) but without forcing a single base-class hierarchy — you can mix in several. Scala `trait`, Rust `trait` (with default methods), Ruby `module`/`include`, and Python multiple inheritance / `abc` mixins all occupy this space. They shift the calculus (covered at [Senior](senior.md)), but the core preference — assemble behavior, don't entangle it in a hierarchy — is the same.

## The Canonical Refactor: a Logger Hierarchy Collapsed

A second class-explosion case, this time around a `Logger`/output-stream design — the kind you actually meet in real codebases.

### The exploding hierarchy

You want logging that can go to the **console**, a **file**, or the **network**, and can optionally be **timestamped**, **encrypted**, and **compressed**. As inheritance:

```
Logger
 ├ ConsoleLogger
 │   ├ TimestampedConsoleLogger
 │   ├ EncryptedConsoleLogger
 │   └ TimestampedEncryptedConsoleLogger ...
 ├ FileLogger
 │   ├ TimestampedFileLogger
 │   ├ CompressedFileLogger
 │   └ TimestampedCompressedFileLogger ...
 └ NetworkLogger
     └ ... every combination again ...
```

3 destinations × (2³ feature combinations) = **24 classes**, with massive duplication (the timestamp logic is copy-pasted across every `Timestamped*`). Add "rate-limited" and you double it.

### The composed redesign (Decorator + Strategy)

Separate **where it goes** (a destination — Strategy) from **what's done to the message** (features — Decorators that wrap a logger and add one behavior):

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Logger(ABC):                       # the common interface
    @abstractmethod
    def log(self, msg: str) -> None: ...

# --- Destinations (one class each) ---
class ConsoleLogger(Logger):
    def log(self, msg): print(msg)
class FileLogger(Logger):
    def __init__(self, path): self.path = path
    def log(self, msg): open(self.path, "a").write(msg + "\n")
class NetworkLogger(Logger):
    def __init__(self, sock): self.sock = sock
    def log(self, msg): self.sock.send(msg.encode())

# --- Feature decorators: each WRAPS a Logger and adds ONE behavior ---
class TimestampDecorator(Logger):
    def __init__(self, inner: Logger): self.inner = inner   # HAS-A Logger
    def log(self, msg): self.inner.log(f"[{now()}] {msg}")  # delegate + augment
class EncryptDecorator(Logger):
    def __init__(self, inner: Logger): self.inner = inner
    def log(self, msg): self.inner.log(encrypt(msg))
class CompressDecorator(Logger):
    def __init__(self, inner: Logger): self.inner = inner
    def log(self, msg): self.inner.log(compress(msg))
```

Now *any* combination is assembled at runtime by nesting, with **no new class**:

```python
# timestamped, encrypted file logging — composed, not subclassed:
logger = TimestampDecorator(EncryptDecorator(FileLogger("/var/log/app.log")))
logger.log("payment received")

# plain console:           ConsoleLogger()
# compressed network:      CompressDecorator(NetworkLogger(sock))
```

**6 small classes** (3 destinations + 3 features) cover all 24 combinations *and every future one*. The timestamp logic lives in exactly one place. Adding "rate-limited" is **one** new decorator, and it instantly combines with everything. This is the class-explosion cure made concrete: the count went from 3 × 2³ (multiply) to 3 + 3 (add).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "composed at runtime"
        T[TimestampDecorator] --> E[EncryptDecorator] --> F[FileLogger]
    end
    note["each wraps the next via has-a; all share the Logger interface"]
```

## Strategy and Decorator Are This Principle

The two refactors above are not coincidence — they're the two textbook patterns that *are* "composition over inheritance," and recognizing them is the middle-level payoff:

- **Strategy** — "I have *one* behavior that varies." Hold a swappable strategy object behind an interface; delegate to it. (The game character's `weapon`; the logger's *destination*.) Strategy replaces *"a subclass per variant of one behavior."*
- **Decorator** — "I have *optional, stackable* features." Wrap an object in another with the *same* interface, each adding one behavior; nest them. (The `InstrumentedSet`; the logger's timestamp/encrypt/compress.) Decorator replaces *"a subclass per combination of features."*

> Whenever you catch yourself about to write a subclass *per variant* of a behavior, you want **Strategy**. Whenever you're about to write a subclass *per combination* of optional features, you want **Decorator**. Both are the same move: pull the variation out of the type hierarchy and into a held object.

This is also the link to the [Open/Closed Principle](../../04-solid/02-ocp-open-closed/junior.md): with Strategy/Decorator you extend behavior by *adding a new component*, never by editing existing classes — open for extension, closed for modification, achieved through composition rather than a sprawling hierarchy.

---

## When Inheritance Earns Its Place

To avoid strawmanning: inheritance is genuinely the better tool in these cases.

1. **Template Method / framework hooks.** A base class defines the *skeleton* of an algorithm and calls overridable hook methods at fixed points — `extends Activity` (Android), `extends Thread`, `extends TestCase`, an abstract `HttpServlet` with `doGet`/`doPost`. The base class was **designed and documented for extension**, which is exactly Bloch's precondition. Here the self-call structure isn't an accident — it *is* the published contract.
2. **A genuine, substitutable, stable is-a.** `class PermanentEmployee extends Employee`, `class Circle implements Shape` extended by nothing problematic. If the subtype passes LSP and the hierarchy is shallow and won't sprout axes, inheritance is clean and *less* code than forwarding.
3. **Sharing a stable interface + invariant across a closed set of types.** Sealed/closed hierarchies (Kotlin `sealed`, Rust `enum`, Scala `sealed trait`) where the set of subtypes is fixed and known — algebraic-data-type-style modeling. This is inheritance used for *typing*, not open-ended reuse.

The common thread: inheritance is right when the relationship is about **being a substitutable type**, the hierarchy is **shallow and stable**, and (for implementation inheritance) the base was **built for it**. It's wrong when it's reuse-in-disguise, deep, or spanning multiple independent axes.

---

## Trade-offs

| Concern | Inheritance | Composition |
|---|---|---|
| Coupling | Strong (white-box: parent internals) | Weak (black-box: component's public interface) |
| Binding time | Static (compile time) | Dynamic (runtime, swappable) |
| Boilerplate | Low — methods inherited for free | **Higher** — forwarding methods to expose the component |
| Encapsulation | Broken (fragile base class) | Preserved |
| Flexibility under change | Low — re-shaping a hierarchy is invasive | High — swap a part |
| Multiple axes of variation | Explodes (product) | Scales (sum) |
| Indirection / call depth | Shallow | Deeper (delegate chains; the "self problem" — below) |
| Best for | Substitutable, shallow, stable is-a; framework hooks | Reuse, varying behavior, optional features, testability |

The honest cost of composition: **forwarding boilerplate** and an extra layer of **indirection**. To make a wrapper expose the wrapped object's interface, you may hand-write dozens of one-line forwarding methods (`public int size() { return s.size(); }`). Inheritance gives you those for free. This is a real ergonomics tax — and it's exactly why languages added features (Kotlin `by` delegation, Lombok `@Delegate`, Go embedding) to *generate* the forwarding, getting composition's safety without the typing. (Detailed at [Senior](senior.md).)

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. The genuinely deep, genuinely substitutable hierarchy

Some domains *are* taxonomies (geometric shapes, AST node types, UI widgets in a framework). A shallow, LSP-clean hierarchy there is fine — don't shatter it into composition out of dogma. The principle is "favor," and a clean is-a is a legitimate use.

### 2. Inheriting an interface, then composing the implementation

A very common and *correct* combination: `implements Set` (interface inheritance — you are a `Set`, substitutable) while *holding* a `Set` and forwarding to it (composition for the implementation). That's exactly `InstrumentedSet` above. Interface inheritance + composition is often the best of both: substitutable type, black-box reuse.

### 3. Diamond / multiple-axis reuse without traits

In a single-inheritance language with no traits (older Java, C#), you simply *can't* inherit two implementations. Composition isn't just preferable there — it's the only option for combining two behaviors. Languages with traits/mixins (Scala, Rust, Ruby) relax this (see [Senior](senior.md)).

---

## Tricky Points

- **The fragile base class breaks with *no signature change*.** That's what makes it insidious — the parent's public API is identical, tests pass, yet subclasses break, because the dependency was on *internal self-calls*. This is the deep reason inheritance "breaks encapsulation."
- **`addCount += c.size()` then `super.addAll` double-counts** specifically because `HashSet.addAll` self-calls `add`. Memorize this; it's the most-asked composition interview example.
- **"Substitutable" is stricter than the english sentence.** `Penguin`/`Bird` and `Square`/`Rectangle` both *sound* like is-a and both fail LSP. Always run the substitutability test, not the grammar test.
- **Composition can over-indirect.** A chain of ten decorators or a delegate that delegates to a delegate can be harder to follow than one clear method. Composition is the default, not a mandate to fragment everything — clarity still wins.
- **Mixins/traits are a third option**, not "inheritance" or "composition." They give implementation reuse without a single base hierarchy, shifting the trade-off in languages that have them.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Run the substitutability (LSP) test, not the grammar test.** "Sounds like is-a" isn't enough; "can replace the parent everywhere" is.
2. **For one varying behavior, reach for Strategy; for stacked optional features, reach for Decorator.** Recognize the pattern and you've recognized the refactor.
3. **Wrap, don't extend, third-party classes** you don't control (you can't see or trust their self-call structure) — the `InstrumentedSet` lesson.
4. **Compose against interfaces.** Hold the abstraction (`Set`, `Logger`, `AttackBehavior`), not the concrete class — that's where the flexibility lives.
5. **Inherit only when the base was *designed for extension*** (framework hook / documented Template Method) **or** the is-a is shallow, stable, and substitutable.
6. **Combine interface inheritance with composition** when you need to *be* a type but want black-box reuse of its implementation.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Walk through *why* `LoggingCounter.incrementBy(3)` logs three times, and why a "behavior-preserving" change to `Counter` breaks it. What's this called?
2. In Bloch's `InstrumentedHashSet`, why does `addAll` of three elements report a count of 6? How does composition fix it?
3. Why is the composed `InstrumentedSet` *more* flexible than the inheriting version, beyond just fixing the bug?
4. Give the substitutability test for is-a, and apply it to `Penguin`/`Bird`.
5. Map: "one behavior varies" and "stackable optional features" each to the pattern that solves it by composition.
6. State composition's two main costs and one language feature that mitigates them.

---

## Summary

- Inheritance is the **strongest coupling** because it's **white-box**: a subclass depends on the superclass's *internal self-call structure*, so a behavior-preserving parent change can silently break it — the **fragile base class problem**.
- **Bloch's `InstrumentedHashSet`** (count = 6, not 3) is the canonical proof: `HashSet.addAll` self-calls `add`, double-counting. The fix is **composition** — wrap a `Set` and forward; the wrapped object is a black box, so the trap disappears, *and* the wrapper now works with any `Set`.
- The real is-a test is **substitutability (LSP)**, not grammar — `Penguin`/`Bird` and `Square`/`Rectangle` sound like is-a but fail it.
- Composition has mechanisms: **delegation, Strategy, Decorator, dependency injection, mixins/traits.** **Strategy** replaces "a subclass per variant of one behavior"; **Decorator** replaces "a subclass per combination of optional features."
- **Inheritance still earns its place** for framework Template-Method hooks (base designed for extension), shallow/stable substitutable is-a relationships, and closed typed hierarchies.
- Composition's cost is **forwarding boilerplate and indirection**; language features (Kotlin `by`, Go embedding, `@Delegate`) reduce it.
