# Orthogonality — Junior

> **Category:** [Coupling & Cohesion](../../README.md) — designing a system so that unrelated parts stay unrelated: a change in one place has no effect on the others.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Orthogonality** is the property of a system in which **unrelated things stay unrelated** — you can change one part without disturbing the others. The term was popularized for software by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas in *The Pragmatic Programmer*, who summed it up in five words:

> **"Eliminate effects between unrelated things."**
> — Hunt & Thomas, *The Pragmatic Programmer*

That's the whole idea. If your logging code and your business rules are orthogonal, you can rewrite the logger without touching a single business rule, and rewrite a business rule without touching the logger. If the database layer and the screen layout are orthogonal, swapping the database doesn't ripple into the UI. The opposite — a system where touching *anything* risks breaking *something else* — is **non-orthogonal**, and it's the source of an enormous amount of fear, bugs, and slow change.

### Why this matters

Most of the pain in maintaining software comes from **unexpected effects**: you fix a bug in the payment code and somehow the email receipts break; you change a date format in one report and three unrelated screens start showing wrong totals. Those surprises happen because parts that *should* have been independent were secretly wired together. Orthogonality is the discipline of keeping them apart on purpose, so a change's blast radius is small and predictable.

The payoff is concrete and immediate: **localized change** (you edit one place), **less risk** (a fault is contained), **easier testing** (you can test a part in isolation), and **parallel work** (two people change two orthogonal modules without colliding).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write functions and group code into modules/classes.
- **Required:** A basic sense of **dependencies** — when code A "uses" code B.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to **[Minimise Coupling](../01-minimise-coupling/junior.md)** and **[Maximise Cohesion](../02-maximise-cohesion/junior.md)**, because orthogonality is those two ideas viewed as a single property of the whole system.
- **Helpful:** A feel for **[Separation of Concerns](../../01-generic/03-separation-of-concerns/junior.md)** — keeping different kinds of work in different places.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Orthogonal** | Two things are orthogonal if a change in one has **no effect** on the other. Borrowed from geometry: perpendicular (independent) axes. |
| **Non-orthogonal** | The opposite — changing one thing forces changes in, or breaks, others. |
| **Effect** | An observable consequence: a broken test, a changed output, a required edit elsewhere. |
| **Independence** | The ability to vary one thing while everything else stays fixed. |
| **Cross-cutting concern** | A concern (logging, security, persistence) that, if not isolated, spreads across many unrelated modules and destroys orthogonality. |
| **Global state** | Data reachable and mutable from anywhere; the most common cause of hidden, non-orthogonal effects. |
| **Blast radius** | How many other parts a single change can affect. Orthogonality shrinks it. |

---

## Where the Word Comes From

"Orthogonal" is borrowed from **geometry and linear algebra**, where two vectors are orthogonal if they meet at a right angle — they are **independent axes**. Moving along the x-axis changes your horizontal position and *nothing* about your vertical position; the y-axis is unaffected. The axes don't interfere.

```
        y
        ▲
        │
        │        moving along x changes ONLY x.
        │        moving along y changes ONLY y.
        └─────────▶ x        the axes are INDEPENDENT.
```

Software borrows the metaphor directly. Each independent "axis" is a separate concern or feature — the database, the UI, the logging, a pricing rule. In an orthogonal system you can slide along one axis (change the database) without sliding along any other (the UI stays put). In a non-orthogonal system the axes are tilted into each other: pushing one drags the others along.

> Orthogonality is **independence made into a design goal**: arrange the system so its concerns sit on separate axes.

---

## The Definition

> **Two or more things are orthogonal if changes in one have no effect on the others.**

Spelled out for software:

- **Unrelated features should be independent.** A change to feature A should not require, or accidentally cause, a change to unrelated feature B.
- **Unrelated modules should be decoupled.** Touching module A shouldn't ripple into module B unless B genuinely depends on A's behavior.
- **The system has separate "control axes."** Each concern can be adjusted on its own dial.

Notice the word **unrelated**. Orthogonality is *not* the claim that nothing in the system depends on anything — that's impossible and undesirable. It's the claim that things which are **conceptually unrelated** are also **technically independent**. The shipping calculator and the login page are unrelated concepts; in a good design they're also unrelated in code.

---

## The Two Analogies From the Book

*The Pragmatic Programmer* gives two analogies that nail the idea. Memorize both — they appear in interviews and they're genuinely the clearest way to explain orthogonality.

### Non-orthogonal: helicopter controls

A helicopter has four primary controls: the **cyclic** (tilt), the **collective** (lift), the **throttle** (engine power), and the **anti-torque pedals** (yaw). The brutal fact is that **every input affects every axis.** Pull up on the collective to climb, and the aircraft tries to yaw and the engine bogs down, so you must simultaneously adjust the pedals and the throttle — which in turn change the lift again. Nothing can be adjusted in isolation; every control is coupled to every other.

> "When you pull up on the collective... you simultaneously roll, yaw, pitch, and adjust the throttle." Helicopters are famously hard to fly *because* their controls are **non-orthogonal**.

A non-orthogonal codebase flies like that helicopter: you can't touch one knob without fighting the other three.

### Orthogonal: a stereo system

Now picture a home stereo. The **volume** knob changes loudness and nothing else. The **balance** slides sound left/right and nothing else. The **tone** controls treble/bass and nothing else. You can set each one independently; turning up the bass never changes the volume. The controls are **orthogonal** — and as a result the system is effortless to operate, easy to reason about, and you can swap the speakers without re-tuning the amplifier.

```
NON-ORTHOGONAL (helicopter)        ORTHOGONAL (stereo)
  input ──┬──▶ pitch                 volume ─▶ loudness
          ├──▶ roll                   balance ─▶ left/right
          ├──▶ yaw                    tone    ─▶ treble/bass
          └──▶ lift                   (each input → one effect)
 (every input → every axis)
```

**Goal:** build systems whose controls behave like the stereo, not the helicopter.

## Why Orthogonality Matters

The benefits are practical and they compound:

| Benefit | Why orthogonality gives it to you |
|---|---|
| **Localized change** | A change to one concern lives in one place; you don't chase ripples across the codebase. |
| **Promotes reuse** | An independent component (with no hidden ties) can be lifted out and reused elsewhere. A component tangled with global state can't. |
| **Reduces risk** | A fault is **isolated** to its module instead of cascading. One broken part doesn't take the system down. |
| **Shrinks the test surface** | You can test one component alone, with a small, focused test, instead of standing up the whole world. |
| **Enables parallel work** | Two engineers edit two orthogonal modules at the same time without merge conflicts or stepping on each other. |
| **Easier to estimate** | When a change's blast radius is small and predictable, you can actually predict how long it takes. |

The single sentence to remember: **orthogonality turns "change the system" into "change one part of the system."** That difference — between editing one box and editing a tangle — is most of what makes a codebase pleasant or miserable to work in.

## A Worked Example: A Non-Orthogonal Design and Its Fix

Let's see a small change ripple across modules in a non-orthogonal design, then fix it.

### The requirement

We compute an order total, log it, and store it. Three concerns: **pricing** (business logic), **logging**, and **persistence**.

### Non-orthogonal version (TypeScript)

```typescript
// Everything is braided together in one function.
function processOrder(order: Order, db: Database, logFile: string): number {
  let total = 0;
  for (const item of order.items) {
    total += item.price * item.qty;
  }
  // logging is hard-wired into the pricing logic:
  appendFileSync(logFile, `Order ${order.id}: $${total}\n`);
  // persistence is hard-wired in too, with a literal SQL string:
  db.execute(`INSERT INTO orders VALUES (${order.id}, ${total})`);
  return total;
}
```

Now watch a change ripple. Product asks: **"Log as JSON instead of plain text, and write it to a logging service, not a file."** That's a *logging* change — it has nothing to do with pricing or persistence. But because everything is braided together:

- You must edit `processOrder` — the **pricing** function — to change logging.
- The function signature `logFile: string` is now wrong; **every caller** of `processOrder` must change.
- The pricing tests now break, because they were calling a function that touches the filesystem.
- You can't test pricing without a real (or faked) log file and database.

One unrelated change forced edits to pricing, callers, and tests. That's the helicopter.

```
   "Change the log format"  ──┬──▶  edit pricing function
                              ├──▶  change every caller's signature
                              ├──▶  break pricing tests
                              └──▶  touch persistence-adjacent code
        (one input → every axis = NON-ORTHOGONAL)
```

### Orthogonal redesign (TypeScript)

Put each concern on its own axis. Pricing computes; it does **not** log or store. Logging and persistence are passed in as collaborators the caller composes.

```typescript
// AXIS 1 — pricing: pure, knows nothing about logging or storage.
function orderTotal(order: Order): number {
  return order.items.reduce((sum, i) => sum + i.price * i.qty, 0);
}

// AXIS 2 — logging: an interface; the implementation is independent.
interface Logger {
  record(event: string, data: object): void;
}

// AXIS 3 — persistence: an interface; swap the DB without touching pricing.
interface OrderStore {
  save(orderId: string, total: number): void;
}

// Composition root wires the axes together — the ONLY place they meet.
function processOrder(order: Order, log: Logger, store: OrderStore): number {
  const total = orderTotal(order);
  log.record("order_priced", { id: order.id, total });
  store.save(order.id, total);
  return total;
}
```

Now re-do the same change — **"log as JSON to a service":**

```typescript
// New logger implementation. Nothing else in the system changes.
class JsonServiceLogger implements Logger {
  record(event: string, data: object): void {
    fetch("https://logs.internal/ingest", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ event, ...data }),
    });
  }
}
```

The pricing function `orderTotal` is **untouched**. Its tests still pass. Every caller is untouched. We swapped one logger for another — exactly like turning the stereo's tone knob without changing the volume. **The change stayed on its own axis.**

| | Non-orthogonal | Orthogonal |
|---|---|---|
| Files touched to change logging | Pricing + all callers + tests | One new `Logger` class |
| Pricing testable in isolation? | No (needs file + DB) | Yes (pure function) |
| Swap the database? | Rewrite `processOrder` | New `OrderStore` impl |
| Two devs changing log + price at once? | Conflict | Independent |

## Global State: The Orthogonality Killer

The fastest way to destroy orthogonality is **global mutable state** — data that any code can read and write from anywhere. It creates *invisible* connections between modules that look completely unrelated.

```python
# A global "config" mutated from anywhere.
CONFIG = {"currency": "USD", "tax_rate": 0.0}

def checkout(cart):
    CONFIG["tax_rate"] = 0.20          # module A quietly mutates the global
    return total(cart) * (1 + CONFIG["tax_rate"])

def generate_report(orders):
    # module B reads the SAME global — and is silently affected by checkout()!
    return sum(o.amount * CONFIG["tax_rate"] for o in orders)
```

`checkout` and `generate_report` look unrelated. They live in different files; one is a sales flow, one is reporting. But they share `CONFIG["tax_rate"]`, so **running checkout changes what the report computes.** If a report is generated before any checkout, `tax_rate` is `0.0`; after a checkout it's `0.20`. The output depends on *invisible execution order*. That's the helicopter again — pulling the checkout knob moves the report axis.

The orthogonal fix: **pass what you need; don't reach into a global.**

```python
def checkout(cart, tax_rate):              # tax rate is an explicit input
    return total(cart) * (1 + tax_rate)

def generate_report(orders, tax_rate):     # its own explicit input
    return sum(o.amount * tax_rate for o in orders)
```

Now the two functions share nothing mutable. Calling one cannot affect the other. Each is independently testable (just pass a rate), independently reusable, and independently changeable. **Eliminating shared global state is the single highest-leverage move toward orthogonality.**

## How Orthogonality Relates to Coupling and Cohesion

Orthogonality isn't a *new* idea so much as **coupling and cohesion seen from one level up.** It's the system-wide property you get when coupling is low and cohesion is high:

- **[Low coupling](../01-minimise-coupling/junior.md)** means modules don't depend on each other's internals — so a change in one doesn't force a change in another. That's exactly "no effect between things."
- **[High cohesion](../02-maximise-cohesion/junior.md)** means each module groups things that belong together — so a single concern lives on a single axis instead of being smeared across many.

Put them together and you get orthogonality:

> **Orthogonality = system-level decoupling along feature axes.** It's coupling and cohesion viewed as *independent dimensions* of the whole system.

```
   Low coupling  ──┐
                   ├──▶  ORTHOGONALITY
   High cohesion ──┘     (unrelated things vary independently)
```

You don't need to re-learn coupling and cohesion here — see those topics for the mechanics. Orthogonality is the goal those two principles serve when you zoom out to the level of features and concerns.

---

## How to Achieve It

Concrete techniques, each of which keeps a concern on its own axis:

1. **Layering.** Put UI, business logic, and persistence in separate layers, each depending only downward. A UI change can't reach into persistence.
2. **Modular design.** Group each concern into a module with a narrow interface; let modules talk only through those interfaces, not by reaching into each other.
3. **Avoid global state.** Pass dependencies in (parameters, injection) instead of reaching into globals/singletons. (See the example above.)
4. **Keep cross-cutting concerns separate.** Logging, persistence, security, and business logic are different axes — don't braid them. (This is **[Separation of Concerns](../../01-generic/03-separation-of-concerns/junior.md)**; the techniques for isolating cross-cutting ones are explored at higher levels.)
5. **Decouple your toolkits and libraries.** Don't let a third-party library's types leak through your whole codebase. Wrap it so swapping it stays local.
6. **Don't rely on properties you can't control.** If your code depends on the exact internal field of someone else's object, you're coupled to a thing that can change without warning. Depend on stable, published interfaces.

## Mental Models

**The intuition:** *"I should be able to turn one knob without any other knob moving."*

```
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  ORTHOGONAL                  NON-ORTHOGONAL    │
   │                                                │
   │  ●──▶ pricing                ●─┐               │
   │  ●──▶ logging                  ├─▶ everything  │
   │  ●──▶ storage                ●─┘   tangled     │
   │  ●──▶ UI                                       │
   │  (each dial → one effect)   (any dial → chaos) │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

A second model: think of orthogonality as **keeping the wiring diagram readable.** In an orthogonal system the diagram is a few boxes with a few clearly labeled wires between them. In a non-orthogonal one it's a hairball — every box wired to every other — and no human can predict what a change will do.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Ask "what else will this change affect?"** before you make a change. In an orthogonal design the honest answer is "nothing else." If it's "lots of things," your design is tilted.
2. **Keep concerns on separate axes:** business logic separate from logging, persistence, and UI.
3. **Pass dependencies in; don't reach out to globals.** Explicit inputs keep modules independent.
4. **Hide libraries behind your own thin interface** so swapping them stays a local change.
5. **Give each module a narrow, intentional interface** and talk to it only through that.
6. **Test components in isolation.** If a component can *only* be tested with the whole system running, it isn't orthogonal yet — that's a design signal.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Braiding cross-cutting concerns into business logic** — `print`/log/SQL calls sprinkled through pricing code. Every such call ties two axes together.
2. **Global mutable state** — the silent killer; modules become coupled through shared data with no visible wire.
3. **Leaking a library's types everywhere** — now the whole codebase depends on that library; you can't change it without a system-wide edit.
4. **Reaching into another module's internals** — depending on a field or behavior you can't control couples you to its accidents.
5. **Confusing orthogonality with "no dependencies at all."** Some structure is shared on purpose; orthogonality is about keeping *unrelated* things independent, not banning all dependencies.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Orthogonality is about *unrelated* things.** Related things *should* depend on each other. The skill is telling related from unrelated — see [Middle](middle.md) for the contractor/team test that makes this concrete.
- **Perfect orthogonality is impossible.** Every system shares *some* infrastructure (a database, a config, a framework). The goal is to maximize independence where it matters, not to chase a 100% that doesn't exist. (Trade-offs at [Senior](senior.md).)
- **Orthogonality can tension with DRY.** Sometimes keeping two things independent is worth a little duplication, because merging them would couple things that should vary separately. The two principles pull against each other; knowing when to favor each is a senior skill — see [DRY](../../01-generic/07-dry/junior.md) and [Senior](senior.md).
- **A "small" change with a big blast radius is a *measurement* of non-orthogonality.** If a one-line logging tweak touches twenty files, the design — not the change — is the problem.

## Summary

- **Orthogonality** = unrelated things stay unrelated: a change in one has **no effect** on the others ("eliminate effects between unrelated things," Hunt & Thomas).
- The word is borrowed from **geometry** — independent, perpendicular axes. The **stereo** (each knob → one effect) is orthogonal; the **helicopter** (every input → every axis) is not.
- Benefits: **localized change, reuse, isolated faults, a smaller test surface, parallel work.**
- **Global mutable state** is the classic killer — it wires unrelated modules together invisibly. Pass dependencies in instead.
- Orthogonality is **coupling and cohesion at the system level**: low coupling + high cohesion = independence along feature axes.
