# Minimise Coupling — Professional

## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — keeping coupling appropriate across a large, multi-contributor codebase over years.

Coupling is the property that decides whether a codebase stays *changeable*. It is also the property that degrades *silently*: no single PR introduces "too much coupling," yet every reasonable-looking change — a direct call here, a shared global there, an entity passed where a field would do — ratchets it upward. A year later, a one-line feature requires touching nine files and nobody can deploy anything alone.

At the professional level the question is operational: **how do you keep coupling appropriate when hundreds of changes land per week from dozens of people?** And — the half most teams miss — how do you stop the over-correction, where "decouple everything" produces an interface-per-class, event-spaghetti system that's *also* unmaintainable? The answer is a system: review standards that name both failures, metrics that track coupling *and direction*, conventions that make the right level of coupling the default, and a disciplined way to decouple legacy code without breaking it.

## Enforcing Low Coupling in Code Review

Most coupling enters one PR at a time, in forms that look locally harmless. A reviewer's job is to name the coupling *kind* and ask whether it can be pushed lower — without demanding speculative indirection.

### The high-value review questions

> **"What does this module need to *know* about that one — and can it know less?"**
> **"If we changed [the database / the SDK / this entity's shape], how many files would this PR force us to touch later?"**

### Coupling smells to flag

| Smell in the diff | Coupling kind | Review ask |
|---|---|---|
| New `import` of a concrete infra class into domain code | Wrong-direction / Zone of Pain | "Depend on a domain port; let infra implement it." |
| A new global / singleton / `static` mutable | Common coupling | "Pass it in. What happens when two callers mutate this?" |
| A new `boolean`/enum flag that switches behaviour inside | Control coupling | "Split into two methods, or inject the behaviour." |
| A whole entity passed to a function using one field | Stamp coupling | "Pass the field; don't couple to the whole shape." |
| `a.getB().getC().doThing()` | Demeter / chain coupling | "Ask the nearest object; add a delegating method." |
| Two services now sharing a DB table / a types library | Cross-service coupling | "This couples deploys. Is the boundary real?" |
| `_privateField` accessed from another class | Content coupling | "Go through a public method." |

### Review comment templates

> "`OrderService` now imports `StripeClient` directly. That's a volatile vendor dependency in our domain — let's depend on a `PaymentGateway` port we own and inject Stripe at the edge, so swapping or faking it doesn't ripple."

> "`process(data, isAdmin)` switches on the flag internally — that's control coupling. Two named methods (`processForAdmin` / `processForUser`) would let each caller pick, and each method reads straight through."

> "This passes the whole `User` to `canCheckout(user)` but only reads `user.balance`. Pass the balance — otherwise every change to `User`'s shape risks this function."

> "These two services now both read the `orders` table. That couples their schemas and deploys. Can one own the data and expose it, so the boundary is real?"

## Catching Over-Decoupling Too

The senior/professional differentiator: **review pushes back on needless indirection as hard as on coupling.** Over-decoupling is the failure mode that *passes* most reviews because it looks disciplined. It isn't.

| Over-decoupling smell | Review ask |
|---|---|
| New interface with exactly one implementation, no test fake needed | "What's the second implementation? If hypothetical, use the concrete type." |
| A direct call replaced by an event for two things that still change together | "These share the event's shape — they're still coupled. Is the event buying real independence, or just hiding the dependency?" |
| A new microservice split through a tightly-coupled cluster | "Can these deploy independently? If not, this is a distributed-monolith seam." |
| A mapper/DTO layer between two modules that share an owner and change rate | "This indirection isn't earning its keep; the boundary isn't real." |
| Generic `Manager`/`Handler`/`Dispatcher` abstraction over one concrete flow | "The generality has one case — inline it." |

> The single best anti-over-decoupling question: **"What real variation does this seam enable *today*?"** "Flexibility" / "future-proofing" / "best practice" is a red flag, not an answer. A seam with no present second side is the [wrong abstraction](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md) — load-bearing indirection that obscures the flow and resists removal.

## Measuring Coupling in Production

You cannot manage coupling you can't see. Choose metrics that track it honestly — and that catch *both* over- and under-coupling.

| Metric | Tracks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Afferent/efferent (Ca/Ce)** | Static coupling degree & direction | `jdepend`, `NDepend`, `import-linter` (Py), `madge` (JS) |
| **Instability `I = Ce/(Ca+Ce)`** | Whether deps point toward stability | Flag stable modules depending on unstable ones |
| **Distance from main sequence `D`** | Over/under-abstraction at component scale | High `D` = Zone of Pain or Uselessness |
| **Change-coupling (logical/temporal)** | Files that *actually* change together in git history | **The ground-truth metric** — surfaces real coupling static tools miss |
| **Fan-in / fan-out per module** | Hotspots everyone depends on | High fan-in + high churn = danger |
| **Cyclic dependencies** | Bidirectional coupling | Cycles are the worst structural coupling; gate against new ones |
| **Per-request service hop count** | Distributed-monolith signal | Rising synchronous fan-out = network-ified coupling |

### The honest-measurement rules

- **Change-coupling (from git history) beats static analysis** for finding *real* coupling. If two files change together in 80% of commits, they're coupled — regardless of whether a static tool sees an import. Tools: `code-maat`, `git-of-theseus`, CodeScene. This catches *essential* coupling that decoupling tactics merely hid.
- **Gate cyclic dependencies in CI.** A new cycle between packages is the one coupling regression worth blocking the build over — cycles make modules undeployable and untestable independently.
- **Watch instability *direction*, not just magnitude.** The defect is a stable module depending on a volatile one (Zone of Pain), which raw Ce won't show. Pair `I` with abstractness.
- **The real metric is the outcome:** lead time for changes and change-failure rate (DORA). Rising coupling shows up as features taking longer and breaking more. If those degrade, coupling got worse no matter what static numbers say.

> Don't report "we reduced coupling" by pointing at one decoupled class. Point at change-coupling dropping, a cycle removed, or a stable module no longer importing a volatile one — the measures that reflect *changeability*.

---

## Team Conventions

Codify these so the appropriate level of coupling is the default, not a per-PR debate:

1. **Dependencies point inward / toward stability.** Domain depends on nothing volatile; infra depends on domain. Enforce with an architecture-fitness test (`import-linter`, ArchUnit) in CI.
2. **No new package cycles.** A CI gate fails the build on a new cyclic dependency.
3. **Concrete first; interface on the second implementation** (test fakes are the documented exception). No one-implementation interfaces in new code "to decouple."
4. **No shared mutable globals/singletons** for business state. Config is read-only and injected.
5. **No boolean flags that switch behaviour** — split the method.
6. **No cross-service database sharing.** Each service owns its data; others access it through an API, not the table.
7. **Events buy independence, not tidiness.** Use an event only when producer and consumer genuinely evolve independently; otherwise call directly.
8. **One-way doors get a design note.** New service boundaries, public contracts, and shared schemas are reviewed deliberately — everything internal is allowed to stay direct and emerge a seam later.

These encode the senior reasoning so reviewers cite a policy, not a personal taste, and juniors get it right by default.

## Decoupling Legacy Systems Safely

Greenfield low coupling is easy. The professional reality is **reducing coupling in a system that's already a tangle, under-tested, and in production.** Incremental, test-guarded, opportunistic — never a rewrite.

### The sequence

1. **Find the real coupling with change-coupling analysis.** Run `code-maat`/CodeScene over git history to see which files actually change together. This points you at the *essential* coupling worth attacking — not whatever the import graph happens to show.
2. **Pin behaviour with characterization tests** around the seam you're about to cut. You can't safely move a dependency you can't test.
3. **Introduce a seam, then invert.** Extract an interface the consumer owns; make the concrete dependency implement it; inject it. Smallest scope first (one volatile boundary), in small commits.
4. **Break cycles before anything else.** A cyclic dependency makes everything else harder; break it (move the shared thing to a third module, or invert one edge) early.
5. **Use the Strangler Fig for large couplings.** Build the decoupled replacement behind the existing interface and migrate callers incrementally — never big-bang.

### Sprout, wrap, and the seam toolkit

For untestable coupled code, use Michael Feathers' techniques (*Working Effectively with Legacy Code*): **Sprout Method/Class** (new behaviour in a new, testable unit the legacy code calls), **Wrap Method** (decorate without modifying), and **dependency-breaking seams** (parameterize a hidden dependency, extract-and-override). These let you introduce a seam *without first having tests*, then test through the seam.

### What *not* to do in legacy code

- **Don't decouple without characterization tests** — cutting a dependency can silently change ordering/behaviour (temporal coupling bites here).
- **Don't network-ify to "decouple."** Splitting a coupled cluster into services without genuine independence produces a distributed monolith — strictly worse.
- **Don't replace coupling with over-decoupling.** Swapping a god-class for fifteen one-method interfaces and an event bus isn't progress; it's a different unmaintainable shape.
- **Don't boil the ocean.** A standalone "decoupling initiative" with no feature value dies at the first deadline. Decouple the seams you touch for feature work (Boy Scout Rule).

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The shared global that caused a payments outage

A `static` mutable `Config` map (common coupling) held the active currency rate, written by a refresh job and read across billing. A deploy reordered startup so billing read the map *before* the refresh job populated it (a temporal coupling lurking behind the global). Result: thousands of charges at a zero rate before alarms fired. **Fix:** removed the global; the rate is now an injected, immutable value passed explicitly to billing, loaded once at the composition root. **Lesson:** a shared mutable global is common coupling *and* a temporal-coupling trap — the dependency was invisible in every signature.

### Incident 2: The "decoupling" that became a distributed monolith

A team split a monolith into eight services "to reduce coupling." But the services shared one database, called each other synchronously (a single request fanned out to six hops), and shipped a common `types` library every service had to upgrade in lockstep. A change to one entity required a coordinated deploy of five services. Latency tripled; a single service's outage took down checkout. **Fix:** re-merged three services that were essentially one cohesive concept, gave each remaining service its own data, and moved cross-service calls to async events on real boundaries. **Lesson:** boundaries drawn through *essential* coupling don't decouple — they network-ify it. Decompose on cohesion, not on a wish.

### Incident 3: The interface-per-class codebase nobody could navigate

A codebase mandated "program to an interface" for *every* class. Every service had a one-implementation `IFooService` whose method set was identical to `FooService`. Reading any flow meant jumping interface → impl → interface endlessly; adding a method meant editing two files in lockstep (more coupling between them, not less); and the "testability" the interfaces promised was unused — the impls were pure logic that needed no mocking. **Fix:** deleted the one-implementation interfaces, kept seams only at real boundaries (DB, payment SDK). Navigation halved; the diff was net-negative thousands of lines. **Lesson:** indirection is not decoupling. A one-implementation interface adds a hop and removes no dependency — and the team had institutionalized the [wrong abstraction](../../04-solid/05-dip-dependency-inversion/senior.md).

### Incident 4: The "harmless" reorder that broke a hidden temporal coupling

An engineer reordered two calls in a setup routine to "clean it up," not knowing the first registered a handler the second relied on (temporal coupling, undocumented). A whole class of webhooks silently stopped processing for hours. **Fix:** made the dependency explicit — the second call now *takes* the registration result as a parameter, so it can't run first. **Lesson:** temporal coupling is invisible coupling; the cure is to make the ordering structurally impossible to get wrong, not to add a comment.

## Cheat Sheet

```text
ENFORCE   ask: "what must A KNOW about B — can it know less?"
          and: "what real variation does this seam enable TODAY?"

PUSH DOWN content→method · global→param · flag→split · whole-obj→field · chain→ask

DIRECTION dependencies point toward stability (unstable → stable).
          stable + concrete = ZONE OF PAIN → depend on an abstraction (DIP).

DON'T     one-impl interface ("indirection ≠ decoupling")
          event for must-change-together things ("fake decoupling")
          service split through essential coupling ("distributed monolith")

MEASURE   change-coupling (git history) · Ca/Ce + I + direction ·
          cyclic deps (gate in CI) · DORA lead time & change-failure rate
          NOT "one class decoupled"

LEGACY    change-coupling to find it → characterization tests → seam + invert →
          break cycles first → Strangler Fig → opportunistic, small, never big-bang.

GOAL      APPROPRIATE coupling — minimal & toward-stability, NOT zero,
          NOT max-indirection. low coupling + high cohesion.
