# Feature Envy — Middle

> **What?** A working catalogue for detecting Feature Envy in real code and fixing it with the right refactoring. The junior file taught the smell; this file teaches you to *find* it consistently, *measure* it roughly, *choose* between Move Method / Extract+Move / Replace Data Value With Object, and apply *Tell Don't Ask* as the underlying design force.
> **How?** Walk through every method longer than ten lines and ask the four detection questions in section 2. When one answers "yes", pick the matching refactoring from section 4 and apply it as a small, reviewable diff — never as a sweeping rewrite.

---

## 1. Detection — the four questions

Open the method. Ask, in order:

1. **What does it touch?** Count the *distinct objects* the method reads from. If exactly one foreign object dominates, you're in classic Feature Envy territory. If two or three foreign objects share the load, you may have *Inappropriate Intimacy* across multiple classes instead (see the sibling topic [`../05-inappropriate-intimacy/`](../05-inappropriate-intimacy/)).
3. **What is its name?** Methods named `xFor(B)`, `xOf(B)`, `summariseB`, `processB`, `validateB` are advertising envy in their names.
4. **What is its return type?** A method on `A` that returns *something computed from `B`'s state* — a discount on `Customer`, a label from `Address`, a tax from `Region` — almost always belongs on `B`.

If two or more of the four answer "yes", schedule the refactor. If all four fire, do it now.

---

## 2. A worked example — three-stage refactor

We'll take a realistic envious method and refactor it in three passes: *Extract Method* to isolate the envy, *Move Method* to relocate it, then *clean up the getters* that the envy was using.

```java
// Stage 0 — original
public class InvoiceProcessor {
    public InvoiceSummary summarise(Invoice invoice, Customer customer) {
        // local scaffolding (this isn't envy)
        InvoiceSummary summary = new InvoiceSummary(invoice.getId());

        // foreign block — every line reads Customer
        BigDecimal tier;
        if (customer.getMembershipTier().equals("GOLD")) tier = new BigDecimal("0.15");
        else if (customer.getMembershipTier().equals("SILVER")) tier = new BigDecimal("0.10");
        else tier = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        BigDecimal loyalty = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        if (customer.getLoyaltyPoints() > 1000) loyalty = new BigDecimal("5");
        if (customer.getYearsActive() > 5) loyalty = loyalty.add(new BigDecimal("2.50"));
        BigDecimal discount = invoice.getSubtotal().multiply(tier).add(loyalty);

        // local: assembling the summary
        summary.setSubtotal(invoice.getSubtotal());
        summary.setDiscount(discount);
        summary.setTotal(invoice.getSubtotal().subtract(discount));
        return summary;
    }
}
```

Five getter calls on `Customer`, two on `Invoice`. The `Customer` block is the envious one — it's pure computation about `Customer`'s state. Refactor in three passes:

### Pass 1 — Extract Method

Isolate the envious block as a private method, *still on `InvoiceProcessor`*. This is a mechanical IDE refactor.

```java
public class InvoiceProcessor {
    public InvoiceSummary summarise(Invoice invoice, Customer customer) {
        InvoiceSummary summary = new InvoiceSummary(invoice.getId());
        BigDecimal discount = computeDiscount(invoice.getSubtotal(), customer);
        summary.setSubtotal(invoice.getSubtotal());
        summary.setDiscount(discount);
        summary.setTotal(invoice.getSubtotal().subtract(discount));
        return summary;
    }

    private BigDecimal computeDiscount(BigDecimal subtotal, Customer customer) {
        BigDecimal tier;
        if (customer.getMembershipTier().equals("GOLD")) tier = new BigDecimal("0.15");
        else if (customer.getMembershipTier().equals("SILVER")) tier = new BigDecimal("0.10");
        else tier = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        BigDecimal loyalty = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        if (customer.getLoyaltyPoints() > 1000) loyalty = new BigDecimal("5");
        if (customer.getYearsActive() > 5) loyalty = loyalty.add(new BigDecimal("2.50"));
        return subtotal.multiply(tier).add(loyalty);
    }
}
```

The envy is now in a single method, signposted as "this reads `Customer` extensively". The next move is mechanical.

### Pass 2 — Move Method

Move `computeDiscount` to `Customer`. The signature drops the `Customer` parameter (it becomes `this`); `subtotal` stays.

```java
public class Customer {
    private String membershipTier;
    private int loyaltyPoints;
    private int yearsActive;

    public BigDecimal discountOn(BigDecimal subtotal) {
        BigDecimal tier = switch (membershipTier) {
            case "GOLD"   -> new BigDecimal("0.15");
            case "SILVER" -> new BigDecimal("0.10");
            default       -> BigDecimal.ZERO;
        };
        BigDecimal loyalty = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        if (loyaltyPoints > 1000) loyalty = new BigDecimal("5");
        if (yearsActive > 5) loyalty = loyalty.add(new BigDecimal("2.50"));
        return subtotal.multiply(tier).add(loyalty);
    }
}

public class InvoiceProcessor {
    public InvoiceSummary summarise(Invoice invoice, Customer customer) {
        InvoiceSummary s = new InvoiceSummary(invoice.getId());
        BigDecimal discount = customer.discountOn(invoice.getSubtotal());
        s.setSubtotal(invoice.getSubtotal());
        s.setDiscount(discount);
        s.setTotal(invoice.getSubtotal().subtract(discount));
        return s;
    }
}
```

### Pass 3 — Clean up the getters

`getMembershipTier`, `getLoyaltyPoints`, `getYearsActive` were only used by the envious code. Check for other callers (`grep` or *Find Usages*). If none, delete the getters. If a few callers exist, evaluate whether each is also envious — usually they are, and you have a whole cluster of moves to do.

This three-pass discipline keeps each commit small and reviewable. The build passes after pass 1. The build passes after pass 2. The build passes after pass 3. No big-bang rewrite, no broken master, no scary diff.

## 3. The refactoring catalogue

Fowler's *Refactoring* (2nd ed., Addison-Wesley, 2018) lists the moves you'll use. The right move depends on *what's envious*.

| Symptom                                              | Refactoring                          | Fowler reference        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Whole method is envious of one class                 | **Move Method**                      | *Refactoring* ch. 8     |
| Part of a method is envious                          | **Extract Method**, then **Move Method** | *Refactoring* ch. 6, 8 |
| Envious of a primitive (e.g., a `String` representing a date) | **Replace Data Value with Object**, then Move Method | *Refactoring* ch. 7 |
| Envy is split across two classes equally             | **Move Method** *and* **Move Field** | *Refactoring* ch. 8     |
| Envious method passes the foreign object through many getters | Fix Law of Demeter first (Hide Delegate) | *Refactoring* ch. 7 |
| Many envious methods on many callers → field belongs elsewhere | **Move Field**                  | *Refactoring* ch. 8     |
| Foreign data is just a property bag with envy everywhere | Promote to a real class with behaviour (Replace Data Class) | — |

The cluster *Extract Method + Move Method + Move Field* together is the bread-and-butter combination. Most refactors need two of the three.

## 4. Tell Don't Ask — the underlying force

Feature Envy is a *symptom*. The disease is that the envious method is *asking* the foreign object for its raw fields and computing the answer outside, when it should *tell* the foreign object what to do and trust it to answer.

Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas put this in *The Pragmatic Programmer* (Addison-Wesley, 1999):

> "Don't ask an object for the information you need to do a job; instead, ask the object that has the information to do the job for you."

Practical translation: a method that reads `customer.getX()`, `customer.getY()`, `customer.getZ()` and then computes `f(x, y, z)` should be replaced by a method `customer.f()`. The information moves nowhere — the *responsibility* moves to where the information lives.

```java
// Asking — every caller knows the rule
if (account.getBalance().compareTo(amount) >= 0
        && account.getStatus() == Status.ACTIVE
        && !account.isFrozen()) {
    transfer(account, amount);
}

// Telling — Account decides whether it can
if (account.canDebit(amount)) {
    transfer(account, amount);
}
```

The second form has *one* place where the "can this account be debited" rule lives. The first has the rule splattered across every caller, each of which will drift independently when a new condition (`isUnderInvestigation`) is added.

Tell Don't Ask also helps thread-safety: `account.canDebit(amount)` can be synchronised internally; the asking form has the check-then-act race built in.

---

## 5. The Law of Demeter connection

Demeter's Law (Ian Holland, Karl Lieberherr, 1987 — see `../../03-design-principles/03-law-of-demeter/`): a method on `A` should only talk to (a) itself, (b) its parameters, (c) objects it creates, and (d) its own fields. *Not* to objects reached through chains.

```java
// Demeter violation — chain through three classes
String city = order.getCustomer().getAddress().getCity();

// Often co-occurs with Feature Envy on the same chain
String label = order.getCustomer().getName() + ", "
             + order.getCustomer().getAddress().getStreet() + ", "
             + order.getCustomer().getAddress().getCity();
```

When you see a long chain like this, two smells exist at once: Demeter violation (your code knows the internal shape of `Order → Customer → Address`) and Feature Envy (the formatting belongs on `Address`, possibly on `Customer`). Fix Demeter first — *Hide Delegate* introduces a method on `Order` that delegates inward:

```java
public class Order {
    public String shippingLabel() {
        return customer.shippingLabel();
    }
}
public class Customer {
    public String shippingLabel() {
        return name + ", " + address.singleLine();
    }
}
public class Address {
    public String singleLine() {
        return street + ", " + city;
    }
}
```

Each class now exposes a single high-level method and hides its internals. The chain is gone; the envy is gone.

---

## 6. False positives — methods that *look* envious but aren't

Three patterns that fire detection rules but are *correct* designs:

**Mappers and projectors.** A method whose job is to translate between layers (`OrderEntity → OrderDto`, `Aggregate → ReadModel`) will read every field of one object and assemble another. Tools flag this; reviewers shouldn't. The mapper is *intentionally* the seam between layers — moving the mapping onto the entity would couple the domain to the DTO format.

```java
// Looks envious, is correct — this is a mapper
public class OrderDtoMapper {
    public OrderDto toDto(Order order) {
        return new OrderDto(
            order.getId().toString(),
            order.getCustomer().getName(),
            order.getTotal().toPlainString(),
            order.getStatus().name()
        );
    }
}
```

**Comparators and policies.** A `Comparator<Order>` compares two `Order` instances. Of course it reads both objects' fields — that's its definition. The behaviour doesn't belong on `Order` because comparison criteria vary (by date, by total, by customer); each strategy is its own class.

**Visitors.** A `BalanceSheetVisitor.visit(Asset a)` reads every field of `a`. The Visitor pattern's whole point is to put *operations* on one class and *data* on another. Senior file (`senior.md`) treats this in detail.

If you've identified a method as one of these three, your detection was right — but the move is "leave alone", not "refactor".

---

## 7. When the envy is across an aggregate boundary

In Domain-Driven Design, an *aggregate* is a cluster of objects treated as one unit. Inside the aggregate, methods reading sibling objects' fields are normal — they're inside the encapsulation boundary. Cross-aggregate envy is the bug.

```java
// Inside one aggregate — not envy, just internal collaboration
public class Order {                          // aggregate root
    private final List<LineItem> items;       // owned by Order

    public BigDecimal total() {
        return items.stream()
                .map(LineItem::lineTotal)     // reads LineItem; both inside the aggregate
                .reduce(BigDecimal.ZERO, BigDecimal::add);
    }
}

// Across aggregates — this is real envy and a DDD violation
public class Order {
    public BigDecimal discountedTotal(Customer customer) {
        // Customer is a separate aggregate;
        // reaching into its loyalty fields is cross-boundary envy
    }
}
```

The rule of thumb: envy *inside* an aggregate is normal; envy *across* aggregates breaks the bounded context and is the real smell. The fix is either to bring the data inside (sometimes — usually wrong), or to pass a value object that captures *only* the relevant information (right — sometimes called a *parameter object*).

## 8. Detection tooling

| Tool          | What it flags                                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IntelliJ IDEA | Inspection "Feature Envy" under *Class structure* — configurable threshold for foreign vs local accesses. |
| SonarJava     | Indirect — rules `S1448` (Methods should not have too many lines), `S3776` (Cognitive Complexity), `S1188` (Anonymous classes too large) often fire together with envy. `S3398` flags methods that should be moved to a parameter's class. |
| PMD           | `LawOfDemeter` rule catches the chain-of-getters that often signals envy. |
| Checkstyle    | `ClassDataAbstractionCoupling` and `ClassFanOutComplexity` give cluster-level signals. |
| JArchitect / NDepend | `LCOM` (Lack of Cohesion of Methods) — high LCOM on `A` while `B`'s methods are short can hint that `A` is hoarding behaviour that should be on `B`. |


---

## 9. A common gotcha — envy on a record

Records (JEP 395, Java 14+) make Feature Envy easier to commit, because records *invite* outside computation by being pure data carriers.

```java
public record Customer(String tier, int loyaltyPoints, int yearsActive) {}

// Smelly — Order computing things from the record's fields
public class Order {
    public BigDecimal discount(Customer c) {
        if (c.tier().equals("GOLD")) ...
        if (c.loyaltyPoints() > 1000) ...
    }
}
```

Records can absolutely have methods. They are *value objects*, not anaemic DTOs. Add the behaviour:

```java
public record Customer(String tier, int loyaltyPoints, int yearsActive) {

    public BigDecimal discountOn(BigDecimal subtotal) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The compiler-generated accessors stay (`tier()`, `loyaltyPoints()`); your domain methods join them. The record is still a value carrier — its single responsibility is "a customer's loyalty data plus the rules for using it". That's one responsibility, not two.

---

## 10. Quick rules

- **Detect:** more foreign accesses than local, suspicious method name, returns a computed property of the foreign object → schedule a move.
- **Fix small:** Extract Method first, Move Method second, clean up getters third. Three small commits, not one giant diff.
- **Demeter:** chains like `a.getB().getC().getD()` usually hide envy two classes deep. Fix Demeter first (Hide Delegate), then envy is often gone.
- **Tell Don't Ask:** prefer `account.canDebit(amount)` to `if (account.getBalance() ≥ amount && ...)`.
- **Records:** records can have methods. Anaemic records that exist only for outside code to read are still a smell.
- **Aggregates:** envy *inside* a DDD aggregate is internal collaboration; envy *across* aggregates is the real bug.
- **False positives:** mappers, comparators, visitors *intentionally* read another class's fields. Don't refactor them.

## 11. What's next

| Topic                                                              | File              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Legitimate envy (Strategy, Visitor), IntelliJ + SonarJava in depth | `senior.md`        |
| Architectural variants — anaemic services, DTOs, DDD aggregates    | `professional.md`  |

---

**Memorize this:** Extract the envious block, Move it to where its data lives, then delete the getters that supported it. Three commits, three letter grades up on the code review.

1. Explain Feature Envy in your own words and name the problem it solves.
2. How would you apply the ideas around Detection — the four questions, A worked example — three-stage refactor, The refactoring catalogue in a realistic engineering change?
3. What failure mode or misuse should you look for, and what evidence would reveal it?
4. Which local design trade-off would make you choose or reject Feature Envy in an existing codebase?
5. What observable result would convince you that the approach improved the system?
