## Introduction

> Focus: **design trade-offs** and **system-level reasoning**

At the senior level, *optimize for deletion* stops being a tidiness heuristic and becomes a **stance in the oldest argument in software design: reuse versus independence.** The industry's default value system — inherited from object-orientation, framework culture, and a misread of DRY — treats reuse and abstraction as unalloyed goods. tef's essay, Rob Pike's proverb, and Sandi Metz's "the wrong abstraction" are a coordinated rebuttal: **reuse has a cost, and that cost is deletability.** Every time you make code reusable, you make it depended-upon, and depended-upon code is code you can no longer remove.

A senior must hold three hard truths simultaneously and know which applies where:

1. **Reuse and deletability are genuinely opposed.** You cannot maximize both; you choose per boundary.
2. **The wrong abstraction is more expensive than duplication** — but *some* shared kernels must be DRY, and conflating the two is a different failure.
3. **Deletability is the load-bearing property for evolvability**, and it is purchasable, even retroactively, via strangler-fig and seam-building.

---

## Reuse and Deletability Are in Direct Tension

State it plainly:

> **Reusable code is depended-upon code. Depended-upon code is hard to delete. Therefore reuse and deletability trade off against each other — you cannot maximize both.**

```
   reuse  ───────────────────────────────────►  more dependents
                                                        │
                                                        ▼
                                                 harder to delete
                                                 harder to change
```

This dissolves the naive belief that "make it reusable" is always good. Reuse is good *when the thing being reused is stable knowledge that genuinely belongs to all its dependents* — a math library, a protocol codec, a domain invariant. Reuse is a liability *when it couples things that should evolve independently* — two features that merely look alike, two services that should release on their own schedule, a "platform" built for one client.

The senior synthesis is **not** "never reuse." It is: **choose your reuse boundaries deliberately, knowing each one is a deletability sacrifice.** A small number of well-chosen, stable shared kernels (high reuse, accepted low deletability) surrounded by many independent, bounded, even slightly-duplicated features (low reuse, high deletability) is the shape of a system that lasts. The failure is *uniform* reuse — DRYing everything — which maximizes coupling and minimizes deletability everywhere.

This is the same insight [orthogonality](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/06-orthogonality/) encodes: unrelated things kept unrelated stay independently changeable and deletable. Reuse, applied indiscriminately, destroys orthogonality.

---

## The DRY–Deletability Conflict, Rigorously

The middle level gave the decision rule (*would a change to one force the same change to all?*). The senior level needs the underlying theory: **connascence** (Meilir Page-Jones), the precise vocabulary of coupling. (See [Connascence](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/03-connascence/).)

Two pieces of code are **connascent** if changing one requires changing the other to keep the system correct. The key insight for this topic:

> **DRY's job is to eliminate connascence by giving shared knowledge one home. But DRYing *coincidental* similarity *manufactures* connascence where none existed — strengthening coupling and destroying deletability.**

So the DRY-vs-deletability question becomes precise:

- **Real duplication = pre-existing connascence (of meaning/algorithm) spread across locations.** The coupling is already there, latent and dangerous (forget a copy → bug). DRYing it *localizes* the connascence to one place — strictly an improvement, and *more* deletable (one home to remove, not five).
- **Coincidental similarity = no connascence.** The pieces look alike but a change to one need not change the other. DRYing them *creates* connascence — now they must change together though they had no reason to. This *reduces* deletability: you can no longer remove one without the other.

```
   REAL duplication (connascence already exists, scattered)
        A ──┐
        B ──┼─► same hidden rule   → DRY localizes it → MORE deletable
        C ──┘

   COINCIDENTAL similarity (no connascence)
        A      (looks like)      B   → DRY WELDS them → LESS deletable
        independent today                 (manufactured coupling)
```

The reframing that resolves the apparent contradiction: **DRY done right and optimize-for-deletion are the same goal — minimize connascence.** DRY removes *existing* connascence (good for deletability); optimize-for-deletion stops you from *creating new* connascence via premature abstraction. They only *appear* to conflict when "DRY" is misapplied to mean "merge anything that looks alike" — which is not DRY at all, but coincidental coupling wearing DRY's clothes.

---

## When the Wrong Abstraction Beats Duplication

Sandi Metz crystallized the senior heuristic: **"duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction."** The mechanism, in deletability terms:

1. You see two similar code paths and extract a shared abstraction. *(Coupling created.)*
2. A requirement makes one caller need slightly different behavior. You add a parameter/flag. *(Abstraction starts diverging from its callers.)*
3. More callers, more flags. The abstraction becomes a conditional maze serving callers with little in common. *(Coupling now spans unrelated features.)*
4. The abstraction is load-bearing for N callers — so it is *risky and expensive* to remove. *(Deletability destroyed.)*

The duplication you avoided would have been *deletable*: each copy independent, removable in isolation, modifiable without fear. The abstraction you created is *not*: removing the invoice feature now means untangling it from the packing-slip, customs, and receipt features that share the megafunction.

> The wrong abstraction's true cost is not that it's ugly — it's that it is **un-deletable coupling**. It gets more expensive every day because every new caller deepens the entanglement, and removing it requires un-merging all of them at once.

This is *why* this principle ranks deletability above naive DRY: a clear, independent duplication preserves the property (deletability) that makes future change cheap; a premature abstraction destroys it.

---

## Escaping a Wrong Abstraction by Re-Introducing Duplication

The recovery is counterintuitive and worth internalizing: **to make a wrong abstraction deletable, first re-introduce the duplication.**

```python
# BEFORE — one "DRY" exporter, now a flag-soup serving 3 divergent callers.
def export(records, fmt="csv", header=True, gzip=False, dialect=None, redact=()):
    rows = [_redact(r, redact) for r in records] if redact else records
    if fmt == "csv":    out = _to_csv(rows, header, dialect)
    elif fmt == "json": out = _to_json(rows)        # header/dialect ignored
    else:               raise ValueError(fmt)
    return _gz(out) if gzip else out
# Un-deletable: the audit, API, and archive features all lean on this one function.
```

```python
# AFTER — inline back to each caller; re-extract ONLY genuinely shared atoms.
def export_audit_csv(records):                       # independent, deletable
    return _to_csv([_redact(r, PII_FIELDS) for r in records], header=True)

def export_api_json(records):                        # independent, deletable
    return _to_json(records)

def export_archive_csv(records):                     # independent, deletable
    return _gz(_to_csv(records, header=False))

# _to_csv / _to_json / _gz stay shared — they ARE shared knowledge (true connascence).
```

The intermediate state has *more* duplication on purpose. That is correct: the flag-driven megafunction was *worse* than duplication because it was un-deletable. After inlining, each exporter is independently removable; the real shared atoms (`_to_csv`, `_gz`) remain DRY because they encode genuine shared knowledge. **We removed the wrong abstraction, not all abstraction.**

The general algorithm (safe in production at [Professional](professional.md)):

```
1. Characterize every caller of the over-general abstraction with tests.
2. Inline the abstraction's body back into each caller (now duplicated, but clear).
3. Simplify each caller independently — delete the flags/branches it never used.
4. Re-extract ONLY the atoms that are genuinely shared knowledge across callers.
5. Delete the old abstraction.
```

## Shared Kernels: When DRY Must Win

The balanced senior position requires the *other* boundary too: **some things should be DRY, and treating optimize-for-deletion as "always duplicate" is its own failure.**

A **shared kernel** is knowledge that genuinely belongs to all its dependents and *must* stay consistent:

- A **domain invariant** — how money is rounded, how a tax is computed, the canonical definition of "an active account."
- A **protocol / wire format** — both sides must serialize identically (connascence of algorithm); duplicating it guarantees version skew.
- A **security or compliance rule** — duplicating a permission check across ten endpoints means a fix must land in ten places; one will be missed.

For these, **duplication is the bug**, not the safe choice. The connascence is *real and inherent*: a change to the rule *must* propagate everywhere. Centralizing it is the only way to keep the system correct, and the deletability you sacrifice is a correct trade — you wouldn't *want* to delete a tax rule from only one of three places.

> The art is **scoping the kernel as small as possible.** Share the *invariant* (the rounding rule), not the *feature* (the invoice). The smaller and more stable the shared kernel, the less deletability you sacrifice for the consistency you need. Over-large shared kernels — a "core" module that accretes everything — are the disease; tight, stable kernels are the cure.

The senior rule of thumb: **DRY the invariants; duplicate the features.** Invariants are stable shared knowledge (reuse pays); features diverge and get retired (deletability pays).

## Deletability Across Boundaries: Modules, Services, Data

Deletability's cost scales with the *kind* of boundary the coupling crosses — and so does the wisdom of "a little copying is better than a little dependency."

| Boundary | Cost of shared dependency | Deletability guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **Within a module** | Low (a local refactor) | Share freely; the rule of three governs |
| **Across modules (same deploy)** | Medium (compile/test coupling) | Share invariants; duplicate small/divergent helpers |
| **Across services (independent deploy)** | **High** (couples release cycles) | **Prefer copying.** A shared lib means you can't delete/change one service's copy independently |
| **Into the data layer (schema)** | **Highest** ([one-way door](../05-avoid-premature-optimization/)) | A feature that leaks into the schema is barely deletable; isolate persistence behind a seam |

The deepest deletability trap is **data**. Code is reversible; a schema is not. A feature whose concept is baked into a shared table or column requires a *migration* to delete, and migrations are coordinated, risky, irreversible events. This is why "optimize for deletion" applies most aggressively to *code* (cheap to delete) and yields to deliberate up-front design at *data and protocol boundaries* (expensive to delete). The reversibility test from [premature optimization](../05-avoid-premature-optimization/) governs here: cheap-to-reverse → optimize for deletion freely; expensive-to-reverse → design the boundary deliberately, then keep the *code* on either side deletable.

> Across a deployment boundary, a shared library is a *distributed* un-deletable dependency: now two teams' release schedules are welded together. The Go proverb's force grows with the boundary — *across services, copy almost always wins.*

---

## Strangler-Fig: Deleting What Cannot Be Deleted

What about code that's *already* un-deletable — the legacy subsystem everything depends on? You cannot cut it out; the ripple is the whole system. The senior technique is the **strangler-fig pattern** (Martin Fowler): you don't delete the old thing directly — you make it *progressively unnecessary*, then delete it whole.

```
   1. Introduce a SEAM in front of the old subsystem (a façade/interface).
   2. Route all callers through the seam (they no longer know the impl).
   3. Build the NEW implementation behind the same seam.
   4. Migrate callers / traffic from old to new, one slice at a time.
   5. When nothing routes to the old impl → its afferent coupling is ZERO →
      it is now DELETABLE → delete it whole.
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C["Callers"] --> S["Seam / façade"]
    S --> OLD["Legacy impl<br/>(was un-deletable)"]
    S -. "migrate slice by slice" .-> NEW["New impl"]
    NEW --> DEL["Old afferent coupling → 0<br/>⇒ delete legacy whole"]
```

The pattern is *literally* a deletability-manufacturing machine: it works by **artificially driving the old subsystem's afferent coupling to zero**, at which point the un-deletable becomes deletable. The seam in step 1 is the same boundary the junior level preached — introduced retroactively. This is how you recover deletability you failed to build in originally, without a big-bang rewrite (which is all risk and no incremental value).

---

## Measuring Deletability

Deletability sounds subjective; it can be measured.

- **Afferent coupling (Ca):** count the modules that depend on the target. High Ca = low deletability, directly. Static-analysis tools report it.
- **"Files to remove a feature" / deletion diff size:** the most honest proxy. Pick a real feature; ask how many files (and migrations) a clean removal touches. Track the trend per feature over time — rising means deletability is eroding.
- **Change-coupling (logical coupling):** mine git history for files that *change together*. This surfaces *hidden* connascence that static imports miss — the real, behavioral dependencies. Files that always change together are effectively one un-deletable unit.
- **Schema entanglement:** does removing the feature require a migration? If yes, it crossed the data one-way door and is intrinsically less deletable.

> The ground-truth metric is the **deletion experiment**: for a representative feature, sketch the PR that removes it. Its size and blast radius *are* the deletability of that part of the system — a fact, not an opinion.

---

## Code Examples — Advanced

### A boundary seam that *increases* deletability (Go)

```go
// The app depends only on this narrow seam — not on any vendor SDK.
type Mailer interface {
    Send(to, subject, body string) error
}

// Each provider is an independent, DELETABLE layer.
type SendgridMailer struct{ key string }
func (m SendgridMailer) Send(to, subject, body string) error { /* sendgrid */ return nil }

type SesMailer struct{ /* aws cfg */ }
func (m SesMailer) Send(to, subject, body string) error { /* ses */ return nil }

// Switching providers = delete one struct, add another. App code untouched.
// Go's structural typing means new providers satisfy Mailer implicitly —
// the language rewards keeping the seam thin and the impls throwaway.
```

This is a *good* abstraction: the seam separates the app from foreign, swappable code. It raises deletability of the vendor layer. Contrast with the wrong abstraction below.

### A premature abstraction that *destroys* deletability (TypeScript)

```typescript
// DON'T: one "reusable" component coupling unrelated features via config.
function GenericList<T>(props: {
  items: T[];
  variant: "invoice" | "cart" | "search" | "admin";   // 4 features, 1 component
  showTax?: boolean; compact?: boolean; redactPII?: boolean;
  legacyLayout?: boolean; locale?: string;
}) { /* a maze of `if (variant === ...)` */ }

// To delete the "search" feature you must edit GenericList and risk the other
// three. The features are welded together by a component that "reused" markup.
```

The fix is the same recovery: split `GenericList` into `InvoiceList`, `CartList`, `SearchList`, `AdminList` — each independently deletable — and extract only the *truly* shared atom (e.g., a `<Row>` with no feature knowledge) if one exists.

## Liabilities

### Liability 1: "Optimize for deletion" as an excuse to never abstract

Taken literally, the principle argues against *all* reuse — copy everything, share nothing. That's a different disaster: scattered invariants, inconsistency bugs, and a codebase where a one-line policy change is a fifty-file edit. The principle is *anti-premature-abstraction*, not *anti-abstraction*. Shared kernels of stable invariants *must* be DRY.

### Liability 2: Mistaking coincidental similarity for a deletion mandate

The flip side of premature DRY: refusing to consolidate *genuine* shared knowledge "for deletability." A tax rule duplicated across ten endpoints is not "independently deletable" — it's a consistency bomb. Use the connascence test, not a reflex.

### Liability 3: Boundaries are not free

Every seam is an indirection — a layer to read, a test surface, a place bugs hide. Building a seam where there's no real boundary (a one-implementation interface day one) is itself premature abstraction that *reduces* deletability. Earn seams at real or foreseeable boundaries; don't sprinkle them.

### Liability 4: Ignoring the data one-way door

Optimizing code for deletion while letting the feature metastasize into the schema is optimizing the cheap thing and neglecting the expensive one. The un-deletable part will be the migration, not the code.

## Pros & Cons at the System Level

| Dimension | Optimize for deletion (bounded, tolerated duplication) | Maximize reuse (consolidate everything) |
|---|---|---|
| Cost to remove a feature | Low — cut the seam | High — every dependent changes |
| Cost to change one behavior | Low — local | High — ripples to all dependents |
| Consistency of true invariants | At risk if you over-duplicate | Strong — single source of truth |
| Coupling | Low | High |
| Code volume | Higher (some duplication) | Lower |
| Best for | Features, divergent cases, cross-service helpers | Stable invariants, protocols, domain rules |
| Failure mode | Scattered invariant → inconsistency bug (cheap fix) | Wrong abstraction → un-deletable maze (expensive un-merge) |

The senior reading: optimize-for-deletion wins on *every evolvability row* for **features and divergent code**, and *loses* exactly on the **consistency-of-invariants row** — which is precisely the place you carve out small, stable, DRY shared kernels. The mature system is mostly deletable features around a thin core of deliberately-shared invariants.
