## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Avoid premature optimization** is the discipline of *not* speeding up code until you have a real, measured reason to. You write the **simplest correct code first**, and you only make it faster *after* a profiler — not a hunch — has shown you which part is actually slow.

The principle gets its name from the most-quoted sentence in software engineering:

> *"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."* — Donald Knuth, 1974

That sentence is also the most-**misquoted** one. People wield it to mean "never think about performance," which is the opposite of what Knuth said. The full quote (below) is a call to **measure first** and then optimize the small part that matters — not a ban on optimizing.

So the principle is really two instructions in one:

1. **Don't** hand-tune code before you know it's a bottleneck. (That's the "premature" part — optimizing too early, on the wrong code.)
2. **Do** optimize the critical part once measurement proves it's critical.

### Why this matters

Optimization is not free. Faster code is almost always **more complex** code: a clever bit-trick, a hand-rolled cache, an unrolled loop, a denormalized field. Every bit of that complexity costs you readability, invites bugs, and is harder to change. If you pay that cost on code that *isn't* slow, you've made your program worse for **zero** speed benefit — because a function that runs for 0.1% of the total time can't make your program meaningfully faster no matter how fast you make it.

The result: most premature optimization is **pure cost.** You traded clarity for a speedup nobody can measure.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write and run **automated tests** — you optimize *after* the code is correct, and tests are what tell you it stays correct.
- **Required:** Comfort with functions, loops, and basic data structures (lists, sets, maps/dictionaries).
- **Helpful:** A first feel for **[KISS](../01-kiss/junior.md)** — the simplest thing that works — since premature optimization is one of the main ways simple code gets complicated.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to **[YAGNI](../02-yagni/junior.md)** — "You Aren't Gonna Need It" — because speculative speed is a close cousin of speculative features.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Optimization** | Changing code to make it use fewer resources (time, memory, I/O) — usually at the cost of simplicity. |
| **Premature optimization** | Optimizing before you know the code is a bottleneck, or optimizing code that isn't one. |
| **Bottleneck / hot spot** | The small part of a program where most of the time is actually spent. |
| **Profiling** | Running a program with a tool that *measures* where time and memory actually go. |
| **Micro-optimization** | A tiny local speedup (a loop tweak, a cheaper operation) that rarely changes the big picture. |
| **Big-O / algorithmic complexity** | How a program's cost grows as the input grows — e.g. `O(n)` vs `O(n²)`. The thing that usually matters most. |
| **Premature pessimization** | The opposite mistake: choosing a *gratuitously slow* approach when an equally simple fast one exists. |

## The Knuth Quote — In Full

Almost everyone quotes seven words. Here is the actual passage, from Donald Knuth's 1974 paper *"Structured Programming with `go to` Statements"*:

> *"Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: **premature optimization is the root of all evil.** Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."*

Read the whole thing and the meaning flips:

- **"noncritical parts"** — Knuth is talking about the code that *doesn't matter* to performance. Optimizing it is a waste.
- **"strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered"** — the cost of optimization is that the code gets harder to debug and maintain.
- **"97% of the time"** — most of your code isn't performance-critical, so most of the time you should *not* be optimizing.
- **"that critical 3%"** — but there *is* a critical part, and Knuth explicitly says **do not pass it up.** Optimizing the hot 3% is the *whole point*; the discipline is finding it (by measuring) instead of guessing.

> Knuth was not saying "never optimize." He was saying: **find the critical 3% by measuring, optimize that, and stop wasting effort on the other 97%.** The famous half is a warning; the forgotten half is a duty.

*(A historical note you'll hear: the line is sometimes attributed to Tony Hoare. Knuth credited the sentiment widely and is the one who put it in print, so it's the Knuth quote in practice.)*

## Make It Work, Make It Right, Make It Fast

Kent Beck compressed the whole discipline into a six-word order of operations:

> **"Make it work, make it right, make it fast."** — Kent Beck

The order is the lesson:

1. **Make it work** — get a correct result, even crudely. Correctness is the floor; nothing else counts until this holds.
2. **Make it right** — clean it up: clear names, no duplication, simple structure. Now it's *maintainable*.
3. **Make it fast** — *only now*, and *only if* you have a measured reason, do you optimize — and you optimize the part the profiler points at.

The trap is jumping straight to step 3. Beginners often write their first draft already worrying about speed ("I'll use a clever loop here to save time"), and end up with code that is slower to *write*, harder to *read*, and — because it was never measured — usually no faster to *run*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    W["MAKE IT WORK<br/>correct result<br/>(crude is fine)"] --> R["MAKE IT RIGHT<br/>clear, simple,<br/>maintainable"]
    R --> Q{Measured a<br/>real bottleneck?}
    Q -- "No" --> STOP["STOP — you're done.<br/>Don't optimize."]
    Q -- "Yes" --> F["MAKE IT FAST<br/>optimize the hot spot,<br/>re-measure"]
```

Notice the gate before "make it fast": **most code never reaches it**, and that's correct.

## Why Premature Optimization Harms

Optimizing too early isn't neutral — it actively damages the code:

| Harm | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Adds complexity** | A clever fast version has more moving parts than the obvious one. It fights [KISS](../01-kiss/junior.md). |
| **Obscures intent** | A hand-tuned loop or bit-trick hides *what* the code is computing behind *how* it's squeezing speed. |
| **Introduces bugs** | More complexity = more places to get it wrong. Off-by-one errors, broken edge cases, cache-invalidation bugs. |
| **Couples to assumptions** | A cache or a precomputed table bakes in assumptions ("this rarely changes") that the next requirement breaks. |
| **Wastes effort** | Time spent speeding up the 97% that wasn't slow is time not spent on features, tests, or the real 3%. |
| **Gets undone anyway** | The optimized code is often deleted or rewritten when requirements change — you optimized something that didn't survive. It fights [YAGNI](../02-yagni/junior.md). |

The single sentence: **you pay a real, certain cost (complexity, bugs, time) for a speed benefit that is usually zero, because the code wasn't on the critical path.**

## Humans Are Terrible at Guessing Hot Spots

Here is the empirical fact that justifies "measure first": **programmers are reliably bad at guessing which part of their code is slow.** Decades of profiling experience say the same thing — the bottleneck is almost never where the author expected.

Why? Because our intuition fixates on code that *looks* expensive (a big nested loop, a "heavy" function name) and ignores the real culprits, which are usually invisible at the source level:

- A function called in a **tight loop a million times** — each call is cheap, but the count is enormous.
- A surprise **database query inside a loop** (the N+1 problem) — looks like one line, costs a thousand round-trips.
- **Memory allocation** or string concatenation that the language quietly does behind a clean-looking expression.
- **I/O** (disk, network) that dwarfs any amount of CPU work nearby.

Because intuition is unreliable, the only honest way to find the hot spot is to **profile** — run a tool that *measures* where the time goes. You'll be surprised most times you do it, and that surprise is exactly why the principle exists.

> Optimize against **data, not intuition.** "I think this is slow" is not a reason to optimize. "The profiler shows this takes 60% of the time" is.

---

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **Profile before optimizing** | A doctor runs tests before prescribing. You don't operate on a patient because of a hunch about which organ hurts. |
| **The 97% / 3% split** | A road network: a few intersections carry most of the traffic. Widening a quiet country lane doesn't reduce the city's congestion. |
| **Premature optimization** | Tuning a race-car engine that's still up on blocks in the garage — you haven't even driven it, so you don't know what's slow. |
| **Micro-optimization on cold code** | Polishing the doorknobs on a house that's on fire. Technically an improvement; completely beside the point. |
| **Optimizing against data** | Following the map's traffic-flow overlay, not your gut feeling about which route "feels" faster. |

## Mental Models

**The intuition:** *"First make it correct and clear. Then, if and only if a measurement proves a part is slow, make that part fast — and nothing else."*

```
   TIME SPENT IN A TYPICAL PROGRAM
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │██ 3% critical (the hot path) — optimize THIS  │
   ├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░│
   │  97% noncritical — DON'T optimize this        │
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   Premature optimization = pouring effort into the 97%.
   The job is to FIND the 3% (by measuring) and optimize it.
```

A second model: optimization is a **loan**. You borrow speed and pay interest in complexity forever after. Sometimes the loan is worth it (the hot 3%). But taking out a loan you don't need — borrowing speed for code that was never slow — means paying interest for nothing.

---

## Code Examples

### A needless micro-optimization that hurts readability (Python)

A junior "optimizes" a sum, convinced the obvious version is wasteful:

```python
# "Optimized" — manual indexing to "avoid iterator overhead"
def total_price(items):
    t = 0
    i = 0
    n = len(items)
    while i < n:
        t += items[i].price * items[i].qty
        i += 1
    return t
```

```python
# Simple — and on any real interpreter, NOT slower in any way that matters
def total_price(items):
    return sum(item.price * item.qty for item in items)
```

The "optimized" version is longer, easier to get wrong (the index bookkeeping), and harder to read — and it doesn't speed up anything you'd ever measure. This is premature optimization in miniature: real cost, imaginary benefit.

### The optimization that actually matters: fix the algorithm (Python)

Now a *real* problem. We want to know which orders belong to known customers:

```python
# SLOW — O(n × m): for each order, scan the whole customer list
def flagged_orders(orders, vip_customers):          # vip_customers is a list
    result = []
    for order in orders:
        if order.customer_id in vip_customers:      # 'in' on a LIST is O(m)
            result.append(order)
    return result
```

With 100,000 orders and 100,000 VIPs, that inner `in` scans the list every time — roughly **10 billion** comparisons. No amount of loop-tweaking saves it. The fix is **algorithmic**, and it's *simpler*, not more complex:

```python
# FAST — O(n + m): a set makes membership O(1)
def flagged_orders(orders, vip_customers):
    vip_ids = set(vip_customers)                    # build once: O(m)
    return [o for o in orders if o.customer_id in vip_ids]  # each check: O(1)
```

This is the key contrast for a junior to internalize: the micro-optimization above made the code **worse for no gain**, while this algorithmic fix made the code **faster *and* cleaner**. Choosing the right data structure isn't "premature optimization" — it's just writing good code.

### A profiling-driven workflow (Python)

When you *do* suspect something is slow, don't guess — measure:

```python
import cProfile, pstats

def main():
    process_all_orders(load_orders())

cProfile.run("main()", "profile.out")

stats = pstats.Stats("profile.out")
stats.sort_stats("cumulative").print_stats(10)   # show the 10 costliest calls
```

```text
   ncalls  tottime  cumtime  function
   100000    0.04     8.91    flagged_orders        ← 8.9s of a 9.2s run lives HERE
        1    0.10     0.30    load_orders
   100000    0.02     0.05    format_receipt        ← tiny; DON'T touch it
```

The profiler points a finger: `flagged_orders` is the 3%. You optimize *that* (the set fix above) and leave `format_receipt` alone — optimizing it would be effort spent in the 97%.

## The One Optimization That Almost Always Wins: Big-O

If you remember one thing: **algorithmic complexity (Big-O) usually dwarfs every micro-optimization.** Picking the right data structure or algorithm beats hand-tuning a loop, by orders of magnitude, on any non-trivial input.

| Approach | What it does | Typical impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Micro-optimization** | Tweak a loop, swap an operator, inline a call | A few percent — and often unmeasurable |
| **Algorithmic fix (Big-O)** | `O(n²)` → `O(n)`, list → set, add an index | 10×, 100×, 1000× on large inputs |

A hand-tuned `O(n²)` loop loses to a plain, readable `O(n)` one the moment the input gets big. So the *first* performance question is never "how do I make this loop faster?" — it's **"is there a fundamentally cheaper approach?"** Fixing `O(n²) → O(n)` is not premature optimization; it's the difference between code that scales and code that falls over. (Deeper at the [Middle](middle.md) level, including Amdahl's Law.)

---

## Best Practices

1. **Make it work, make it right, then make it fast — in that order.** Don't optimize a draft that isn't correct and clean yet.
2. **Measure before you optimize.** A profiler, a timer, a benchmark — *data*, not a hunch. If you can't measure a speedup, you don't have one.
3. **Optimize the hot 3%, ignore the cold 97%.** Spend effort only where measurement says it counts.
4. **Get the Big-O right from the start.** Choosing a set over a list, or an index over a scan, isn't premature — it's just good code.
5. **Keep the simple version around.** When you do optimize, keep the clear code (in a comment or test) so the fast version's intent stays recoverable.
6. **Re-measure after optimizing.** Confirm the change actually helped — sometimes "optimizations" make things slower.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Quoting only "premature optimization is the root of all evil."** Dropping the second half ("…that critical 3%") turns Knuth's advice into an excuse to never optimize.
2. **Optimizing by intuition.** "This *feels* slow" leads you to tune code that isn't on the hot path. Profile instead.
3. **Confusing micro-optimization with design.** Choosing the right data structure (set vs list) is *design*, not premature optimization — don't skip it in the name of "simplicity."
4. **Sacrificing clarity for an unmeasured speedup.** A cryptic one-liner that "saves time" you never measured is a pure loss.
5. **Optimizing the 97%.** Speeding up code that runs rarely or cheaply can't help the total — see Amdahl's Law at [Middle](middle.md).
6. **Premature *pessimization*** — the opposite mistake: deliberately picking a slow approach (an `O(n²)` scan, a query in a loop) when an equally simple fast one exists. Avoiding *premature* optimization is not a license to write *gratuitously* slow code.

---

## Tricky Points

- **"Premature" is the load-bearing word.** Optimization isn't evil; optimization *before measurement* is. The principle tells you *when*, not *whether*.
- **The forgotten 3% is mandatory, not optional.** Knuth said do **not** pass up the critical part. Once you've measured a bottleneck, *not* optimizing it would be the mistake.
- **Algorithmic choice is not "optimization" in the dangerous sense.** Using a hash set instead of a linear scan is just correct engineering. The principle targets *micro*-tuning of *non-bottleneck* code, not "always write the slowest thing." (This distinction — micro-optimization vs design-level performance — is the heart of the [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md) levels.)
- **"Make it fast" can be empty.** For most code, the honest answer to "is it fast enough?" is "yes, already" — and you do nothing. That's a success, not a skipped step.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Quote the **full** Knuth sentence (both halves). What does the second half add?
2. State Kent Beck's three-step order and why "make it fast" is last.
3. Why is profiling necessary — why not just optimize the code that looks slow?
4. Name three concrete harms of optimizing too early.
5. Why does fixing `O(n²) → O(n)` usually beat hand-tuning a loop?
6. What is *premature pessimization*, and how is it the opposite mistake?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THE PRINCIPLE
  Make it WORK → make it RIGHT → make it FAST  (in that order)
  Optimize ONLY after MEASURING a real bottleneck.

KNUTH, IN FULL (don't quote half of it)
  "...premature optimization is the root of all evil.
   Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."
  → measure first, optimize the hot 3%, ignore the cold 97%.

WHY EARLY OPTIMIZATION HARMS
  + complexity  + bugs  + obscured intent  + wasted effort
  - usually ZERO speed benefit (the code wasn't the bottleneck)

DO THIS INSTEAD
  Profile → find the hot path → fix it → re-measure.
  Get Big-O right from the start (set>list, index>scan) — that's design, not premature.

DON'T
  optimize by intuition · sacrifice clarity for unmeasured speed
  · premature PESSIMIZATION (gratuitously slow when fast is just as simple)
```

---

## Summary

- **Avoid premature optimization** = don't speed up code until a **measurement** proves a part is slow; then optimize *that* part.
- The **full Knuth quote** has two halves: forget the 97% noncritical code, but **do not pass up the critical 3%.** Optimization isn't evil — *premature* (un-measured) optimization is.
- **"Make it work, make it right, make it fast"** — in that order. Most code never needs the third step.
- Early optimization **harms**: complexity, obscured intent, bugs, wasted effort — usually for *zero* real speedup (fights [KISS](../01-kiss/junior.md) and [YAGNI](../02-yagni/junior.md)).
- **Profile, don't guess** — humans are terrible at finding hot spots.
- **Big-O usually wins.** Fixing `O(n²) → O(n)` beats any loop tweak, and choosing the right data structure is good design, not premature optimization.
- The opposite mistake is **premature pessimization** — needlessly slow code when fast is just as simple.
