## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — keeping a large, multi-contributor codebase simple over years.

KISS is easy to *agree* with and hard to *sustain*. Every engineer wants clean code in the abstract. Collectively, codebases drift toward complexity: each person adds a "small" abstraction, a "just in case" flag, a layer that matches the framework's tutorial. No single change is unreasonable; the aggregate is a system nobody can change confidently. Complexity is **emergent and incremental** — it arrives one defensible PR at a time.

At the professional level the question is operational: **how do you keep a codebase simple when hundreds of changes land per week from dozens of people with different instincts and different ideas of "simple"?** The answer is a *system*: review standards that name the smells, metrics that make complexity visible without lying, conventions that make the simple path the default, and a disciplined method for clawing back simplicity from legacy code without breaking it.

---

## Enforcing KISS in Code Review

Code review is where simplicity is won or lost, because most over-engineering enters one PR at a time. The professional reviewer pushes back on **additions** as hard as on bugs — which is unnatural, because adding looks like progress and questioning an abstraction looks like obstruction.

### The highest-value review question

> **"What real, present requirement makes this element necessary?"**

Asked of every speculative interface, flag, layer, config option, and generic — this single question prevents most over-engineering. If the honest answer is *"we might need it later,"* the change is a [YAGNI](../02-yagni/professional.md) violation and the element should come out; you can add it the day the need is real. Make this a **normal, non-confrontational** part of review — not an accusation, just the standard bar.

### What to flag

| Smell in the diff | Reviewer response |
|---|---|
| Interface/abstract class with **one** implementation | "What's the second implementation we're anticipating? If hypothetical, use the concrete type." |
| A **generic engine** for one or two concrete cases | "Three named functions would each be clearer. The generality isn't earning its keep." |
| A **clever one-liner** (nested ternary, dense chain) | "Can we name an intermediate or split this? It reads as a puzzle." |
| **Mode flags / `if (caller == X)`** in a shared function | "This braids independent concerns — let's split into clear functions (un-complect)." |
| **Config nobody sets** / hooks nobody calls | "Hard-code it; make it configurable when someone needs to configure it." |
| Deep nesting (4+ levels) | "Guard clauses / extract a helper to flatten this." |

### The crucial caveat: don't reject *essential* complexity

The reviewer's discipline cuts both ways. Before flagging something as "over-engineered," apply the **essential/accidental test** (Brooks): is the complexity coming from the *problem* or the *solution*? A load-bearing seam (a real variation point with two implementations, a persistence boundary that's a one-way door) or irreducible domain logic is **not** over-engineering — flagging it is how you push a team into *under*-engineering. KISS-in-review targets accidental complexity only.

### Review comment templates

> "This `NotificationFactory` has one implementation (email) and one caller. Let's send the email directly and introduce the abstraction when SMS is a real requirement."

> "These two `calculateFee` methods look duplicated, but they encode different rounding rules that happen to share a rate. Merging them couples things that should evolve independently — keep them separate." *(See [DRY](../07-dry/professional.md).)*

> "`process(type, mode, data)` is four jobs behind a switchboard. Three named functions would each be clearer — the generality isn't paying for itself."

> "I'd keep the repository seam here even though it's 'more elements' — storage is a one-way door, and inlining it would make a future migration brutal." *(Essential complexity; see [Senior](senior.md).)*

## Fighting Gold-Plating

**Gold-plating** — adding capability beyond requirements — is the production-scale disease KISS exists to treat. Its roots are organizational, not just technical:

| Root cause | What it looks like | Counter |
|---|---|---|
| **"Future-proofing" culture** | Every feature ships with extension points | YAGNI as a *stated* value; require a present requirement per abstraction |
| **Résumé-driven development** | Patterns/frameworks added to impress | Review bar: simplest thing that works; **complexity** must be justified, not simplicity |
| **Misread requirements** | Building the general case for a specific ask | Confirm scope; build exactly what's asked |
| **Boredom / over-capacity** | A simple task "made interesting" with architecture | Channel energy into tests, docs, the next real feature |
| **Fear of looking junior** | Equating more structure with more skill | Reframe: removing an unneeded element is the senior move |

The cultural reframe a professional must drive:

> **Simplicity is the achievement, not complexity.**

In many teams the person who adds a clever abstraction gets praised and the person who *deletes* one is invisible. Flip that incentive. "I removed the strategy pattern and three classes; the feature still works and the module is 200 lines shorter" should earn more respect than adding them did. A proverb worth putting on the team wall: *"It's harder to delete code than to add it, which is exactly why deleting it is worth more."*

## Measuring Complexity Honestly

You can't manage what you can't see — but KISS's win is mostly **cognitive**, which naive metrics miss or actively misrepresent. The professional chooses metrics that track simplicity and refuses to be fooled by ones that don't.

| Metric | Tracks simplicity? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Cyclomatic complexity** (McCabe) | Partially | Counts branches; flags god functions, but blind to nesting/naming/over-abstraction |
| **Cognitive complexity** (SonarQube) | **Yes** | Penalizes nesting & hard-to-follow flow — closest single proxy for "is this readable?" |
| **Lines of code per method/file** | Weakly | Useful as a *trend*; low LOC can still be cryptic, high LOC can be clear |
| **Elements (classes/indirections) per feature** | **Yes (over-engineering)** | Rising element-count-per-feature is the gold-plating signal |
| **Duplication %** (PMD/CPD) | Partially | Catches textual duplication; **can't** tell knowledge from coincidence |
| **Change-coupling** (files that change together) | **Yes** | Surfaces *real* shared knowledge that duplication tools miss |
| **DORA: lead time / change-failure rate** | **Yes (outcome)** | Ground truth — simple code is changed quickly and safely |

### The honest-measurement rules

- **Use cognitive complexity, not cyclomatic alone**, as the readability gate. Cyclomatic is blind to the things that actually make code hard to read.
- **Beware the method-shredding trap.** A developer can "pass" a cyclomatic gate by exploding logic into fifteen tiny private methods that each score low but are impossible to follow as a whole. The metric is green; the code is *less* simple. (See [Incident 3](#real-incidents).)
- **Watch element-count-per-feature as a trend.** If a comparable feature now takes twice the classes it did a year ago, the codebase is gold-plating.
- **Treat duplication % with suspicion.** A high score may be coincidental similarity that *shouldn't* be merged; pair it with **change-coupling** (git history) to find *real* duplication.
- **The real metric is outcome.** If lead time and change-failure rate degrade, the design got complex regardless of what static metrics say.

> Never report "we reduced complexity" using cyclomatic complexity alone after a clarity/de-abstraction cleanup — it usually won't move, and quoting it makes the report suspect. Report cognitive complexity, element count, and change-coupling.

## Team Conventions for Simplicity

Codify these so simplicity is the default path, not a per-PR fight:

1. **YAGNI is a stated value.** Written in the engineering handbook: *no abstraction without a present requirement.* This gives reviewers explicit license to push back on speculation.
2. **Concrete first; abstraction on the second real case.** No one-implementation interfaces in new code (test seams are the documented exception). Apply the **rule of three** before extracting.
3. **Name after the domain, not the mechanism.** Ban `Manager`/`Helper`/`Util`/`Base`/`Impl`/`Processor` as default names — they signal "I didn't find the concept."
4. **Cognitive-complexity gate in CI**, not cyclomatic-only; cap nesting depth.
5. **Deep modules over shallow wrappers.** A new abstraction must absorb more complexity than it adds; no pass-through layers. (Ousterhout; see [Senior](senior.md).)
6. **Deletions are celebrated.** Track and call out net-negative-LOC PRs that remove complexity safely.
7. **One-way doors get a design note.** Irreversible decisions (schema, public API, protocol, crypto) are reviewed deliberately; everything reversible is allowed to stay minimal and evolve.

These encode the senior reasoning so juniors get it right by default and reviewers cite a *policy*, not a personal taste.

## Simplifying Legacy Systems

Greenfield KISS is easy. The professional reality is **introducing simplicity into a system that is already over-engineered, under-tested, and in production.** The approach is incremental, test-guarded, and opportunistic — never a rewrite.

### The sequence

1. **Pin behavior with characterization tests first.** You cannot simplify safely without a net. Write tests that capture *current* behavior (even bugs) so the change can't silently alter it. (See *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*; [Avoid Premature Optimization](../05-avoid-premature-optimization/professional.md) for the same discipline applied to perf.)
2. **Classify before you cut.** For each piece of complexity, ask: **essential** (the problem needs it — keep, contain) or **accidental** (our solution added it — remove)? Only the accidental kind is KISS's target.
3. **Refactor opportunistically (Boy Scout Rule).** Don't schedule a "simplify the codebase" mega-project — it never finishes and it's all risk. Simplify each file *as you touch it for feature work.* Simplicity compounds through normal changes.
4. **Strangle, don't rewrite.** For a genuinely over-engineered subsystem, build the simpler replacement behind the existing interface and migrate callers incrementally (Strangler Fig), rather than a big-bang rewrite that risks everything at once.

### Removing the *wrong* abstraction safely

Legacy systems are full of premature abstractions (the [Senior](senior.md) death spiral, now load-bearing). The safe removal:

```text
1. Characterize: tests around every caller of the over-general abstraction.
2. Inline: push its body back into each caller (now duplicated, but clear).
3. Simplify each caller independently — delete the flags it never used.
4. Re-extract ONLY the parts that are genuinely shared knowledge.
5. Delete the old abstraction.
```

The intermediate state has *more* duplication **on purpose** — that's correct: the wrong abstraction was worse than the duplication (Sandi Metz). This is "re-introduce duplication to escape the wrong abstraction," executed safely with characterization tests as the net.

### What *not* to do in legacy code

- **Don't simplify without tests.** A "harmless cleanup" that flips a subtle behavior is the classic legacy incident.
- **Don't gold-plate the cleanup.** Replacing one over-engineered structure with a *different* one ("now with hexagonal architecture!") is not progress.
- **Don't boil the ocean.** A standalone "simplification initiative" with no feature value rarely survives the first deadline. Tie it to work flowing through the code anyway.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The flexible framework nobody used

A team built an internal "rules engine" — generic, configurable, plugin-based — to handle what was, at launch, *three* hard-coded business rules. Two years later it held about five rules, all written by the same team, none by the "third-party plugin authors" the architecture anticipated. The engine was ~8,000 lines; the rules it ran were ~150. Every new rule required learning the engine's DSL. **Postmortem:** textbook gold-plating — built for imagined extensibility that never arrived. **Fix:** the rules were re-expressed as plain functions (~150 lines total); the engine was deleted; onboarding for "add a rule" dropped from days to minutes. **Lesson:** flexibility you don't use is pure cost. The present requirement was three rules; the design should have been three functions.

### Incident 2: The clever one-liner that hid a bug

A pricing calculation was written as a single dense expression — a nested ternary chained with stream operations across three lines — because it was "elegant." It contained an operator-precedence error that mis-applied a discount to a subset of orders. The bug survived review *because nobody could actually read the line to check it.* **Fix:** the expression was broken into four named intermediate variables with the discount step isolated; the bug became obvious and was fixed, and a regression test was added. **Lesson:** cleverness that defeats review is negative value. KISS optimizes the reader — including the reviewer who must verify correctness.

### Incident 3: The cyclomatic gate that rewarded inscrutable code

A team's only quality gate was cyclomatic complexity. A developer "passed" it by exploding deeply nested logic into a chain of fifteen tiny private methods, each scoring low, none readable as a whole (you had to chase all fifteen to understand one operation). The metric was green; the code was inscrutable. **Fix:** added a cognitive-complexity gate and a review norm against pointless method-shredding. **Lesson:** the wrong metric rewards the wrong behavior. Measure cognitive complexity; the goal is comprehension, not a gamed number.

### Incident 4: KISS weaponized into under-engineering

To "keep it simple," a team inlined persistence calls directly throughout the domain instead of behind a repository seam — a defensible call *if* storage were reversible. It wasn't: a compliance requirement forced a database migration, and storage details were entangled in 200 domain files. **Postmortem:** "keep it simple" was applied to an *irreversible* decision (a one-way door) and to *essential* complexity (the persistence boundary). **Lesson:** KISS targets accidental complexity on reversible decisions. The seam was load-bearing; removing it wasn't simplicity, it was under-engineering. (See [Senior](senior.md) on the two failures.)

---

## The Politics of Simplicity

Sustaining KISS is partly a social problem:

- **Complexity signals effort; simplicity can look like under-delivery.** A 3,000-line "platform" *looks* like more work than a 200-line solution, even when the small version is better. Professionals must educate stakeholders that the small solution is the *harder, better* result.
- **Deleting code feels risky and unrewarded.** Make removals safe (tests) and visible (celebrate them) so engineers aren't punished for the most valuable cleanups.
- **"We might need it" is socially hard to refuse.** Arm the team with YAGNI-as-policy and the reversibility test so refusing speculation cites a *standard*, not a colleague.
- **Senior engineers set the example.** If the staff engineer reaches for the framework and the pattern by reflex, everyone does. Model "simplest thing that works," and *explain why you didn't add the abstraction.*
- **"Simple" gets confused with "familiar."** Watch for teammates defending a complected-but-familiar choice as "simple." Re-anchor on un-entanglement (Hickey), not comfort. (See [Senior](senior.md).)

## Review Checklist

```text
KISS REVIEW CHECKLIST
[ ] PRESENT REQUIREMENT — every new interface/class/param/config/generic
    is forced by a real, current need (not "might need it later" → YAGNI)
[ ] NO ONE-IMPL INTERFACE / no pass-through wrapper / no unused hook
[ ] NO GENERIC ENGINE for 1–2 concrete cases (prefer named functions)
[ ] NO CLEVER ONE-LINER a reviewer can't verify — name it / split it
[ ] NO MODE-FLAG / if(caller==X) braiding — un-complect into clear functions
[ ] NESTING shallow (guard clauses); cognitive complexity within gate
[ ] DRY targets KNOWLEDGE, not coincidence (no manufactured coupling)
[ ] ESSENTIAL ≠ ACCIDENTAL — don't flag load-bearing seams / domain
    complexity as "over-engineering"
[ ] ONE-WAY DOORS (schema/API/protocol/crypto) reviewed deliberately
[ ] DEEP not shallow — new abstractions absorb more than they add
```

## Cheat Sheet

```text
ENFORCE        highest-value question: "what PRESENT requirement
               forces this element?"  (kills most over-engineering)

GOLD-PLATING   capability beyond requirements. Counter: YAGNI-as-policy;
               CELEBRATE deletions, not additions. Simplicity is the win.

MEASURE        cognitive complexity + elements-per-feature + change-coupling.
               NOT cyclomatic-alone, NOT duplication-%-alone.
               Beware method-shredding gaming the metric.

DON'T          weaponize KISS against ESSENTIAL complexity or load-bearing
               seams — that's under-engineering, not simplicity.

LEGACY         characterization tests FIRST → classify essential/accidental
               → simplify the accidental, opportunistically, small commits.
               Strangle; never big-bang rewrite.

WRONG ABSTR.   inline back to callers → simplify each → re-extract only the
               genuinely shared knowledge.
```
