## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**DRY** stands for **Don't Repeat Yourself**. Almost everyone learns it as "don't copy-paste code" — and almost everyone learns it slightly wrong. The principle is sharper and more important than the slogan suggests. It comes from Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas's book *The Pragmatic Programmer*, and the original definition is precise:

> **Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.** — Hunt & Thomas, *The Pragmatic Programmer*

Read that twice. The word that matters is **knowledge** — not *code*, not *text*, not *lines*. DRY is about facts, rules, and decisions, not about characters on the screen. A *piece of knowledge* is something like "the VAT rate is 20%," "an order is overdue after 30 days," "a username must be 3–20 characters," or "we round currency half-up." Each such fact should be written down in **exactly one place** that the rest of the system refers to.

### Why this matters

When a fact lives in one place, changing it is a one-line edit. When the *same* fact is copied into five places, changing it means finding and updating all five — and the day you update four and miss one, you have a bug that is invisible until production. That single missed copy is the disease DRY exists to prevent. The slogan "don't repeat yourself" is really shorthand for **"don't make the same decision in two places, because then you have to remember both of them forever."**

At the junior level your job is to get the definition right (most people don't), learn to spot *real* duplication of knowledge, and learn the standard moves for collapsing it to one authoritative place. The deeper, harder half — *when duplication is actually the right call* — starts at [Middle](middle.md) and is the heart of [Senior](senior.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write functions/methods and extract a block of code into one (extract function).
- **Required:** Comfort with constants, modules/imports, and basic refactoring (rename, extract).
- **Helpful:** A feel for **[KISS](../01-kiss/junior.md)** — keep the simplest thing that works.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to **[Optimize for Deletion](../06-optimize-for-deletion/)** — because the cost of a *bad* DRY decision is code that's hard to delete later.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself — every piece of *knowledge* has one authoritative representation. |
| **Knowledge** | A fact, rule, formula, constant, or decision the system depends on (e.g., "VAT is 20%"). |
| **Single source of truth (SSOT)** | The one authoritative place a piece of knowledge lives; everyone else refers to it. |
| **True duplication** | The *same* knowledge written in more than one place — DRY's actual target. |
| **Coincidental duplication** | Two pieces of code that *look* alike but encode *different* knowledge that may diverge. |
| **Shotgun surgery** | A change that forces edits in many scattered places because knowledge was duplicated. |
| **WET** | "Write Everything Twice" (or "We Enjoy Typing") — the anti-pattern DRY opposes. |
| **Rule of three** | Don't abstract on the 1st or 2nd duplication; wait for the 3rd, when the shape is clear. |

---

## The Real Definition

Let's anchor on the original wording, because the whole topic hinges on it:

> Every piece of **knowledge** must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

Break it into its load-bearing words:

- **Knowledge** — a fact or rule the system relies on. Not "code." Two functions can be byte-for-byte identical and represent two *different* facts.
- **Single** — exactly one, not "few," not "mostly one."
- **Unambiguous** — there's no question about which place is the real one. You never have to wonder "which copy is correct?"
- **Authoritative** — that one place is *the source*. Everything else derives from it or refers to it.
- **Within a system** — DRY is scoped to *a* system. Across separate systems (or separate services), some duplication is normal and even healthy (more on this at [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md)).

So the test for "is this a DRY violation?" is **not** "do these look the same?" It is:

> **Do these two places encode the *same piece of knowledge*? If I change that knowledge, must *both* places change together?**

If yes → it's true duplication → DRY it. If no → it only looks alike → leave it apart.

---

## What DRY Is *Not*

This is the single most-misunderstood point in the principle, so we'll state it plainly and return to it at every level.

> **DRY is not about textual code similarity.** Two pieces of code that look identical but represent *different* knowledge are **not** a DRY violation — and merging them is a mistake, not a fix.

Consider:

```python
def is_valid_username(s):
    return 3 <= len(s) <= 20

def is_valid_room_code(s):
    return 3 <= len(s) <= 20
```

These two functions are *identical*. A naive reading of DRY says "merge them!" But ask the real question: **is this the same knowledge?** No. One encodes "what makes a username valid"; the other encodes "what makes a room code valid." They happen to share the same numbers *today*. Tomorrow, product decides usernames can be up to 30 characters — but room codes stay at 20. If you'd merged them into one `is_valid_length(s)`, you now have to *un-merge* them, and untangling a bad merge is harder than it ever was to keep them apart.

The numbers `3` and `20` are a **coincidence**, not a shared fact. This is **coincidental duplication**, and DRY does *not* apply to it. We'll call this out repeatedly — it's what separates someone who *recites* DRY from someone who *understands* it.

| | True duplication | Coincidental duplication |
|---|---|---|
| What's shared | The *same* knowledge/decision | Only the *appearance* (text, numbers) |
| If the rule changes | **Both** must change together | They change **independently** |
| DRY says | Consolidate to one place | **Leave them apart** |
| Merging anyway gives you | Correct single source of truth | A wrong abstraction + false coupling |

---

## The Cost DRY Fights

Why does duplicated knowledge hurt? Walk through the lifecycle of a copied fact.

Suppose the rule "free shipping over $50" is hard-coded in three places: the checkout page, the order-summary email, and the backend price calculator.

```python
# checkout.py
if cart_total > 50:  free_shipping = True
# email.py
if order.total > 50:  show_free_shipping_badge()
# pricing.py
shipping = 0 if subtotal > 50 else FLAT_RATE
```

Now marketing changes the threshold to **$75**. To implement a one-sentence business decision, an engineer must:

1. *Remember* that the rule lives in three places.
2. *Find* all three (and be sure there isn't a fourth).
3. Update each correctly.

Miss one, and the checkout says "free shipping!" while the calculator still charges for it — a contradiction the customer sees and the company eats. This pattern of "one change, many edits" is called **shotgun surgery**, and the bug it breeds (copies that silently drift apart) is called a **divergent copy**.

The single source of truth eliminates the problem:

```python
# pricing_rules.py  — the ONE authoritative place
FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 75

# everywhere else refers to it
if cart_total > FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD: ...
```

Now the business decision is a **one-line edit**, and it is *impossible* for the three places to disagree, because they all read the same fact. **That** is what DRY buys you: changes to knowledge become local, safe, and atomic.

---

## Knowledge Lives Everywhere, Not Just in Code

The "don't copy-paste code" reading misses half the principle. Knowledge in a software system lives in many artifacts, and DRY spans **all** of them:

| Where knowledge lives | Example of duplicated knowledge | DRY fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | A business rule in three functions | One function / constant |
| **Database schema** | Column list duplicated in code and migrations | Generate model from schema (or vice versa) |
| **Config** | The same timeout in app config and a deploy script | One config value both read |
| **Docs** | An API endpoint documented by hand *and* in code | Generate docs from the code/spec |
| **Build scripts** | A version number in `package.json`, a Dockerfile, and a README | One source the others read |
| **Validation rules** | "Email must be valid" coded in the browser *and* the server | Generate both from one schema |

A particularly common and painful one for juniors: **validation duplicated between client and server.** You write the email/length/required rules in the front-end form *and* re-write them in the back-end API. Now there are two copies of the same knowledge ("what makes this input valid"), and they drift — the front-end accepts something the back-end rejects, and users hit confusing errors. The DRY fix is to define the rules **once** (e.g., a shared schema like JSON Schema, Zod, or a validation spec) and *generate* both sides from it.

> DRY is a principle about **information**, not about a programming language. Wherever the same fact is stated twice, the same risk exists.

---

## A Worked Example

Let's evolve a small piece of code, fixing a *real* DRY violation.

### Start: the same rule, copied

A loyalty program gives members a 10% discount. The rule appears in two places:

```python
# cart.py
def cart_total(items, is_member):
    subtotal = sum(i.price * i.qty for i in items)
    if is_member:
        subtotal = subtotal * 0.9          # 10% member discount
    return subtotal

# receipt.py
def receipt_savings(items, is_member):
    subtotal = sum(i.price * i.qty for i in items)
    if is_member:
        return subtotal * 0.1              # 10% member discount  ← same fact!
    return 0
```

The fact **"members get 10% off"** lives in two files, encoded as `0.9` in one and `0.1` in the other. If the discount changes to 15%, you must edit both — and they're easy to get inconsistent (one says 0.85, the other still says 0.1). This is **true duplication**: the *same knowledge*, and a change to it *forces* a change in both.

### Fix: one authoritative place

```python
# loyalty.py  — the single source of truth for the discount rule
MEMBER_DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.10

def member_discount(subtotal, is_member):
    return subtotal * MEMBER_DISCOUNT_RATE if is_member else 0.0
```

```python
# cart.py
def cart_total(items, is_member):
    subtotal = sum(i.price * i.qty for i in items)
    return subtotal - member_discount(subtotal, is_member)

# receipt.py
def receipt_savings(items, is_member):
    subtotal = sum(i.price * i.qty for i in items)
    return member_discount(subtotal, is_member)
```

Now "members get 10% off" lives in **one** place. Change the rate once and *both* the cart and the receipt update — and they can never disagree. That's the win.

### What we did *not* do

We did **not** also merge `cart_total` and `receipt_savings` into one "generic calculation" function just because they share a few lines. They answer *different questions* (a total vs. a savings amount). Only the **discount knowledge** was duplicated, so only *that* got a single home. **DRY out the knowledge; leave the rest alone.**

---

## Techniques to Remove True Duplication

When you've confirmed it's genuinely the *same knowledge*, here are the standard moves, from smallest to largest:

1. **Extract a constant.** A magic number/string repeated everywhere → one named constant. (`FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD = 75`.)
2. **Extract a function/method.** A repeated formula or rule → one function callers invoke. (`member_discount(...)`.)
3. **Parameterize.** Several near-copies that differ only in a value → one function with a parameter for that value.
4. **Extract a module/class.** A cluster of related rules → one module that owns that knowledge.
5. **Single source of truth across layers.** Define a fact once (a schema, a config, a spec) and **generate** the other representations from it (client+server validation, docs, types).
6. **Code generation.** When the same structure must appear in several forms (types, serializers, API clients), generate them all from one definition rather than hand-writing each.

The thread running through all of these: **find the one true home for the knowledge, and make everything else point at it.**

## WET, DIE, and the Counter-Acronyms

DRY spawned a small family of acronyms worth knowing:

| Acronym | Expands to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself | One authoritative representation per piece of knowledge. |
| **WET** | "Write Everything Twice" / "We Enjoy Typing" | The anti-pattern: the same knowledge copied repeatedly. |
| **DIE** | "Duplication Is Evil" | A blunt restatement of DRY's motivation. |
| **AHA** | "Avoid Hasty Abstractions" | The *counter*-acronym — don't DRY too eagerly; the wrong abstraction is worse than duplication. (See [Middle](middle.md).) |

Most teams say "this code is too WET" to mean "this knowledge is copied all over." But notice the tension between **DIE** ("duplication is evil") and **AHA** ("avoid hasty abstractions"). The resolution — *which* duplication is evil and *which* should be tolerated — is the real skill, and it's where this topic gets interesting. The short version, expanded at [Middle](middle.md): **duplication of knowledge is evil; coincidental duplication is fine, and removing it hastily creates a worse problem.**

---

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **Single source of truth** | A master copy of a contract in a vault; everyone works from photocopies that all point back to it. Amend the master and every copy is "updated" because it was never authoritative. |
| **Duplicated knowledge** | Five sticky notes around the office with the Wi-Fi password. Change the password and you must find every note — miss one and someone's locked out. |
| **Coincidental duplication** | Two unrelated people who happen to share a birthday. Treating them as "the same person because they match" is obviously wrong — the match is a coincidence, not an identity. |
| **Shotgun surgery** | Fixing a typo in a book by editing every printed copy individually instead of the manuscript. |

---

## Mental Models

**The intuition:** *"Each fact gets one home. Everyone else visits; nobody keeps a private copy."*

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
        │  ONE authoritative representation │   ← the source of truth
        │  e.g. FREE_SHIPPING_THRESHOLD=75  │
        └──────────────┬───────────────────┘
                       │ referred to by
        ┌──────────────┼───────────────┐
        ▼              ▼               ▼
   checkout page   summary email   price calc
   (no copy)       (no copy)       (no copy)
```

A second model — the **change test**. Before you "DRY" two things, ask: *"If the rule behind one changes, does the other have to change in exactly the same way?"*

```
  Same knowledge?  ──yes──►  ONE home (apply DRY)
        │
        └──no (coincidence)──►  Keep them apart (DRY does NOT apply)
```

DRY is fundamentally about making **change** cheap and safe. You're not chasing tidiness; you're making sure that when a fact moves, it moves everywhere at once.

---

## Best Practices

1. **DRY the knowledge, not the text.** Before merging, confirm the two places encode the *same fact*, not just the same characters.
2. **Run the change test.** "If this rule changes, must both change together?" Yes → consolidate. No → leave apart.
3. **Give each fact one named home.** Constants, a rules module, a config value, a schema — make the source of truth obvious and authoritative.
4. **Hunt duplication across *all* artifacts**, not just `.py`/`.java` files: config, schema, docs, build scripts, client+server validation.
5. **Prefer the smallest fix** that gives a single source of truth: a constant before a function, a function before a class, a class before a code-gen pipeline.
6. **Don't abstract on the first or second copy** — wait for the [rule of three](#wet-die-and-the-counter-acronyms) when you're unsure the knowledge is truly shared.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **"DRY = don't copy-paste."** The slogan, not the principle. DRY is about *knowledge*, and plenty of look-alike code is *not* duplicated knowledge.
2. **Merging coincidental duplication.** Two functions that look alike but encode different rules get merged "to be DRY," then have to be painfully un-merged when one rule changes. This creates a **wrong abstraction** (the central danger — see [Senior](senior.md)).
3. **Only checking code.** Forgetting that the same rule is *also* duplicated in the database schema, the docs, or the client-side validation.
4. **Abstracting too early.** Extracting a shared helper after seeing two similar lines, before you know whether they're truly the same knowledge — see the [rule of three](#wet-die-and-the-counter-acronyms).
5. **Over-DRYing constants.** Forcing two unrelated `0.20`s to share one constant `RATE` just because the number matches — now an invoice change accidentally alters payroll.
6. **Treating DRY as absolute.** It conflicts with other principles (decoupling, locality, deletability). It's a heuristic, not a law — covered at [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md).

---

## Tricky Points

- **"Repeat yourself" means "repeat the *knowledge*," not "repeat the keystrokes."** Identical code is a *hint* to investigate, never proof of a violation.
- **Removing duplication can *increase* coupling.** A shared helper ties its callers together. If they should evolve independently, that shared helper is a defect, not a DRY win. (Deep dive: [Senior](senior.md) and [Connascence](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/03-connascence/).)
- **The wrong abstraction is harder to remove than duplication.** Once five callers depend on a too-eager shared abstraction, unwinding it is risky. Duplication, by contrast, is local and easy to consolidate *later*. This asymmetry is why "wait" is often the right move. (See [Optimize for Deletion](../06-optimize-for-deletion/).)
- **DRY is scoped "within a system."** Across service or bounded-context boundaries, a little duplication is often healthier than a shared dependency — "a little copying is better than a little dependency." (See [Senior](senior.md).)

---

## Test Yourself

1. State the *real* definition of DRY (Hunt & Thomas). Which single word matters most, and why?
2. Two functions are byte-for-byte identical. Is that automatically a DRY violation? What question decides it?
3. What is "shotgun surgery," and how does a single source of truth prevent it?
4. Name three *non-code* artifacts where duplicated knowledge causes bugs.
5. What does WET stand for, and what does AHA warn against?
6. Why can merging coincidental duplication be *worse* than leaving it?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THE REAL DEFINITION (Hunt & Thomas)
  "Every piece of KNOWLEDGE must have a single, unambiguous,
   authoritative representation within a system."
  → DRY is about KNOWLEDGE, not about look-alike code.

THE TEST before you DRY two things
  "If the rule behind one changes, must the other change the SAME way?"
    yes → true duplication      → ONE source of truth (apply DRY)
    no  → coincidental match     → KEEP THEM APART (DRY does not apply)

WHAT DRY FIGHTS
  copied knowledge → shotgun surgery → miss a copy → divergent-copy bug

WHERE KNOWLEDGE LIVES (DRY spans all of these)
  code · schema · config · docs · build scripts · client+server validation

TECHNIQUES (smallest first)
  constant → function → parameterize → module → single-source-+-generate

ACRONYMS
  WET  Write Everything Twice (the anti-pattern)
  DIE  Duplication Is Evil
  AHA  Avoid Hasty Abstractions (the brake — don't DRY too soon)
```

---

## Summary

- **DRY's real definition:** *every piece of **knowledge** must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.* The key word is **knowledge** — not code, not text.
- The defining test: *if the rule behind one place changes, must the other change the same way?* Yes → true duplication, apply DRY. No → coincidence, **leave it apart**.
- DRY fights **shotgun surgery** and **divergent copies**: copied knowledge means every change must find all copies, and a missed one is a silent bug.
- Knowledge lives in **code, schemas, config, docs, build scripts, and validation** — DRY spans all of them (classic case: client + server validation from one source).
- **Coincidental duplication is not a DRY violation**; merging it creates the **wrong abstraction**, the central danger explored at [Senior](senior.md).
- Remember the family: **WET** (the anti-pattern), **DIE** (the motivation), **AHA** (the brake).
