## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — getting the axes of variation right across a large, multi-contributor codebase over years.

The principle is simple to state and brutal to sustain at scale. Two opposite failures accumulate in any long-lived codebase, often *in the same system*:

- **Speculative seams** pile up: interfaces with one implementation, plugin systems with no plugins, configuration nobody configures — each added by a well-meaning engineer "future-proofing."
- **Real axes stay exposed**: the payment-type `switch`, the format-handling `if`-ladder, the vendor SDK calls smeared through the domain — each left concrete because nobody noticed the volatility until the third painful change.

The professional question is operational: **how do you get a team to encapsulate the axes that genuinely vary, and *only* those, when changes land daily from dozens of people with different instincts?** The answer is a system — review standards that demand evidence for every seam, volatility metrics that point at the real axes, conventions that make the right call the default, and a disciplined way to add seams to legacy code without breaking it.

## Enforcing the Principle in Code Review

Both failure modes enter one PR at a time, so review is where they're caught. The reviewer's job is *symmetric*: challenge speculative seams **and** flag exposed axes.

### Catching the speculative seam

The single highest-value review question for any new abstraction:

> **"What present requirement — two real cases, a scheduled feature, or an irreversible boundary — forces this seam?"**

If the honest answer is "it's more flexible / future-proof / extensible," the seam is a YAGNI violation and should come out (add it the day the second case is real). Make this a routine, non-confrontational bar, not an accusation.

```text
> "This PaymentMethod interface has one implementation (Stripe) and one
>  caller. What's the second provider we're anticipating, and is it scheduled?
>  If it's hypothetical, let's use the concrete StripeGateway and extract the
>  interface when the second provider is real — the second case will tell us
>  the right shape."
```

### Catching the exposed axis

The mirror question, asked of any new or edited `switch`/`if`-ladder over a type discriminator:

> **"Is this the *third* place we branch on this same discriminator? If so, it's a real axis of variation that's leaked everywhere — let's encapsulate it."**

```text
> "This is the third place we switch on `order.payment_type` (also in
>  refund.py and report.py). That's a real axis — adding a method now means
>  editing three files and risking a miss. Let's pull it behind a
>  PaymentMethod interface so a new method is one new class."
```

### The leaky-interface check (the senior smell)

When a seam *does* exist, verify it doesn't leak each implementation's specifics across the boundary:

```text
> "charge(amount, cvv=None, mandate_id=None, redirect_url=None) leaks every
>  provider's specifics onto the shared interface — that's connascence of
>  meaning crossing the boundary, so it won't actually contain change. Either
>  the axis was guessed wrong, or these should be separate handlers."
```

These three questions — *what forces this seam? / is this the third branch? / does the interface leak?* — catch the great majority of both over- and under-encapsulation.

## Measuring Volatility to Locate the Real Axes

Intuition about "what changes" is unreliable; **git history is the ground truth.** The professional move is to *measure* volatility and point seams at the measured axes, not the imagined ones.

### Change frequency: where the churn is

```bash
# The files that change most often = your empirical volatility map.
git log --since="12 months ago" --name-only --pretty=format: \
  | grep -v '^$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -25
```

A high-churn file dense with branching logic is an un-encapsulated axis. A high-churn file that's *already* a clean implementation behind a stable interface is fine — that's the volatility landing exactly where you put it.

### Change coupling: which files change *together*

The sharper signal. If `checkout.py`, `refund.py`, and `report.py` keep appearing in the *same commits*, they share an un-encapsulated axis — a change to one forces changes to the others (distributed connascence). That co-change pattern is the fingerprint of a missing seam:

```bash
# Pairs of files frequently changed together → candidates for a shared seam.
# (Conceptually: for each commit, emit all file pairs; count pair frequency.)
```

| Metric | What it tells you | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Change frequency** (per file) | Where volatility concentrates | Encapsulate high-churn files dense with branching |
| **Change coupling** (co-change of files) | Which files share a hidden axis | Extract the shared axis behind one seam |
| **Element-count per feature** (trend) | Whether speculative seams are accruing | Rising → audit for one-impl interfaces |
| **Count of one-implementation interfaces** | Speculative-generality load | High → inline the dead seams |

> The honest-measurement rule: **change coupling identifies *under*-encapsulation (exposed axes); one-implementation-interface count identifies *over*-encapsulation (speculative seams).** Track both — a codebase usually suffers from each in different places. Don't report only one and declare victory.

## Team Conventions

Codify these so the right call is the default path, not a per-PR debate:

1. **Evidence before a seam.** No new interface/Strategy/plugin without a present requirement: two real cases, a scheduled feature, or an irreversible boundary. Written in the engineering handbook so reviewers cite policy, not opinion.
2. **Rule of Three for reversible axes.** Tolerate the duplication/branching twice; encapsulate on the third occurrence (unless variation is certain or the door is one-way).
3. **One-way doors get a seam from day one.** Persistence, third-party vendors, public API contracts, wire protocols — encapsulate behind a port immediately; these are exempt from the Rule of Three because reversibility, not evidence, governs.
4. **No one-implementation interfaces in new code** — except documented test seams. (A genuine need for a test double *is* a present requirement.)
5. **Type-discriminator `switch` over two-plus places ⇒ polymorphism.** A repeated discriminator branch is a flagged smell.
6. **Interfaces carry only the shared contract.** Reject parameters/methods that serve one implementation; they signal a wrong or leaky axis.
7. **Periodic volatility review.** Quarterly, re-run change-coupling/churn analysis; inline seams whose axis has frozen; add seams to newly-hot files.

These conventions encode the senior reasoning so that juniors get it right by default and reviewers enforce a standard rather than a preference.

## Introducing Seams into Legacy Systems

The greenfield case is easy. The real work is **carving an axis of variation out of code where it's currently smeared everywhere, untested, and in production.** The approach is incremental and test-guarded — never a rewrite.

### The sequence (Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*)

1. **Characterize first.** Write tests that pin the *current* behavior of every site that touches the axis (e.g., every payment branch in checkout, refund, report) — including its quirks. You cannot safely move logic behind a seam without a net.
2. **Identify the true axis from churn.** Use change-coupling to confirm *which* files actually co-change on this concept — don't guess the seam location; measure it.
3. **Extract the interface from the existing cases.** With two or three concrete cases already in the code, you have the data the Rule of Three asks for — the interface shape is *observed*, not guessed. Define it to capture only the shared contract.
4. **Move one case behind the seam at a time**, keeping tests green, in small commits. Replace each scattered branch with a call to the interface.
5. **Collapse the discriminator.** Once every case is behind the seam, the repeated `switch`/`if`-ladders disappear; new cases become one new class.

### Removing a *wrong*, load-bearing seam (the harder legacy job)

Legacy systems are full of speculative interfaces that became load-bearing. The safe removal mirrors the senior-level "escape the wrong abstraction":

```text
1. Characterize: tests around every caller of the over-general/leaky seam.
2. Inline: push the interface's behavior back into each caller
   (temporarily MORE duplication — that's correct; the wrong seam was worse).
3. Simplify each caller independently — delete the flags/params it never used.
4. Re-extract ONLY the genuinely shared contract, if any axis is truly real.
5. Delete the old interface.
```

The intermediate state has *more* duplication on purpose — the wrong abstraction was worse than the duplication it replaced.

### What *not* to do

- **Don't add a seam without characterization tests.** A "harmless" extraction that subtly changes behavior is the classic legacy incident.
- **Don't replace a wrong seam with a different speculative one** ("now with hexagonal ports everywhere!"). Aim for the *real* axes, not a new favorite pattern.
- **Don't run a standalone "introduce seams" project.** Do it opportunistically (Boy Scout Rule) as feature work flows through the volatile files.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The plugin system with no plugins

A team built a generic, configurable "integration framework" to hold what was, at launch, *two* hard-coded partner integrations — anticipating that partners would write their own plugins against the published SPI. Three years later it held four integrations, **all written by the same team**, none by an external party. The framework was ~12,000 lines; the integrations it ran were ~600. Every new integration required learning the framework's lifecycle and DSL. **Postmortem:** the axis ("third-party-authored integrations") was *imagined*, never demonstrated — speculative generality at framework scale. **Fix:** integrations re-expressed as plain adapter classes (~600 lines total) behind a thin interface; the framework deleted. "Add an integration" dropped from a week to an afternoon. **Lesson:** encapsulating an axis nobody actually varies along is pure cost. The present requirement was two integrations — the design should have been two adapters.

### Incident 2: The exposed axis that caused a production miss

A payments service branched on `payment_type` in *seven* places (checkout, refund, partial-refund, receipt, reconciliation, fraud-check, reporting). Adding "BNPL" required editing all seven; the engineer found six and missed the fraud-check path. BNPL transactions skipped fraud screening for **eleven days** before detection. **Postmortem:** a real, high-churn axis left un-encapsulated — classic shotgun surgery, with a missed site causing a security gap. **Fix:** the seven branches were collapsed behind a `PaymentMethod` interface (characterization tests first); adding the *next* method became one class touched in one place. **Lesson:** the cost of an exposed real axis isn't just toil — it's the *missed* edit. Change-coupling analysis had flagged these seven files as a co-change cluster months earlier; the signal was ignored.

### Incident 3: The leaky seam that contained nothing

A team *did* encapsulate notifications behind a `Notifier` interface — but the interface was `send(user, channel, subject, body, sms_template_id, push_payload, email_attachments)`. Every caller passed a soup of mostly-null arguments; every implementation ignored most of them. Adding a "webhook" channel meant *editing the interface* (and therefore every caller and implementation). **Postmortem:** the seam existed but leaked each channel's specifics across the boundary (connascence of meaning crossing the wall) — so it failed to contain change, the one thing it was for. **Fix:** narrowed the interface to `send(recipient, Message)` with channel-specific construction behind each implementation. **Lesson:** an interface that leaks implementation specifics is not encapsulation — it's a tollbooth that still requires editing the road. The test of a seam is whether a new case can be added *without touching the interface*.

### Incident 4: Under-engineering at a one-way door

To "keep it simple," a team made direct calls to a third-party email vendor's SDK throughout the codebase rather than behind an adapter — a defensible YAGNI call *if* the vendor were reversible. It wasn't: the vendor had an outage and a pricing change, and switching meant editing **140 files** with the SDK's types entangled in business logic. **Lesson:** YAGNI applies to *reversible* decisions. A third-party vendor boundary is a one-way door; "encapsulate what changes" *outranks* YAGNI there because the change (swapping vendors) is both foreseeable and catastrophic to retrofit.

## The Politics of Seams

Sustaining the principle is partly social:

- **Speculative seams *look* like senior work.** A "pluggable framework" signals sophistication; deleting it to a concrete class looks like under-delivery. Reframe relentlessly: **removing an unused seam is the senior move**, and *adding* one without evidence is the junior reflex.
- **Exposed axes are invisible until they bite.** Nobody gets credit for "I noticed payment_type was branched in seven places and encapsulated it before the next provider." Make change-coupling reports visible so the *prevention* is rewarded, not just the incident response.
- **"We might need it" is socially hard to refuse.** Arm the team with the evidence-before-a-seam policy and the reversibility test, so refusing speculation cites a standard rather than blocking a colleague.
- **Seniors set the reflex.** If the staff engineer reaches for an interface-per-noun by default, everyone does. Model "concrete until the second case — except at one-way doors," and *explain the axis* you did or didn't encapsulate.

## Review Checklist

```text
ENCAPSULATE-WHAT-CHANGES REVIEW CHECKLIST
[ ] NEW SEAM — has a PRESENT requirement (2 real cases / scheduled / one-way door)?
[ ] NEW SEAM — not a one-implementation interface (except documented test seam)?
[ ] INTERFACE — carries ONLY the shared contract (no per-impl params/methods)?
[ ] INTERFACE — can a new case be added WITHOUT editing the interface? (the real test)
[ ] EXPOSED AXIS — is this the 3rd+ place we branch on the same discriminator?
[ ] EXPOSED AXIS — does change-coupling show these files co-changing? → encapsulate
[ ] ONE-WAY DOOR — storage/vendor/public API/protocol encapsulated up front?
[ ] WRONG AXIS — does the seam contain the change, or leak specifics across it?
[ ] EVIDENCE — encapsulating what DEMONSTRABLY varies, not what we IMAGINE might?
```

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THE TWO QUESTIONS (ask both, symmetrically)
  speculative seam? → "what PRESENT requirement forces this?"
  exposed axis?     → "is this the 3rd branch on the same discriminator?"

MEASURE, DON'T GUESS
  change frequency  → where volatility concentrates (encapsulate hot+branchy)
  change coupling   → files that co-change share a HIDDEN axis (extract the seam)
  one-impl-iface ct → speculative-generality load (inline dead seams)

THE SEAM TEST
  a real seam: new case = new class, interface UNTOUCHED.
  a leaky seam: new case = edit the interface → wrong/leaky axis.

ONE-WAY DOORS  storage / vendor / public API / protocol → seam UP FRONT
               (reversibility governs, beats the Rule of Three & YAGNI)

LEGACY         characterize FIRST → confirm axis via churn → extract interface
               from existing cases → move one case at a time → collapse the switch.
               Wrong seam? inline back → simplify → re-extract real contract.

CULTURE        removing an unused seam = senior move. Reward PREVENTION
               (encapsulating an exposed axis before it bites), not just heroics.
```
