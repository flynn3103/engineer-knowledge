## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Command Query Separation (CQS)** is a rule about how you design the methods on an object. It was named by **Bertrand Meyer** in *Object-Oriented Software Construction* (the book where the Eiffel language and "Design by Contract" come from). The rule is short enough to memorize:

> **Every method should be either a *command* that performs an action — and changes state — or a *query* that returns data — and causes no observable side effects. A method should never be both.**

Meyer summarized the spirit of it in a sentence worth carving above your desk:

> **"Asking a question should not change the answer."**

That's the whole idea. A **query** is a method you call to *find something out*: `account.balance()`, `list.size()`, `user.isActive()`. It hands you a value and leaves the world exactly as it found it. A **command** is a method you call to *make something happen*: `account.deposit(100)`, `list.clear()`, `user.deactivate()`. It changes the state of the object and, by convention, returns nothing.

The trouble starts when a single method tries to do both at once — change state *and* report a value. That method is harder to reason about, harder to test, and full of nasty surprises, because every time you *ask* it something you also *change* something.

### Why this matters

If you keep commands and queries separate, you gain a superpower: **you can call any query as many times as you like, in any order, anywhere — in a log line, a debugger watch, an assertion, a loop condition — and know for certain you haven't changed anything.** You stop fearing your own getters. Code becomes predictable, and predictable code is code you can reason about.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Comfort with methods/functions, objects, and the difference between *returning a value* and *mutating state*.
- **Required:** A basic feel for **side effects** — anything a method does besides return a value (writing a field, printing, sending a network call, updating a database).
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with **[encapsulation](../01-encapsulate-what-changes/junior.md)** — CQS is a sibling principle about what a method's *contract* should be.
- **Helpful:** Having written a unit test, so you appreciate why a side-effect-free query is easy to test.

---

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Command** | A method that performs an action and changes observable state. Conventionally returns `void`/nothing. |
| **Query** | A method that returns data and causes **no observable side effects** — it only reads. |
| **Side effect** | Anything a method does besides compute and return its value: mutating a field, writing to a DB, printing, sending a message. |
| **Observable side effect** | A side effect a caller can detect — a changed result on the next call, a new row in a table, a sent email. (Caching *behind the scenes* is **not** observable.) |
| **Idempotent (in effect)** | Calling it again produces no *additional* observable change. A pure query is trivially this way. |
| **Referential transparency** | A call can be replaced by its result value without changing program behavior — true of side-effect-free queries. |
| **Mutator** | Another word for a command — it mutates state. |
| **Accessor / getter** | Another word for a query — it accesses (reads) state. |

---

## The Principle in One Sentence

> **A method does something, or it answers something — never both.**

Put differently: after you call a method, you should be able to say *either* "the world changed and I got nothing back" (command) *or* "I got an answer and the world is unchanged" (query). If you can't cleanly say one or the other, the method is violating CQS.

---

## Commands vs. Queries

| Aspect | **Command** | **Query** |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | *Do* something | *Answer* something |
| Changes state? | **Yes** (that's the point) | **No** |
| Returns a value? | No (conventionally `void`) | **Yes** (that's the point) |
| Safe to call repeatedly? | No — each call may change things | **Yes** — no observable effect |
| Safe to skip? | No — skipping changes behavior | **Yes** — removing it changes nothing observable |
| Examples | `deposit()`, `save()`, `clear()`, `deactivate()` | `balance()`, `size()`, `isActive()`, `findById()` |
| Verb feel | An imperative: "Do this!" | A question: "What is…?" |

A quick test by name: if the method name is an **imperative verb** (`add`, `remove`, `update`, `send`), it's probably a command and should return nothing. If it's a **question or a noun** (`isReady`, `count`, `total`, `getName`), it's a query and must not change anything.

---

## Why It Matters: Asking a Question Shouldn't Change the Answer

Imagine a getter that secretly mutates. You write a debug log:

```python
logger.debug(f"current value is {counter.value()}")
```

If `value()` is a clean **query**, this log is harmless — you can add it, remove it, or call it ten times, and the program behaves identically. But if `value()` *also increments the counter*, then merely *logging* the value changes the program. Now:

- **Debugging changes behavior.** Adding a log line makes the bug move or vanish. ("It only fails when I'm *not* watching it.")
- **Asserts change behavior.** `assert counter.value() == 5` in a test silently bumps the counter, so the next assertion is wrong — and removing the assert "fixes" it.
- **You can't reorder or repeat freely.** `a = q(); b = q();` may give `a != b` for reasons that have nothing to do with the data you care about.
- **Caching breaks.** You'd love to remember the answer to avoid recomputing — but you can't, because each call has a different effect.

Clean queries give you **four freedoms** beginners learn to love:

1. **Repeat** them safely (call as often as you want).
2. **Reorder** them (the order of two queries doesn't matter).
3. **Cache / memoize** them (remember the answer).
4. **Remove** them when unused (deleting a query call changes nothing observable).

Commands give you none of those freedoms — and *that's fine*, because a command's job is precisely to change the world. The principle just says: **keep the two jobs in separate methods so you always know which freedoms you have.**

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **Query** | Checking a clock. You read the time; the clock keeps ticking on its own, but your *looking* didn't change it. You can look as often as you like. |
| **Command** | Setting the clock. You change the time. Calling it twice sets it twice. |
| **A method that does both** | A thermometer that *raises* the temperature a little every time you read it. Now you can't measure the room without disturbing it — and you can never trust the number. |
| **"Asking shouldn't change the answer"** | A scale at the doctor's office. Stepping on it to *read* your weight shouldn't *add* a kilogram each time. |
| **The four freedoms of queries** | A reference book: you can re-read a page, read pages out of order, photocopy it, or never open it — none of that edits the book. |

---

## Mental Models

**The intuition:** *"A method is either a hand that moves something, or an eye that looks at something — not a hand pretending to be an eye."*

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
        │  COMMAND                                   │
        │  ───────                                   │
        │  changes state · returns nothing           │
        │  "Do it."     (deposit, save, clear)       │
        ├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
        │  QUERY                                     │
        │  ─────                                      │
        │  returns data · changes nothing            │
        │  "What is it?"  (balance, size, isActive)  │
        └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
   A method lives in ONE box. Never straddling both.
```

A second model: think of the **light switch vs. the window**. A switch is a command — flip it and the room changes. A window is a query — look through it as often as you like; looking doesn't change the weather. CQS says: don't build a "window that changes the weather when you look."

---

## A Worked Example: Splitting a Method That Does Both

A shopping cart with a method that **both** removes the next item **and** returns it — a classic CQS violation.

### Start: one method doing two jobs

```python
class Cart:
    def __init__(self):
        self._items = []

    def add(self, item):
        self._items.append(item)

    def take_next(self):          # ❌ COMMAND + QUERY in one method
        item = self._items.pop(0) # mutates: removes the item
        return item               # AND returns it
```

`take_next()` mutates the cart *and* returns a value. Watch the trouble it causes:

```python
# You want to peek at what's next — but you can't, without removing it:
print(f"Next up: {cart.take_next()}")   # oops, you just removed it from the cart!
```

Logging "what's next" *deleted* the item. Asking the question changed the answer.

### The CQS split: a query to look, a command to act

```python
class Cart:
    def __init__(self):
        self._items = []

    def add(self, item):          # COMMAND: changes state, returns nothing
        self._items.append(item)

    def next_item(self):          # QUERY: returns data, changes nothing
        return self._items[0]

    def remove_next(self):        # COMMAND: changes state, returns nothing
        del self._items[0]
```

Now the two jobs are separate, and the caller decides:

```python
print(f"Next up: {cart.next_item()}")   # safe — only looks
# ...later, when you actually want to consume it:
item = cart.next_item()
cart.remove_next()
```

You can now *peek* without consuming, log freely, and the cart only changes when you explicitly tell it to with a command. That clarity is the entire payoff of CQS.

> Note: there's a famous, *deliberate* exception — `Stack.pop()` returns **and** removes on purpose, for good reasons covered [below](#the-famous-accepted-exception-pop). CQS is a strong default with conscious exceptions, not an absolute law.

## Code Examples

### Java — a "getter" that secretly mutates (violation → fix)

```java
// ❌ VIOLATION: looks like a query, but lazily mutates on read
class Session {
    private Instant lastAccess;
    public Instant getLastAccess() {
        this.lastAccess = Instant.now();   // side effect hidden in a getter!
        return this.lastAccess;
    }
}
// Calling getLastAccess() to LOG it changes the session's state.
```

```java
// ✅ FIX: a pure query to read, a separate command to update
class Session {
    private Instant lastAccess;
    public Instant lastAccess() {       // QUERY: no side effects
        return this.lastAccess;
    }
    public void touch() {               // COMMAND: updates, returns void
        this.lastAccess = Instant.now();
    }
}
```

### Python — `get_and_increment` split into a query and a command

```python
# ❌ VIOLATION: returns the value AND changes it
class Counter:
    def __init__(self): self._n = 0
    def get_and_increment(self):
        n = self._n
        self._n += 1
        return n            # query + command in one

# ✅ FIX
class Counter:
    def __init__(self): self._n = 0
    def value(self):        # QUERY
        return self._n
    def increment(self):    # COMMAND (returns nothing)
        self._n += 1
```

### TypeScript — command returns nothing; query returns data

```typescript
class TodoList {
  private items: string[] = [];

  add(item: string): void {        // COMMAND: void return is the signal
    this.items.push(item);
  }

  count(): number {                // QUERY: returns data, mutates nothing
    return this.items.length;
  }

  // ❌ would violate CQS:
  // addAndCount(item: string): number { this.items.push(item); return this.items.length; }
}
```

Notice how the **return type tells the story**: a command returns `void`, a query returns data. When you see a non-`void` method that *also* mutates, your CQS alarm should go off.

---

## Spotting Violations

You can often catch a CQS violation just by reading a method's signature and name:

| Smell | Why it's a violation |
|---|---|
| A method named `getX()` that writes a field, logs, or calls the network | A query with hidden side effects — asking changes the answer. |
| `getAndIncrement()`, `popAndReturn()`, `fetchAndDelete()` | The name literally says "do two things." |
| `iterator.next()` | Returns the next element *and* advances the cursor (state change) — a built-in violation. |
| A command (`save()`, `add()`) that returns the thing it just changed *because* you might want it | Mixing — though returning a *status/id* is a softer, debated case (see [Middle](middle.md)). |
| An HTTP `GET` endpoint that records, charges, or mutates data | Breaks CQS at the API level — and breaks REST/caching too (see [Middle](middle.md)). |

**Rule of thumb for a beginner:** if a method returns a value, ask *"does calling this twice in a row change anything?"* If yes, you've probably got a hidden command inside a query.

---

## The Famous Accepted Exception: `pop()`

The single most important nuance to learn early: **CQS is a guideline, not an iron law, and the canonical accepted violation is `Stack.pop()`.**

```python
item = stack.pop()   # removes the top element (COMMAND) AND returns it (QUERY)
```

`pop()` both mutates the stack *and* returns the removed element — a textbook CQS violation. Yet every standard library has it, and nobody objects. Why?

- **It's atomic and safe.** "Remove the top and tell me what it was" is a single, indivisible operation. Splitting it into `top()` (query) then `remove_top()` (command) opens a gap: in a multi-threaded program, another thread could change the stack *between* the two calls, so the value you read isn't the one you removed.
- **The combined version is clearer for this idiom.** Consuming a stack/queue element is naturally one step, and `pop()` reads better than two calls.

Meyer himself acknowledged such pragmatic exceptions. The lesson for you now is **the shape of the rule**: follow CQS by default; break it only *consciously*, when combining the two is genuinely safer or clearer (usually for atomicity). We'll make this precise — `pop`, `compareAndSet`, `queue.poll` — at the [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md) levels.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Let the return type signal intent.** Commands return `void`/nothing; queries return data. When a method does both, that's your cue to split it.
2. **Name by job.** Imperative verbs for commands (`add`, `save`, `clear`); questions or nouns for queries (`isReady`, `count`, `balance`).
3. **Keep queries pure.** No DB writes, no logging that matters, no field mutation, no network calls with effects — a query just reads.
4. **Split "do-and-tell" methods** like `getAndX`, `popAndReturn` into a query and a command — *unless* you have a deliberate atomicity reason (then document it).
5. **Treat a getter that mutates as a bug**, even if "it works." It will surprise the next person who logs it.
6. **Call queries freely** in logs, asserts, and debuggers — that's exactly the freedom CQS buys you. If you *can't*, find out why.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Thinking CQS forbids all side effects.** It doesn't — *commands exist to have side effects.* CQS only says don't put them in the *same* method as a return value.
2. **Hiding a mutation in a getter** ("lazy init that also logs," "getNext that advances"). The classic trap.
3. **Treating CQS as an absolute law.** `pop()` and friends are accepted exceptions for atomicity. The skill is knowing *when* to break it (see [Middle](middle.md)).
4. **Confusing CQS with CQRS.** They sound alike and are related, but CQS is a *method-level* rule on one object; **CQRS** is a *system architecture* pattern. Don't mix them up (full distinction at [Middle](middle.md)).
5. **Returning data from a command "just in case."** If nobody needs it, a command should return nothing — adding a return value invites it to become a query-in-disguise.

---

## Tricky Points

- **"No side effects" really means "no *observable* side effects."** A query may cache its result internally (memoization) or update a hit counter for metrics — that's fine, because the *caller can't observe a difference*. Asking the question still gives the same answer. (More at [Middle](middle.md).)
- **A command *can* throw an exception.** Failing isn't "returning data"; CQS is about the normal-path contract.
- **Returning `this` from a builder is not a violation in spirit.** `builder.add(x).add(y)` returns `this` for chaining, but it isn't answering a *question about domain state* — it's the same object back. (Discussed at [Middle](middle.md).)
- **`pop()` is a violation that everyone accepts.** Memorize it as *the* example of a conscious, justified exception — atomicity beats the rule here.

---

## Test Yourself

1. State Command Query Separation in one sentence, and give Meyer's one-line summary of its spirit.
2. What does a command return? What does a query return? Why?
3. Name the four "freedoms" you get from a pure query.
4. Why is a getter that secretly mutates so dangerous for debugging and testing?
5. Why is `Stack.pop()` an *accepted* violation of CQS?
6. Is `iterator.next()` a command, a query, or both? Explain.

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
COMMAND QUERY SEPARATION (Bertrand Meyer)
  "Asking a question should not change the answer."

  COMMAND   does something    changes state    returns NOTHING (void)
  QUERY     answers something changes NOTHING   returns DATA

  A method lives in exactly ONE box — never both.

QUERIES GIVE YOU FOUR FREEDOMS
  repeat · reorder · cache/memoize · remove   (commands give none — that's fine)

SPOT A VIOLATION
  return type is non-void AND the method mutates?  → probably a split is needed
  getAndIncrement / popAndReturn / a getter that writes/logs/calls network

ACCEPTED EXCEPTION (memorize)
  Stack.pop() returns AND removes — atomicity makes the combined op safer.
  Break CQS only CONSCIOUSLY (usually for thread-safe atomic operations).

DON'T CONFUSE
  CQS  = method-level rule on ONE object       (this topic)
  CQRS = system architecture (separate read/write models)  (different scope)
```

---

## Summary

- **CQS** (Bertrand Meyer): every method is either a **command** (does something, changes state, returns nothing) or a **query** (answers something, returns data, changes nothing) — **never both**.
- The spirit: **"Asking a question should not change the answer."**
- Pure queries give you four freedoms — **repeat, reorder, cache, remove** — which make code predictable, testable, and safe to log/assert against.
- A getter that secretly mutates is the classic bug: observing the program changes it.
- CQS is a **strong default with conscious exceptions**: `Stack.pop()` returns *and* removes for **atomicity**, and that's fine when done deliberately.
- Don't confuse **CQS** (one object's methods) with **CQRS** (a system-level architecture) — same idea, very different scope.
