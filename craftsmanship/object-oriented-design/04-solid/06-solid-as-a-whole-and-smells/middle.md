## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** and **When**

At the junior level you learned the smell-to-principle map. At the middle level the question becomes *judgement*: when several principles point in different directions, which one wins? When does applying SRP create an ISP problem? When is a `switch` statement actually fine and OCP the over-reaction?

The central middle-level insight: **the five principles are not a checklist you satisfy independently — they are a tension system you balance.** Apply SRP too aggressively and you shatter a cohesive class into anemic fragments, each needing its own interface (now an ISP and DIP burden). Chase OCP everywhere and you drown in single-implementation abstractions (a YAGNI violation). The skill is reading which principle the *current* code and the *current* change actually need, and stopping there.

---

## How the Principles Reinforce Each Other

The junior interlock web showed the dependency structure. Here is *why* each link makes the others stronger, with the mechanism spelled out.

### SRP makes everything else achievable

A single-responsibility class is the precondition for the other four:

- It has a **small, coherent interface** — so ISP is satisfied almost for free.
- It is **easy to substitute** — fewer responsibilities means fewer promises to keep, so LSP holds more easily.
- It has **one axis of variation** — so the OCP seam (if you need one) is obvious and clean.
- It is **easy to depend on through an abstraction** — DIP works because there's one clear thing to abstract.

> A god class violates SRP *and* makes SOLID compliance impossible for the other four, because there's no clean seam to put an interface on. Fix SRP first; the rest get easier.

### OCP, DIP, and LSP are a single mechanism

These three describe one move from three angles:

- **DIP** says: *point the dependency at an abstraction.*
- **OCP** says: *now you can add a new implementation behind that abstraction without editing the caller.*
- **LSP** says: *and the caller can trust any implementation you plug in.*

Remove any one and the other two collapse. DIP without LSP gives you a seam whose implementations the caller can't trust (so it adds `instanceof` checks, killing OCP). OCP without DIP has nowhere to plug the extension in. They are best understood as **one capability — "extend behavior by adding a substitutable implementation behind an abstraction"** — that SOLID happens to name in three parts.

### ISP sharpens DIP

DIP says depend on an abstraction; ISP says make that abstraction *the right size*. A fat abstraction re-creates the coupling DIP tried to remove: depend on a 12-method interface and you're transitively coupled to all 12 methods' reasons to change, even if you call one. ISP trims the abstraction down to exactly what *this* client needs — completing DIP's decoupling.

## How the Principles Tension Each Other

Reinforcement is the happy story. The harder, more useful story is the **tensions** — the cases where pushing one principle works against another. Middle engineers earn their title by navigating these.

| Tension | What happens | Resolution heuristic |
|---|---|---|
| **SRP ⇄ "fewest classes"** | Splitting responsibilities multiplies classes; taken too far you get anemic fragments and navigation overhead. | Split on **real, distinct reasons to change** — not on every verb. If two "responsibilities" always change together, they're one. |
| **OCP ⇄ YAGNI** | Adding an abstraction "to be open for extension" before any second case exists = speculative generality. | Add the OCP seam when the **second variant is real** (or a test double needs it), not on the first. |
| **ISP ⇄ SRP-driven fragmentation** | Aggressive interface splitting can produce a swarm of one-method interfaces that obscure the design. | Segregate by **client role**, not by method count. One interface per *kind of caller*, not per method. |
| **DIP ⇄ simplicity** | Inverting every dependency adds indirection; a tiny script doesn't need a `Notifier` interface. | Invert dependencies that **cross a boundary you'll want to swap or test**; leave trivial, stable internals concrete. |
| **OCP ⇄ DRY / clarity** | An over-flexible plugin architecture for a closed, stable set of cases is harder to read than a plain `switch`. | If the set of variants is **genuinely closed and stable**, an explicit switch can beat a polymorphic maze. |

The meta-rule: **SOLID principles are heuristics, and heuristics conflict.** When they do, fall back to the *purpose* — making change cheap and local — and to the [KISS](../../01-generic/01-kiss/)/[YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/) counterweights. The principle that serves an actual, present need wins; the one serving a hypothetical loses.

## Applying the Full Set to Real Code

Let's take a more realistic module than the junior toy: a **payment-processing service** that charges an order and records the result. We'll diagnose the smells, then apply the whole set.

### The starting code (Python) — smells flagged

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def process(self, order):
        # validate
        if order.total <= 0:
            raise ValueError("bad total")

        # pick gateway by string code            ← OCP smell (switch on type)
        if order.method == "card":
            stripe = StripeClient(api_key=os.environ["STRIPE_KEY"])  # ← DIP smell
            resp = stripe.charge(order.card_token, order.total)
        elif order.method == "paypal":
            pp = PayPalClient(secret=os.environ["PP_SECRET"])        # ← DIP smell
            resp = pp.pay(order.paypal_id, order.total)
        else:
            raise ValueError("unknown method")

        # persist the receipt                     ← SRP smell (second responsibility)
        db = PostgresConnection()                                    # ← DIP smell
        db.execute("INSERT INTO receipts ...", resp.id, order.id)

        # email the customer                      ← SRP smell (third responsibility)
        SmtpClient().send(order.email, f"Paid: {resp.id}")          # ← DIP smell
        return resp
```

One method **validates, routes, charges, persists, and emails**, constructing four concrete clients along the way. Five smells, four principles. We refactor in the smell→principle order that keeps each step small.

### Step 1 — SRP: separate the reasons to change

```python
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, gateway, receipts, notifier):
        self._gateway = gateway          # charging
        self._receipts = receipts        # persistence
        self._notifier = notifier        # customer comms

    def process(self, order):
        self._validate(order)
        result = self._gateway.charge(order)
        self._receipts.save(result, order)
        self._notifier.payment_succeeded(order, result)
        return result
```

`PaymentProcessor` now *orchestrates*; it no longer *is* the gateway, the database, and the mailer. Each of those is one reason to change, owned by one collaborator.

### Step 2 — DIP: the collaborators are abstractions, injected

```python
class PaymentGateway(Protocol):
    def charge(self, order) -> ChargeResult: ...
class ReceiptStore(Protocol):
    def save(self, result, order) -> None: ...
class CustomerNotifier(Protocol):
    def payment_succeeded(self, order, result) -> None: ...
```

`PaymentProcessor` depends only on these protocols and receives concrete implementations from outside (the composition root). High-level policy no longer points at Stripe, Postgres, or SMTP.

### Step 3 — OCP: new gateways are new classes

```python
class StripeGateway:
    def __init__(self, client): self._client = client
    def charge(self, order):
        r = self._client.charge(order.card_token, order.total)
        return ChargeResult(id=r.id, status=r.status)

class PayPalGateway:
    def __init__(self, client): self._client = client
    def charge(self, order):
        r = self._client.pay(order.paypal_id, order.total)
        return ChargeResult(id=r.id, status=r.status)

# Adding ApplePay = add ApplePayGateway. PaymentProcessor is untouched.  ← OCP
```

### Step 4 — LSP: every gateway honors the `charge` contract

The contract is: *`charge(order)` attempts payment and returns a `ChargeResult`, raising only on a genuine payment failure.* Every gateway must obey it. A gateway that returned `None` on success, or threw `NotImplementedError` for refunds it inherited, would force the processor to special-case it — breaking substitution and OCP. We keep the contract uniform and document it.

### Step 5 — ISP: don't fatten the gateway interface

Suppose refunds arrive. The temptation is to add `refund()` to `PaymentGateway`. But not every caller refunds, and not every gateway supports it identically. Segregate:

```python
class PaymentGateway(Protocol):
    def charge(self, order) -> ChargeResult: ...

class Refundable(Protocol):                 # separate role interface  ← ISP
    def refund(self, charge_id) -> RefundResult: ...
# A gateway that can refund implements BOTH; one that can't implements only PaymentGateway,
# instead of being forced to stub refund() with UnsupportedOperationException (which would
# also be an LSP violation).
```

Notice how **ISP and LSP cooperate here**: segregating `Refundable` out means no gateway is ever forced to stub a method it can't honor — which is exactly the situation that produces LSP-violating `UnsupportedOperationException` throws.

### The payoff

Adding Apple Pay touches zero existing classes. Swapping Postgres for DynamoDB means one new `ReceiptStore` implementation. Testing `PaymentProcessor` needs no real Stripe, DB, or SMTP — just in-memory fakes that satisfy the protocols. That testability is the *practical* reason DIP exists, and it's the clearest signal you applied the set correctly.

## The Smell Catalog, Deepened

The junior table mapped smells to principles. The middle skill is reading the smell *in context* — knowing when it's real and when it's a false alarm.

| Smell | Principle | When it's a **real** violation | When it's a **false alarm** |
|---|---|---|---|
| `switch`/`if` on a type code | OCP | The set of cases grows over time and each addition edits the switch | The set is **closed and stable** (e.g., the four suits in a deck); a switch is clearer than polymorphism |
| `instanceof` / downcast | LSP | Callers must check the concrete type to call the right behavior | Deliberate pattern-matching over a **sealed/sum type** (Kotlin `sealed`, Rust `enum`, `switch` over a closed hierarchy) |
| `throw new UnsupportedOperationException()` | LSP | A subtype refuses an inherited promise callers rely on | An interface method that is *contractually optional* and documented as such (rare; usually a design smell itself) |
| Fat interface | ISP | Different clients use disjoint subsets of the methods | One cohesive client genuinely uses all the methods together |
| Empty/stub method | ISP / LSP | The class can't honor the method but was forced to implement it | A legitimately empty hook with a documented default (e.g., a lifecycle callback) |
| `new ConcreteService()` in business logic | DIP | The concretion crosses a boundary you'll swap or test | The "concretion" is a trivial value object or a stable standard-library type (no need to abstract `new ArrayList()`) |
| Shotgun surgery | SRP | One conceptual change edits many files | The edits are genuinely independent changes that happened to land together |

> **The unifying test:** a smell is a real violation when it makes a *likely future change* expensive or risky. If the change it guards against will never happen (closed set, stable concretion), applying the principle is over-engineering. Smells are *priors*, not verdicts.

---

## Trade-offs

| You gain (applying SOLID) | You pay |
|---|---|
| Change becomes local — add a class instead of editing many | More classes/interfaces to navigate |
| Testability — inject fakes, no real I/O in unit tests | Indirection — "where does this actually run?" gets harder to trace |
| Reuse — modules drag fewer dependencies | Up-front design effort to find the right seams |
| Parallel work — teams own implementations behind shared abstractions | Risk of speculative abstractions that never pay off (YAGNI) |

The honest framing: **SOLID trades local simplicity for global flexibility.** That trade is worth it where change is likely and costly; it's a *loss* where the code is stable and small. The middle engineer applies it *selectively*, at the boundaries that actually move.

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. The legitimately closed set

A `switch` over the seven days of the week, or the four card suits, is not an OCP violation — the set will never grow. Forcing polymorphism here adds classes for no flexibility benefit. OCP guards *open* axes of variation; closed sets aren't one.

### 2. The single-implementation interface

An interface with one implementation is *usually* a YAGNI smell, not DIP done right. The exception: you need a **test double** *now*, or you're crossing a published boundary (a plugin API). A test seam is a present requirement, so the interface is justified — but say so explicitly.

### 3. SRP vs. cohesion

Splitting a class because it "has two methods" can *lower* cohesion if those methods share state and always change together. SRP is about *reasons to change*, which is a cohesion question — group what changes together (see [Maximise Cohesion](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/02-maximise-cohesion/)). Over-splitting manufactures coupling between fragments that should have stayed one.

### 4. LSP in languages without inheritance

In Go (structural typing) or Rust (traits), there's no class inheritance, but LSP still applies to *interface/trait implementations*: any type satisfying an interface must honor the interface's contract. The "subtype" is "any implementer." `UnsupportedOperationException`-style violations become `panic("not implemented")` — same smell, same principle.

---

## Tricky Points

- **SOLID is not five things to "always do."** It's five lenses to *diagnose* a design when a change hurts. Applying all five preemptively to trivial code is the classic over-engineering trap.
- **The principles share a root: dependency management.** SRP, OCP, DIP, ISP are all about *who depends on whom and why*; LSP is about *whether a dependency's substitutes are trustworthy*. If you remember one thing: SOLID is about controlling the direction and trustworthiness of dependencies.
- **A clean OCP seam can hide an LSP bug.** Polymorphism makes the caller blind to which implementation it holds — which is the point, but it means an LSP-violating implementation fails *silently* at runtime instead of loudly at compile time. OCP raises the stakes on LSP.
- **ISP failures often masquerade as LSP failures.** The empty/throwing stub method is caused by a fat interface (ISP) but *manifests* as a broken substitute (LSP). Fix the interface (ISP) and the LSP symptom disappears.
- **"Depends on an interface" ≠ DIP.** If the interface lives in the low-level module and the high-level module imports *down* to get it, the dependency still points the wrong way. DIP requires the abstraction to be owned by (or at least point toward) the high-level policy.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Fix SRP first.** A single-responsibility class makes the other four tractable. Untangle responsibilities before adding interfaces.
2. **Treat OCP/DIP/LSP as one move.** When you add a seam, make it an abstraction (DIP) with a trustworthy contract (LSP) that you extend by adding (OCP).
3. **Segregate interfaces by client role, not by method count** (ISP). One interface per *kind of caller*.
4. **Earn abstractions; don't speculate them.** Add the seam when the second case or a test double is real — hold the line with [YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/).
5. **Read smells in context.** Ask "does this make a *likely* change expensive?" A smell over a closed/stable set is a false alarm.
6. **Use injectability as your check.** If you can unit-test the high-level class with fakes and no real I/O, your DIP/OCP/ISP are probably right.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Why is fixing SRP a precondition for cleanly applying the other four?
2. Explain why OCP, DIP, and LSP are "one move seen from three angles."
3. Give a tension between two SOLID principles and the heuristic that resolves it.
4. You see a `switch` statement. What single question decides whether it's an OCP violation?
5. How do ISP and LSP cooperate when you split a `Refundable` interface out of `PaymentGateway`?
6. Why does a clean OCP seam *raise the stakes* on LSP?

---

## Summary

- The five principles form a **tension system**, not an independent checklist. They reinforce each other (SRP enables all; OCP+DIP+LSP are one move; ISP sharpens DIP) and they conflict (OCP vs. YAGNI, SRP vs. cohesion, ISP vs. fragmentation).
- Applying the **full set** to real code follows the smell→principle order: untangle SRP, invert dependencies (DIP), make extension additive (OCP), keep substitutes trustworthy (LSP), keep interfaces lean (ISP). **Injectability/testability is the check that you got it right.**
- The **smell catalog** must be read *in context*: a smell is a real violation only when it makes a *likely* future change expensive. Over a closed, stable set, the same "smell" is a false alarm.
- The unifying root of SOLID is **dependency management** — controlling the direction and trustworthiness of dependencies so that change stays local.
