## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** and **When**

At the junior level, SRP is a definition you can recite: *one class, one actor.* At the middle level it becomes a set of judgement calls you make daily. The hard part is never the principle — it's two operational questions:

1. **How do I find the actors** in a class that wasn't designed with them in mind?
2. **When have I split too far** — turning one understandable class into a dust cloud of tiny ones?

Most engineers, once they "get" SRP, swing too hard and start splitting everything, because over-splitting *looks* disciplined. The middle-level skill is calibration: split along **real actor boundaries**, and stop. SRP applied without judgement produces a **class explosion** that is, in its own way, as hard to maintain as the god class you started with — you've traded one big tangle for a hundred-file scavenger hunt.

---

## Finding the Actors in Real Code

The principle says "one actor per class," but production code rarely labels its actors. Here is the practical procedure to surface them.

**1. List the reasons the class has changed historically.** Open the git log for the file. Each *distinct kind* of change (a tax tweak, a UI relayout, a query optimisation) hints at an actor.

**2. Ask "who requested it?" for each reason.** Tie every change-reason to a role: finance, marketing/design, ops, platform/infra, security, the DBAs. Different requesters → different actors.

**3. Group the methods by actor.** Methods that always change for the same requester belong together; methods that change for *different* requesters are your split lines.

**4. Look for vocabulary shifts.** Within one class, a jump from `taxBracket` to `<td>` to `connectionPool` is three vocabularies — almost always three actors.

```python
class InvoiceManager:               # which actors hide here?
    def total(self): ...            # finance  — pricing/tax rules
    def to_pdf(self): ...           # design   — document layout
    def email_to(self, addr): ...   # infra    — delivery channel
    def persist(self): ...          # DBA      — storage
```

`InvoiceManager` answers to **four** actors. The vague `Manager` suffix is itself a symptom — when you can't name a class for a single responsibility, you've usually bundled several.

> **Heuristic:** if you describe the class and your description contains the word *"and"* connecting two different *vocabularies* (not two steps of the same vocabulary), each side is probably a separate responsibility.

---

## Refactoring a God Class by Actor

Take the `InvoiceManager` above and split it the way you would in practice — incrementally, behind tests.

### Step 1 — pin behaviour with tests (Rule 1 of any refactor)

You cannot safely split without tests. Write characterization tests for `total`, `to_pdf`, `email_to`, and `persist` that capture *current* behaviour, so the refactor can't silently change anything.

### Step 2 — extract one actor at a time

```python
# Data + the rules the BUSINESS owns stay in the domain object.
class Invoice:
    def __init__(self, lines): self.lines = lines
    def total(self):                       # finance actor — domain rule, stays
        return sum(l.price * l.qty for l in self.lines) * (1 + VAT_RATE)

# Each other actor moves to its own class.
class InvoicePdfRenderer:                  # design actor
    def render(self, invoice: Invoice) -> bytes: ...

class InvoiceMailer:                       # infra actor
    def send(self, pdf: bytes, to: str): ...

class InvoiceRepository:                   # DBA actor
    def save(self, invoice: Invoice): ...
```

Note a subtlety: `total()` is a *domain rule* owned by the business/finance actor, and the `Invoice` object *is* the natural home for that one actor's behaviour. SRP does **not** say "models must be anaemic bags of data" — it says each class answers to one actor. The `Invoice` answers to finance; that's allowed.

### Step 3 — orchestrate in a thin coordinator

```python
class IssueInvoice:                        # one responsibility: the use case
    def __init__(self, renderer, mailer, repo):
        self._renderer, self._mailer, self._repo = renderer, mailer, repo
    def execute(self, invoice: Invoice, customer_email: str):
        self._repo.save(invoice)
        pdf = self._renderer.render(invoice)
        self._mailer.send(pdf, customer_email)
```

The coordinator's single reason to change is "the *steps* of issuing an invoice change." That's a legitimate, distinct responsibility (the workflow), separate from *how* each step is implemented.

---

## SRP at Three Levels: Function, Class, Module

SRP is usually taught at the class level, but the same "one reason to change" idea scales up and down.

| Level | "One responsibility" means | Violation looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **Function** | One level of abstraction; does *or* answers, not both | A function that validates, computes, *and* writes to the DB |
| **Class** | Responsible to one actor | The `Employee` with `calculatePay`/`reportHours`/`save` |
| **Module / package** | Serves one actor or bounded context | A `utils` package importing the web framework, the ORM, *and* the mailer |

The actor framing is cleanest at the class and module level. At the **function** level it shades into "do one thing" / command-query separation — and that's fine, because functions are small enough that "one level of abstraction" is a workable test. The mistake is dragging the function-level "do one thing" *up* to the class level, where it becomes the "one method per class" anti-pattern. **Use the actor test at the class/module level; use the abstraction-level test at the function level.**

---

## SRP Is Cohesion

Here is the unifying insight a middle engineer should internalise: **SRP and high cohesion are the same property, named twice.**

- [**Cohesion**](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/02-maximise-cohesion/) measures how well the elements *inside* a module belong together.
- **SRP** says the elements belong together when they **change for the same reason** (the same actor).

So "maximise cohesion" and "one reason to change" are the same instruction. The most desirable form of cohesion — *functional* cohesion (everything in the module contributes to a single well-defined task) — is exactly what SRP produces. The worst form — *coincidental* cohesion (the `Util` grab-bag) — is exactly an SRP violation.

```text
COHESION SPECTRUM (low → high)
  coincidental → logical → temporal → procedural → communicational → sequential → FUNCTIONAL
  └─ "Util grab-bag"                                                          └─ SRP target
     (SRP violation)                                                            (one actor)
```

When you split a god class by actor, you are *raising its cohesion* toward functional. SRP is the actionable rule; cohesion is the underlying quality.

---

## The Facade Pattern as the SRP Companion

Splitting a class multiplies the objects a caller must coordinate. The **Facade** restores a single, simple entry point without re-merging the responsibilities.

```typescript
// Behind the facade: three single-responsibility classes
class UserFacade {
  constructor(
    private repo: UserRepository,     // DBA actor
    private mailer: WelcomeMailer,    // infra actor
    private auditor: AuditLog,        // security/compliance actor
  ) {}

  register(user: User): void {
    this.repo.save(user);
    this.mailer.sendWelcome(user);
    this.auditor.record("user.registered", user.id);
  }
}
```

The facade gives callers one method (`register`) while each responsibility stays isolated. Crucially, the facade itself has **one reason to change** — the registration *workflow*. It is *not* an SRP violation just because it touches three collaborators; it doesn't *implement* persistence, mail, or auditing — it *coordinates* them. Coordinating is itself a single responsibility.

> **The distinction that matters:** a class that *implements* three concerns violates SRP; a class that *delegates to* three single-responsibility classes does not. Delegation is one responsibility (orchestration); implementation-of-many is several.

---

## Over-Application: The Class Explosion

SRP's failure mode is **over-application**, and it's seductive because it masquerades as rigour.

```text
   "calculate pay" becomes:
     PayCalculator
       → OvertimePolicy
         → OvertimePolicyFactory
           → OvertimePolicyConfig
             → OvertimePolicyConfigLoader
               → ... for a 3-line formula
```

When you split past the actor boundary, you get:

- **Navigation cost.** Understanding one feature means opening fifteen files and chasing the call chain across all of them. The logic is no longer anywhere; it's *between* everywhere.
- **Indirection without payoff.** Each tiny class adds an interface, a constructor, a wiring line in the DI container — ceremony serving no actual variation.
- **Lost locality.** Code that conceptually belongs together (because it's one actor's logic) is scattered, so a single change becomes **shotgun surgery** — the *opposite* smell from the god class, but just as painful.

The line is the **actor**, not the **operation**. `PayCalculator` answers to finance and may legitimately contain the overtime formula, the tax lookup, and the rounding rule — *all finance's concern, one actor.* Splitting those into separate classes doesn't improve SRP; it manufactures a class explosion. SRP says split when a *second actor* appears, never to chase a lower method count.

---

## When NOT to Split

Knowing when to *stop* is the senior-track skill. Don't split when:

1. **There's only one real actor.** Many methods, one requester → leave it whole. A `Stack`, a `Money` value object, a `Matrix` — rich behaviour, one reason to change.
2. **The "second actor" is speculative.** You *imagine* design and finance might diverge, but today they're the same team changing things together. Split when the second actor is *real*, not anticipated. (This is [YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/) applied to SRP.)
3. **Splitting would force a worse smell.** If extracting a class drags shared state across the boundary, you may create more coupling than you remove. Sometimes the cohesive whole is genuinely the simplest design.
4. **The program is tiny.** A 200-line script with one author and one change-source has, effectively, one actor. Ceremonial splitting buys nothing.

> SRP is a heuristic, not a law. The cost of a split (more elements, more indirection, more navigation) is real and must be paid for by a real benefit (an actual second actor whose changes you're isolating). No second actor, no benefit, no split.

---

## Trade-offs

| Dimension | Keep cohesive (don't split) | Split by responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Number of elements | Few | More (classes, interfaces, wiring) |
| Change isolation | Low — actors share a file | High — each actor isolated |
| Navigation cost | Low (logic is local) | Higher (logic spread across files) |
| Risk of accidental coupling | High when ≥2 actors share code | Low |
| Testability | Often poor (must mock unrelated machinery) | Good (test one concern in isolation) |
| Best when | One real actor; small program | Two or more real, diverging actors |

The asymmetry: an **under-split** class (god class) hurts every time *two different actors* both need to change — frequent, expensive, bug-prone. An **over-split** design hurts every time you *read or navigate* — constant low-grade friction. The right cut is at the actor boundary, where you pay the split cost exactly once per genuine source of change.

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. The model that "must" persist itself (Active Record)

Frameworks like Rails/Django put `save()` on the model (`user.save()`). This *technically* mixes the domain actor and the DBA actor in one class. It's a deliberate trade: the productivity of Active Record vs. SRP purity. For small/medium apps it's often the right call; as persistence logic grows complex, teams extract repositories. Know that it's a **conscious trade-off**, not an oversight.

### 2. The "and" that's actually one responsibility

"This class parses *and* validates the config." Parsing and validating a config might be **one** actor (whoever owns the config format), changing together. The "and" test is a *hint*, not proof — confirm by checking whether the two parts change for *different* reasons.

### 3. A genuinely cross-cutting concern

Logging, metrics, and auth touch every class. You don't give each class a "logging responsibility"; you extract the cross-cutting concern (via a decorator, middleware, or aspect) so the core class keeps its single responsibility. (See [Separation of Concerns](../../01-generic/03-separation-of-concerns/).)

---

## Tricky Points

- **Actors, not nouns, define the split.** Splitting `Employee` into `EmployeeName`/`EmployeeSalary` decomposes *data*; SRP wants you to split by *reason to change* (finance vs. ops vs. DBA), which cuts *across* those nouns.
- **SRP ≠ anaemic models.** Putting *behaviour* on a class is fine as long as it's *one actor's* behaviour. The mistake is mixing actors, not having logic.
- **A facade/coordinator touching many classes is not an SRP violation** — orchestration is itself one responsibility. Implementing many concerns is the violation; *delegating* to many is not.
- **The actor boundary depends on your organisation.** If two "different" concerns always change together because one team owns both, they may be one actor *for you*. SRP is defined by your real sources of change, not a universal catalogue.
- **Over-splitting causes shotgun surgery** — the inverse smell. Both the god class and the dust cloud make one logical change expensive; the sweet spot is the actor boundary.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Find actors from the git history.** Past change-reasons reveal the real axes of change better than guessing.
2. **Split at the actor boundary — and stop there.** Not per operation, not per noun.
3. **Move presentation and persistence out of domain models** (the two most common foreign actors), but keep *domain rules* in the domain object.
4. **Use a Facade** to preserve a single entry point after splitting.
5. **Apply [YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/) to SRP:** split when the second actor is *real*, not anticipated.
6. **Treat the `Manager`/`Util`/`Processor` suffix as a smell** — it usually marks an unnamed bundle of responsibilities.
7. **Refactor behind characterization tests**, one actor at a time, in small commits.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Give a practical procedure for finding the actors hidden in a god class.
2. Why is "SRP is cohesion restated" an accurate statement? Which cohesion type is the SRP target?
3. Why is a facade/coordinator that calls three classes *not* an SRP violation?
4. Describe the class-explosion failure mode and the smell it causes.
5. Name three situations where you should *not* split a class.
6. How does the right level (function vs. class) change which "one responsibility" test you apply?

---

## Summary

- The middle-level skill is **finding the real actors** (best surfaced from change history) and **splitting only at actor boundaries** — never per operation or per noun.
- **SRP is cohesion restated**: it targets *functional cohesion*, where every element changes for one actor's reason.
- A **Facade** preserves a single entry point after splitting; a facade/coordinator is **not** an SRP violation because *orchestration is one responsibility*.
- **Over-application** produces a **class explosion** → navigation cost, indirection, and **shotgun surgery** (the inverse smell). The line is the actor, not the operation.
- **Don't split** when there's one real actor, the second actor is speculative ([YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/)), splitting worsens coupling, or the program is tiny.
- SRP scales across **function / class / module** levels, but the *actor* test belongs at class/module level; the *abstraction-level* test belongs at function level.
