## Introduction

> Focus: **theory** and **system-level reasoning**

At the senior level, SRP stops being "split classes by actor" and becomes a lens on a deeper question: **what is the unit of independent change in a system, and how do you align your boundaries with it?** SRP is one local heuristic for a global property — that the system should be *decomposable* so that each foreseeable change touches as few places as possible, and as few *teams* as possible.

This file covers the three things a senior must be able to reason about:

1. **The precise theory underneath SRP** — it is cohesion, and cohesion is best formalised as *[connascence](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/03-connascence/)*. "One reason to change" is a statement about *connascence of meaning and execution* being kept local.
2. **The tension SRP lives in** — it can fight low coupling, simplicity, and locality. Splitting always adds elements; senior judgement is knowing when the actor boundary is worth the cost.
3. **The organisational dimension** — actors are *people*, so SRP is secretly about [Conway's Law](#the-conways-law-connection): aligning code boundaries with team boundaries.

---

## SRP, Cohesion, and the Closure of Reasons-to-Change

The cleanest senior framing of SRP is the **Common Closure Principle** (CCP), SRP's component-level sibling:

> **The classes in a component should be closed against the same kinds of changes. A change that affects the component affects all its classes and no others.**

SRP is CCP applied to a single class: a class should be *closed* against exactly one kind of change (one actor's). This reframes SRP as a statement about **closure** — you draw the boundary so that one reason-to-change is fully *contained* inside it and never leaks across it. A change either:

- stays entirely inside one class (good — the boundary captured the responsibility), or
- forces edits across several classes (bad — the responsibility was split across boundaries, i.e. **shotgun surgery**), or
- forces *unrelated* behaviour in the same class to break (bad — two responsibilities share a boundary, the classic god-class coupling).

SRP, then, is **maximising the closure of each reason-to-change**: every actor's changes fully contained, no actor's changes bleeding into another's. This is just **[functional cohesion](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/02-maximise-cohesion/)** stated in change-terms — the highest, most desirable cohesion, where a module's elements are unified by serving one purpose for one actor.

> SRP is not really about classes at all. It's about ensuring each *axis of change* is captured by exactly one boundary — neither split across several (shotgun surgery) nor sharing one with a different axis (god class). Both failures are *misaligned closure*.

---

## SRP Through Connascence

"One reason to change" is vague; **[connascence](../../02-coupling-and-cohesion/03-connascence/)** (Meilir Page-Jones) makes it precise. Two elements are *connascent* if a change in one requires a corresponding change in the other to keep the system correct. SRP violations are, mechanically, **strong connascence that crosses an actor boundary.**

Consider the `Employee`/`regularHours()` bug from the junior level: `calculatePay()` and `reportHours()` share a helper, so they are bound by **connascence of algorithm** (both rely on the same hour-computation logic). That connascence is fine *if both belong to one actor*. The defect is that the two methods answer to **different actors** — so a change driven by one actor propagates, via the connascence, into the other's behaviour. SRP's prescription ("separate things that change for different reasons") is exactly: **do not let connascence span an actor boundary.**

This gives a sharper rule than "one reason to change":

> **Keep strong connascence inside an actor boundary; allow only weak connascence (name, type) to cross it.**

The three connascence properties map directly onto SRP refactoring:

| Connascence property | SRP move |
|---|---|
| **Strength** (weaken it) | Replace a shared mutable helper (algorithm/execution connascence) with separate, named code per actor — degrading cross-boundary connascence to mere *name* connascence. |
| **Locality** (localise it) | Pull each actor's strongly-connascent code into one class, so the strong connascence stays *inside* the boundary. |
| **Degree** (lower it) | Fewer elements entangled across actors. |

So the senior reframing of SRP: **don't "separate responsibilities" — localise strong connascence within actor boundaries and weaken any that must cross them.** This instantly explains why splitting a `Stack` is wrong (its methods are strongly connascent *and* serve one actor — keep them together) and why splitting `Employee` is right (strong connascence spanning three actors — break it).

---

## SRP vs. Coupling: Two Forces in Tension

A naive reading is "SRP reduces coupling." It does — *across actor boundaries.* But splitting can also *increase* coupling of another kind, and seniors must see both effects.

When you extract `PayCalculator`, `HourReporter`, and `EmployeeRepository` from `Employee`, you:

- **Reduce coupling between actors** (accounting's changes no longer reach operations' code). ✅
- **Introduce structural coupling between the new classes** — they must now collaborate, be wired together, and agree on shared data (`EmployeeData`). They are coupled by *name and type* (weak connascence), which is the *good* trade. ⚠️

The senior judgement: SRP is worth it when it **trades strong, hidden, cross-actor coupling (connascence of meaning/algorithm) for weak, explicit, structural coupling (connascence of name/type).** That trade almost always pays off — explicit weak coupling is visible and cheap; hidden strong coupling is the source of the "why did *that* break?" bugs. But the trade is *not free*, and when there's only one actor, you'd be adding weak coupling and indirection for no reduction in strong coupling — a net loss. **No second actor → no coupling to reduce → don't split.**

## Why "Reason to Change" Is Ambiguous — and How Actors Fix It

Uncle Bob himself acknowledged that "reason to change" is the weakest phrasing, because *everything* can change for many reasons and engineers argue endlessly about whether two changes are "the same reason." The **actor** reframing resolves this by grounding "reason" in something observable: a **person or role who requests changes**.

This matters because it makes SRP **falsifiable in a design review**:

- "Is logging a separate responsibility from order processing?" — unanswerable in the abstract.
- "Does a *different stakeholder* request logging changes than order-processing changes?" — usually yes (platform/observability team vs. the product team) → separate responsibilities. Answerable.

The actor lens also exposes a non-obvious truth: **responsibilities are not intrinsic to the code; they are intrinsic to the organisation around it.** The *same* class can be SRP-compliant in one company and a violation in another, depending on whether the concerns it bundles map to one team or several. There is no universal, context-free decomposition — which is why SRP is a *design* skill, not a mechanical rule.

---

## The Conway's Law Connection

If actors are *people*, then SRP is, at bottom, an instance of **Conway's Law**:

> *Organisations design systems that mirror their communication structures.*

SRP says: align each module with **one actor** — i.e., **one team / one stakeholder**. Do this and you get the property Conway's Law predicts is healthy: a change requested by one team touches code owned by that team, reviewed by that team, deployed by that team — with no cross-team coordination. Violate SRP and you get the pathology: two teams share a file, every change needs the *other* team's review, and merge conflicts and coordination overhead tax every change.

> SRP is Conway's Law applied at the class level: **make code boundaries match team (actor) boundaries**, so the cost of change stays inside one team.

This is why senior SRP decisions are inseparable from org design. When you split `Employee` by CFO/COO/CTO actors, you are pre-aligning the code with the three departments that will request the changes — so future changes stay single-team. The "inverse Conway maneuver" (shaping teams to get the architecture you want) is the same insight run in reverse.

## SRP at the Module and Service Boundary

SRP scales from classes to components to microservices, and the actor framing scales with it:

| Scope | "One responsibility" | Misaligned-closure failure |
|---|---|---|
| Class | One actor | God class / shotgun surgery |
| Component / package | One reason-to-change family (CCP) | A change rebuilds half the system |
| Microservice | One bounded context / business capability | The "distributed monolith" — one change redeploys many services |

The **distributed monolith** is SRP failure at the service tier: services split by *technical layer* (a "validation service," a "formatting service") rather than by *business capability* (actor), so a single feature change ripples across every service — shotgun surgery over the network, the most expensive form. Conversely, a service that owns *several* business capabilities is a god-service. The same actor test applies: **split services where different stakeholders drive change, keep together what changes for one reason.** (See Event-Driven Architecture for how bounded contexts realise this.)

> The most expensive SRP violations are not in classes — they are in service boundaries, because there the "shotgun surgery" of a misaligned change becomes a multi-team, multi-deploy, distributed-transaction problem.

---

## SRP vs. Simplicity and Locality

SRP is in genuine, irreducible tension with two other goods, and a senior must hold the trade-off honestly.

**SRP vs. simplicity ([KISS](../../01-generic/01-kiss/) / fewest elements).** Every split *adds* elements: a class, an interface, a constructor, a line of wiring. [Simple design's "fewest elements" rule](../../../craftsmanship-disciplines/04-simple-design/) pushes *against* eager splitting. The resolution: SRP earns its elements only when there's a *real second actor*. Splitting for an imagined actor is **speculative generality** — an SRP-flavoured [YAGNI](../../01-generic/02-yagni/) violation.

**SRP vs. locality of behaviour.** There is real value in being able to read one cohesive unit top-to-bottom without jumping between files. Over-applied SRP destroys this: the logic for one *feature* is smeared across fifteen single-method classes, and no file tells the whole story. "Locality of behaviour" (the principle that code that changes together should be *readable* together) can pull *against* SRP's separation. The reconciliation is, again, the actor: **separate by actor (different reasons), keep local what serves one actor (same reason).** When you find yourself jumping across files to understand *one actor's* logic, you've over-split.

```text
   UNDER-SPLIT                SWEET SPOT                 OVER-SPLIT
   god class                  one class / actor          class explosion
   ──────────────             ──────────────             ──────────────
   strong cross-actor         strong connascence         feature logic smeared
   connascence (bugs)         localised per actor        across files (no locality)
   fails SRP                  ✅                         fails KISS + locality
```

## Advanced Examples

### Localising connascence: weakening a cross-actor shared helper (Java)

```java
// BEFORE — connascence of ALGORITHM crosses an actor boundary.
class Employee {
    private double regularHours() { /* overtime policy — finance's rule */ }
    double calculatePay()  { return regularHours() * rate * payMultiplier(); } // CFO
    Hours  reportHours()   { return new Hours(regularHours()); }               // COO
    // COO edits regularHours() → silently changes CFO's pay. Cross-actor bug.
}

// AFTER — each actor owns its own, named computation. Cross-boundary
// connascence degraded from ALGORITHM to NAME (they merely agree on a type).
class PayCalculator {                    // CFO actor
    Money calculatePay(Timesheet t) {
        return payableHours(t).times(rate).times(payMultiplier());
    }
    private Hours payableHours(Timesheet t) { /* finance's overtime policy */ }
}
class HourReporter {                     // COO actor
    Hours reportHours(Timesheet t) { /* operations' counting rule */ }
}
```

The two `…Hours` computations were *coincidentally* identical; binding them via a shared helper manufactured cross-actor connascence. Splitting them — even at the cost of a little duplication — is correct, because they answer to different actors and *will diverge*. (This is the "prefer duplication to the wrong abstraction" insight, now grounded in SRP.)

### A facade preserving SRP without a god class (TypeScript)

```typescript
// Each collaborator has ONE actor. The use-case object has ONE responsibility:
// the registration WORKFLOW (which itself has a single reason to change — the steps).
class RegisterUser {
  constructor(
    private users: UserRepository,    // DBA
    private email: WelcomeMailer,     // infra
    private audit: AuditLog,          // compliance
  ) {}
  async execute(cmd: RegisterCommand): Promise<void> {
    const user = User.create(cmd);    // domain rule — business actor
    await this.users.save(user);
    await this.email.sendWelcome(user);
    this.audit.record("user.registered", user.id);
  }
}
```

`RegisterUser` touches four actors' worth of *collaborators* but *implements* none of their concerns — it only sequences them. Orchestration is one responsibility. This is how you keep a single, readable entry point (locality of the *workflow*) while every implementation concern stays SRP-isolated.

## Liabilities

### Liability 1: "SRP" as a license for class explosion

The most common senior-level failure is over-application: splitting per *operation* instead of per *actor*, producing a dust cloud of one-method classes. This destroys locality and causes shotgun surgery — the inverse of the disease SRP treats. Split by actor; stop there.

### Liability 2: Confusing technical layers with responsibilities

Splitting by *mechanism* (a "ValidationService," a "MappingService") rather than by *actor/capability* yields anaemic, ripple-prone designs — the distributed monolith at the service tier, the lasagna of forwarding layers at the class tier. Responsibilities are defined by *who drives change*, not by technical role.

### Liability 3: Treating responsibilities as context-free

Believing there's a universal "correct" decomposition. The actor boundary depends on *your* organisation; importing another company's split (or a framework's) without checking your own actors yields boundaries that don't match your change pressure.

### Liability 4: Anaemic-domain over-correction

Mishearing "move persistence/presentation out of the model" as "models must hold no behaviour at all," producing anaemic data bags with all logic in procedural services. SRP permits — indeed encourages — domain behaviour on the model, *as long as it's one actor's* (the business's). The error is mixing actors, not having logic.

## Pros & Cons at the System Level

| Dimension | Strong SRP (split by actor) | Weak SRP (cohesive god classes) |
|---|---|---|
| Change isolation | High — one actor's change stays in one class | Low — actors collide in shared files |
| Accidental coupling (cross-actor bugs) | Low | High — the "why did that break?" defect |
| Team parallelism | High — code boundaries match teams (Conway) | Low — cross-team coordination per change |
| Testability | High — test one concern without unrelated machinery | Low — must stand up DB/mailer to test a formula |
| Element count / simplicity | Lower — more classes, wiring, indirection | Higher — fewer moving parts |
| Locality of behaviour | Lower if over-split — feature logic spread | Higher — but tangled with other actors |
| Navigation cost | Higher if over-split | Lower (until the god class grows) |
| Best when | Multiple real, diverging actors | One real actor; small program |

The senior synthesis: SRP wins decisively on **change isolation, accidental-coupling avoidance, team parallelism, and testability** — and loses on **element count and (if over-applied) locality/navigation**. Because the winning columns are about *cost of change* and the losing columns are about *cost of reading*, and most software is read-then-changed-many-times, SRP pays off *whenever there's a genuine second actor* — and is a net cost when there isn't.
