# Crash Reporting — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Crash Reporting** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
> **Topic:** [Crash Reporting Roadmap](README.md)
> **Focus:** Wiring a real reporter (Sentry / Crashlytics / Bugsnag) correctly. Grouping & fingerprinting so the dashboard stays usable. Breadcrumbs and context. Uploading symbols (source maps, dSYM, ProGuard) so traces are readable. Scrubbing PII before it ever leaves the process.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. The SDK Does the Plumbing; You Own the Policy

A real reporter handles the hard mechanics for free: capturing across all surfaces, offline queueing, retry with backoff, batching, payload compression, symbolication on the server. What it *cannot* know is your *policy*: how *your* crashes should group, what context *your* app should attach, and which of *your* fields are sensitive. Middle-level crash reporting is configuring policy on top of plumbing — not reimplementing plumbing.

### 2. Grouping Is the Feature

If you remember one thing: **the value of a crash reporter is grouping, and grouping is fragile.** A good fingerprint collapses thousands of events into one actionable issue. A bad fingerprint either *over-groups* (two different bugs look like one, so you fix one and the issue won't close) or *under-groups* (one bug shatters into thousands of issues because the message contains `order_id=8831`). Most "Sentry is noisy" complaints are grouping problems, not volume problems.

### 3. Context Is What Replaces the Repro

You can't reproduce a production crash. So the report must carry everything you'd otherwise reproduce: the user's path (breadcrumbs), the device/OS/release (tags), the relevant state (context), and the last network calls. Every field you attach is a question you won't have to ask a user who is never coming back. The art is attaching *enough* to diagnose, *without* attaching PII.

### 4. Enrichment and Scrubbing Are the Same Decision

The instant you decide "let's attach the user object so we know who's affected," you've made a scrubbing decision: *which* fields of that user object are safe? Email — no. Hashed ID — yes. You cannot enrich responsibly without scrubbing in the same breath. They are two sides of one config block (`beforeSend`), not two separate projects.

### 5. Symbol Upload Belongs in CI, Not in a Human's Memory

The single most reliable way to get unreadable production traces is to make symbol upload a manual step someone "remembers" to do. They'll forget on the hotfix release — the one you most need to read. Symbol upload must be a *non-optional, automated step of the release build*, gated so the build *fails* if symbols didn't upload. Treat it like running tests.

## Wiring a Real Reporter

The major reporters share a shape. Learn the shape once; the per-vendor differences are small.

| Reporter | Best fit | Symbolication | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sentry** | Everything — web, backend, mobile, native | Source maps, dSYM, PDB, ProGuard, DWARF | The de facto standard; self-hostable; rich grouping config |
| **Firebase Crashlytics** | Mobile (iOS/Android) first | dSYM (auto), NDK symbols, ProGuard mapping | Free; deep mobile/release-health integration; Google-owned |
| **Bugsnag (SmartBear)** | Mobile + web, stability-score focus | Source maps, dSYM, ProGuard | Strong "release stability" framing |
| **Breakpad / Crashpad** | Native desktop (C/C++), browsers, games | Breakpad `.sym` from your symbols | Generates **minidumps**; the engine behind many of the above for native |
| **sentry-native** | Native apps wanting Sentry's backend | DWARF/PDB via Crashpad/Breakpad under the hood | Bridges native minidumps into Sentry |

The universal init sequence (Sentry shown; others mirror it):

1. **Initialize as early as possible** — first line of `main`, before anything can fail.
2. **Pass the DSN** from config/env (never hard-code; it's an environment selector too).
3. **Set `release` and `environment`** — wired from the build, not typed.
4. **Set the sample rate** (`senior.md` topic; default to 1.0 for crashes at first).
5. **Register a `beforeSend` hook** for scrubbing (see below).
6. **Let the SDK install its handlers**, then chain *your* prior handler if you had one.

---

## Grouping & Fingerprinting

### How Default Grouping Works

Most reporters fingerprint by **the exception type + a normalized stack trace** (often the top N in-app frames). Two events with the same exception thrown from the same call path → same issue. This is right ~80% of the time and wrong in two predictable ways:

**Under-grouping (one bug → thousands of issues).** The default fingerprint includes the **message**, and your message contains a dynamic value:

```text
Error: failed to load order 8831    ← issue A
Error: failed to load order 9027    ← issue B   (same bug, different issue!)
Error: failed to load order 4410    ← issue C
```

Three issues, one bug. The fix: normalize the message *or* override the fingerprint to drop the variable part.

**Over-grouping (many bugs → one issue).** A generic frame at the top — a shared `assert`, a logging wrapper, a `panic` helper — makes unrelated crashes share a top frame and collapse into one giant issue. The fix: exclude the framework/helper frames so grouping keys off *your* code, or split the fingerprint by a distinguishing field.

### Overriding the Fingerprint

```js
// Sentry: pin grouping to a stable key, ignore the variable message.
Sentry.captureException(err, {
  fingerprint: ["order-load-failure"], // all "failed to load order N" → one issue
});
```

```python
# Sentry Python: same idea inside a scope.
with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:
    scope.fingerprint = ["payment", "gateway-timeout", gateway_name]
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(err)
```

The fingerprint should be **stable across occurrences of the same bug** and **distinct across different bugs**. Good ingredients: the logical operation, the exception type, the failing subsystem. Bad ingredients: IDs, timestamps, user names, anything per-request.

### Grouping Rules of Thumb

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| One bug shows as thousands of issues | Message has a dynamic ID | Normalize message or set explicit `fingerprint` |
| Fix shipped but issue won't auto-close | Over-grouped: two bugs share one issue | Split the fingerprint |
| Unrelated crashes share one giant issue | Generic top frame (assert/log wrapper) | Mark those frames "not in-app" so grouping skips them |
| Minified frames make grouping random | Symbols not uploaded | Fix symbol upload (next section) — grouping *depends* on readable frames |

> Note the last row: **grouping quality depends on symbolication.** Group by minified frames and a new build (with new minified names) re-shatters every issue. Symbols first, then grouping.

---

## Breadcrumbs & Context

A stack trace says *where*. Breadcrumbs say *what led there*. Context says *under what conditions*.

### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are a rolling buffer (typically the last ~100 events) automatically trimmed and attached on crash. Most SDKs auto-record common ones; you add the domain-specific ones.

```text
12:03:41  navigation  /products → /cart
12:03:48  http        GET /api/cart  500  890ms   ← the smoking gun
12:03:49  ui.click    button#checkout
12:03:49  ← CRASH: TypeError reading 'total' of null
```

The 500 on `/api/cart` *is* the bug: the cart came back null, and `renderCart` didn't guard it. The stack trace alone wouldn't have told you *why* the cart was null. Breadcrumbs did.

Add them at meaningful boundaries:

```js
Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
  category: "checkout",
  message: "applied coupon",
  level: "info",
  data: { couponLength: coupon.length }, // NOT the coupon code itself
});
```

> Breadcrumbs are a *prime* PII leak vector. Auto-recorded HTTP breadcrumbs include URLs (which may contain tokens in query strings) and sometimes request bodies. Scrub them (see PII section). The `data` you add should describe, not reveal — `couponLength`, not the coupon.

### Context and Tags

- **Tags** are indexed and filterable: `release`, `environment`, `os`, `device`, `feature_flag.new_checkout`. Use tags for things you'll want to *slice by* ("show me crashes on iOS 17 in v4.2.0 with new_checkout on").
- **Context** is freeform extra state attached for reading: the relevant config, the size of the cart, the state machine's current state. Not indexed; just there when you open the issue.

```python
sentry_sdk.set_tag("checkout.variant", "B")          # filterable
sentry_sdk.set_context("cart", {                      # readable
    "item_count": len(cart.items),
    "currency": cart.currency,
    # no prices, no user identity
})
```

### User Context — Carefully

You usually *do* want to know *how many users* a crash hit (for crash-free-users in `senior.md`). But the user object is where PII concentrates.

```js
Sentry.setUser({
  id: hash(user.id),     // stable, non-reversible identifier — YES
  // email: user.email,  // NO — strip it
  segment: user.plan,    // "free"/"pro" is fine, low cardinality, not PII
});
```

A hashed/opaque ID gives you "affected users count" without storing who they are.

## Symbol Upload — The Build Step You Can't Skip

Capture works without symbols. *Readable* traces don't. Symbol upload turns the gibberish into source — and it must happen at build time, automatically, for the exact build you ship.

| Platform | Symbol artifact | Upload tooling | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JS (web/Node)** | `*.js.map` source maps | `sentry-cli sourcemaps upload` / bundler plugin | After bundling, before/with deploy |
| **Android (Java/Kotlin)** | `mapping.txt` (R8/ProGuard) + NDK `.so` symbols | Sentry/Crashlytics Gradle plugin | During the release build |
| **iOS/macOS (Swift/ObjC)** | `.dSYM` bundles | `sentry-cli upload-dif` / Fastlane / Crashlytics run-script | Post-archive |
| **Windows (C/C++/.NET)** | `.pdb` | `sentry-cli upload-dif` | Post-build |
| **Go / Rust / C++ (Linux)** | DWARF (in binary or split debug) | `sentry-cli upload-dif` / keep unstripped binary | Post-build |

The canonical JS flow, automated:

```bash
# In CI, after the production bundle is built:
export SENTRY_RELEASE="myapp@4.2.0+$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"

sentry-cli releases new "$SENTRY_RELEASE"
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload ./dist \
    --release "$SENTRY_RELEASE" \
    --url-prefix '~/static/'         # match how files are served
sentry-cli releases finalize "$SENTRY_RELEASE"

# CRITICAL: do NOT ship the .map files to the public CDN.
# Upload them to Sentry, then delete from the deploy artifact.
rm ./dist/**/*.map
```

Three rules that catch teams out:

1. **The release name in the SDK must match the release the symbols were uploaded under**, byte for byte (`myapp@4.2.0+abc123`). A mismatch = symbols exist but never get applied. Wire both from the same source.
2. **Don't serve source maps publicly.** Upload them to your reporter, then strip them from the deployed bundle, or you've handed your source to anyone with DevTools.
3. **Gate the build on upload success.** If `sentry-cli` exits non-zero, fail the release. A "successful" deploy with no symbols is the trap.

> Native (`Breakpad`/`Crashpad`) is different: the device produces a **minidump** (compact memory snapshot), and you symbolicate *server-side* against `.sym` files you generated with `dump_syms` from your build. Same principle — symbols are per-build and uploaded out of band — but the mechanics are heavier; see `professional.md`.

---

## PII Scrubbing

Every report leaves your process and lands in a third party (or your own backend). The moment it does, anything sensitive in it is a liability — GDPR for personal data, PCI-DSS for card data, plain bad-news for auth tokens. Scrubbing happens in **three layers**:

1. **Don't collect it.** The cheapest scrubbing is never attaching the email in the first place. Default to hashed IDs and describe-don't-reveal data.
2. **`beforeSend` — scrub on the client, before upload.** A hook that runs on every event; redact known-sensitive fields, drop dangerous breadcrumbs, regex-out card/token patterns from messages.
3. **Server-side scrubbing — defense in depth.** Sentry's "Data Scrubbers" and `sensitive_fields` strip known patterns again on receipt, in case the client missed one.

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  sendDefaultPii: false,            // do NOT auto-attach IP, cookies, headers
  beforeSend(event) {
    // 1. Strip the user email if some code set it.
    if (event.user) delete event.user.email;

    // 2. Redact Authorization headers from HTTP breadcrumbs.
    for (const b of event.breadcrumbs?.values ?? []) {
      if (b.data?.headers?.Authorization) b.data.headers.Authorization = "[redacted]";
      if (typeof b.data?.url === "string") b.data.url = stripQueryTokens(b.data.url);
    }

    // 3. Regex out card numbers / tokens that leaked into the message.
    if (event.message) event.message = scrubSecrets(event.message);
    if (event.exception?.values) {
      for (const ex of event.exception.values) ex.value = scrubSecrets(ex.value || "");
    }
    return event; // return null to DROP the event entirely
  },
});

function scrubSecrets(s) {
  return s
    .replace(/\b\d{13,16}\b/g, "[card]")               // naive PAN
    .replace(/Bearer\s+[A-Za-z0-9._-]+/g, "Bearer [redacted]");
}
```

| Field | Default risk | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Email / name / phone | PII | Never send; strip in `beforeSend` |
| Auth token / cookie / API key | Secret | Strip from headers, messages, breadcrumbs |
| Card number / CVV | PCI-DSS | Regex-scrub; never log upstream either |
| Full request body | Often PII | Don't attach; or attach a redacted summary |
| IP address | PII in EU | `sendDefaultPii: false`; or truncate last octet |
| User ID | Low if opaque | Hash it; gives counts without identity |
| URL query string | May carry tokens | Strip query params or known token keys |

> The honest caveat: regex scrubbing is best-effort, not a guarantee. The *real* defense is not collecting sensitive data in the first place, plus scrubbing as a safety net. Treat `beforeSend` as the last line, not the only line. And test it: send a synthetic event containing a fake card number and confirm it arrives redacted.

## Code Examples

The four middle-level pillars — init, fingerprint, breadcrumb, scrub — in each language.

### Python (Sentry SDK)

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk import capture_exception, add_breadcrumb, set_tag

def scrub(event, hint):
    if event.get("user"):
        event["user"].pop("email", None)
    # drop the event entirely if it's a known-noisy handled error:
    exc = (event.get("exception") or {}).get("values") or []
    if exc and exc[0].get("type") == "BrokenPipeError":
        return None
    return event

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn=os.environ["SENTRY_DSN"],
    release=os.environ.get("APP_RELEASE", "unknown"),
    environment=os.environ.get("APP_ENV", "production"),
    send_default_pii=False,
    before_send=scrub,
    traces_sample_rate=0.0,   # crash capture is separate from perf tracing
)

def checkout(cart, user):
    set_tag("checkout.variant", cart.variant)
    add_breadcrumb(category="checkout", message="started",
                   data={"item_count": len(cart.items)})  # count, not contents
    try:
        return charge(cart)
    except GatewayTimeout as e:
        # surprising-but-survivable: report with a STABLE fingerprint, then re-raise
        with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:
            scope.fingerprint = ["payment", "gateway-timeout", cart.gateway]
            capture_exception(e)
        raise
```

### Go (sentry-go)

```go
import (
	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
)

func initCrashReporting(release string) {
	_ = sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
		Dsn:         os.Getenv("SENTRY_DSN"),
		Release:     release,                 // e.g. "svc@" + gitSHA
		Environment: os.Getenv("APP_ENV"),
		SendDefaultPII: false,
		BeforeSend: func(event *sentry.Event, hint *sentry.EventHint) *sentry.Event {
			if event.User.Email != "" {
				event.User.Email = "" // scrub
			}
			return event
		},
	})
}

// Each goroutine still needs its own recover -> report (junior lesson).
func guarded(work func()) {
	defer sentry.Recover() // sentry-go's recover-then-report helper
	work()
}

func chargeHandler(cart Cart) error {
	sentry.WithScope(func(scope *sentry.Scope) {
		scope.SetTag("checkout.variant", cart.Variant)
		scope.AddBreadcrumb(&sentry.Breadcrumb{
			Category: "checkout", Message: "started",
			Data: map[string]any{"item_count": len(cart.Items)},
		}, 100)
	})
	if err := charge(cart); err != nil {
		sentry.WithScope(func(scope *sentry.Scope) {
			scope.SetFingerprint([]string{"payment", "gateway-timeout", cart.Gateway})
			sentry.CaptureException(err)
		})
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```

### Java / Android (Sentry or Crashlytics)

```java
// Sentry init (Android: usually via SentryAndroid.init in Application.onCreate)
Sentry.init(options -> {
    options.setDsn(BuildConfig.SENTRY_DSN);
    options.setRelease("app@" + BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME + "+" + BuildConfig.GIT_SHA);
    options.setEnvironment("production");
    options.setSendDefaultPii(false);
    options.setBeforeSend((event, hint) -> {
        if (event.getUser() != null) event.getUser().setEmail(null); // scrub
        return event; // return null to drop
    });
});

// Stable fingerprint + breadcrumb for a surprising-but-handled failure:
void charge(Cart cart) {
    Sentry.addBreadcrumb(new Breadcrumb("checkout started"));
    try {
        gateway.charge(cart);
    } catch (GatewayTimeoutException e) {
        Sentry.withScope(scope -> {
            scope.setFingerprint(Arrays.asList("payment", "gateway-timeout", cart.gateway));
            scope.setTag("checkout.variant", cart.variant);
            Sentry.captureException(e);
        });
        throw e;
    }
}
```

> Android symbols: add the Sentry (or Crashlytics) Gradle plugin so `mapping.txt` and NDK `.so` symbols upload automatically on the release build. Without the plugin, every release crash is obfuscated `a.b.c`.

### Node.js (Sentry)

```js
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  sendDefaultPii: false,
  beforeSend(event) {
    if (event.user) delete event.user.email;
    return event;
  },
  beforeBreadcrumb(crumb) {
    // strip tokens from auto-recorded http breadcrumbs
    if (crumb.category === "http" && crumb.data?.url) {
      crumb.data.url = crumb.data.url.replace(/([?&](token|key)=)[^&]+/gi, "$1[redacted]");
    }
    return crumb;
  },
});

// uncaughtException + unhandledRejection are auto-wired by the SDK (junior lesson),
// but you still process.exit(1) after fatal ones in a server.
```

### Rust (sentry crate)

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(sentry::ClientOptions {
    dsn: std::env::var("SENTRY_DSN").ok().and_then(|s| s.parse().ok()),
    release: Some(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION").into()),
    environment: Some("production".into()),
    send_default_pii: false,
    before_send: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|mut event| {
        if let Some(user) = event.user.as_mut() {
            user.email = None; // scrub
        }
        Some(event)
    })),
    ..Default::default()
});
// sentry::integrations::panic forwards panics automatically once the guard is alive.
```

---

## Capturing Handled Exceptions Deliberately

Crash reporters aren't only for *un*handled failures. The "this shouldn't happen but I survived it" case is valuable too — but it's the easiest way to flood your dashboard if done carelessly.

```python
try:
    result = parse_third_party_response(resp)
except SchemaError as e:
    # We have a fallback, so we don't crash. But we WANT to know it happened.
    capture_exception(e)        # report
    result = fallback()          # recover
```

Guardrails for handled captures:

- **Give them a stable fingerprint** so they group cleanly (they often share a generic call site).
- **Sample them** if they're frequent — you don't need every occurrence (see `senior.md`).
- **Never capture routine errors** — a 404, a validation failure, an expected timeout. Those are metrics/logs. Capturing them buries real crashes.
- **Capture, then recover or re-raise — never capture-and-swallow blindly.** Reporting is not handling.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1 — One Init Module, Imported First

```python
# observability.py — imported as the very first line of main
def init():
    sentry_sdk.init(dsn=..., release=..., before_send=scrub, ...)
```

Centralize init so DSN, release, and scrubbing live in one auditable place — not scattered, not duplicated, not divergent between services.

### Pattern 2 — Release From the Build, Never Typed

```bash
# CI injects the same value into the SDK AND the symbol upload
RELEASE="myapp@$(cat VERSION)+$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```

The SDK's `release` and the symbol upload's `--release` must come from *one* source of truth, or symbols silently won't apply.

### Pattern 3 — Scrub Allowlist, Not Just Denylist

```python
SAFE_USER_KEYS = {"id", "plan", "segment"}
event["user"] = {k: v for k, v in event["user"].items() if k in SAFE_USER_KEYS}
```

Denylists ("strip email") miss the *next* sensitive field someone adds. An allowlist of *what may pass* is safer by default.

### Pattern 4 — Stable, Composed Fingerprints

```go
scope.SetFingerprint([]string{subsystem, errType, logicalOp}) // never include IDs
```

Compose fingerprints from *stable categorical* parts. Same bug → same key; different bug → different key; no per-request entropy.

### Pattern 5 — Describe, Don't Reveal, in Breadcrumbs

```js
addBreadcrumb({ message: "coupon applied", data: { length: code.length } }); // not the code
```

Breadcrumb `data` should let you *understand* the event without *exposing* the value.

---

## Clean Code

- **Initialize the reporter in exactly one place**, imported first, configured from env. No scattered `Sentry.init` calls.
- **Wire `release` and symbol upload from the same source** so they can never drift.
- **Make symbol upload a hard-gated CI step** — build fails if symbols didn't upload.
- **Scrub with an allowlist** for structured objects (user, context), plus regex denylist for free text (messages).
- **Set `sendDefaultPii: false`** and consciously add back only the safe context you need.
- **Override fingerprints where the default is wrong**, with stable categorical keys — and *only* where it's wrong; don't pre-optimize grouping.
- **Don't capture routine errors.** A reporter full of 404s is a reporter no one reads.
- **Verify, don't assume:** a CI smoke test that emits a crash with a fake PII payload and asserts it lands symbolicated and redacted.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Match the SDK `release` to the uploaded-symbol release, exactly.** This is the #1 cause of "symbols uploaded but traces still minified."
2. **Automate symbol upload in CI and fail the build if it fails.** Never rely on memory.
3. **Audit default grouping per project.** Find the under-grouped (dynamic message) and over-grouped (generic frame) cases and fix their fingerprints.
4. **Add breadcrumbs at network and navigation boundaries** — they're where the precondition usually hides.
5. **Scrub in `beforeSend` *and* enable server-side scrubbers.** Defense in depth.
6. **Use hashed user IDs** to get affected-user counts without storing identity.
7. **Test the scrubber** with a synthetic event containing fake secrets; confirm redaction end-to-end.
8. **Tag with feature flags / experiment variants** so you can correlate a crash with a rollout.
9. **Keep `environment` accurate** so staging noise doesn't pollute production issues.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Release-name mismatch** between SDK and symbol upload → symbols exist, never applied, traces stay minified. Single source of truth.
- **Source maps served publicly** → you've shipped your source. Upload to the reporter, strip from the deploy.
- **`beforeSend` throws** → some SDKs drop the event silently; keep the hook simple and defensive.
- **Auto HTTP breadcrumbs leak tokens** in query strings/headers → scrub in `beforeBreadcrumb`.
- **Over-grouping hides a regression** — a new bug folds into an existing issue and you never notice it's new. Watch for event-rate changes within an issue, not just new issues.
- **Hashing user IDs inconsistently** across services → the same user counts as several. Hash with a shared, stable scheme.
- **Sampling applied to crashes by accident** (confusing perf-trace sampling with error sampling) → you lose crashes. Keep error capture at 1.0 unless deliberately sampling (`senior.md`).
- **Mobile symbol upload tied to local builds only** → CI release builds ship with no symbols. Put the plugin in the *release* build path.
- **Breadcrumb buffer too small/large** → too small loses the smoking gun; too large bloats payloads and PII surface. Tune to your flows.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Uploading symbols under a release name that doesn't match the SDK's.** The most common middle-level failure; traces stay gibberish despite "successful" uploads.
2. **Leaving symbol upload as a manual step.** It gets skipped exactly on the urgent hotfix.
3. **Never touching default grouping**, then complaining the dashboard is noisy. Fingerprints are the fix.
4. **Putting IDs/timestamps into fingerprints**, shattering one bug into thousands of issues.
5. **Shipping `.map` files to the CDN**, exposing source.
6. **Attaching the full user object** (email, name) "to know who's affected," creating a PII liability. Use a hashed ID + plan.
7. **Auto-recorded HTTP breadcrumbs leaking auth tokens** because no one scrubbed `beforeBreadcrumb`.
8. **Capturing every handled error** (404s, validation) at full volume, burying real crashes.
9. **Trusting client-side scrubbing alone**, with no server-side scrubbers as backstop.
10. **Not testing the pipeline** — assuming the SDK "just works" and discovering at incident time that symbols never uploaded.

---

## Tricky Points

1. **Grouping depends on symbolication.** Group on minified frames and every new build re-shatters issues. Fix symbols *before* tuning fingerprints.
2. **`beforeSend` returning `null` drops the event entirely** — a powerful way to filter noise, but easy to over-drop and lose real crashes. Be conservative.
3. **Tags vs context is not cosmetic.** Tags are indexed (filter/group by them); context is just attached. Put anything you'll *slice by* in tags.
4. **`sendDefaultPii: false` also removes things you might want** (request data, IP). You re-add the *safe* subset deliberately — it's a default-deny posture.
5. **Crashlytics and Sentry handler chaining:** on Android both want to be the uncaught handler. They cooperate by chaining to the previous handler — don't install a third that breaks the chain.
6. **A "handled" capture still costs quota and dashboard space.** It's not free just because the app survived. Fingerprint and sample it.
7. **Source maps must match URL layout** (`--url-prefix`). If served paths don't match uploaded paths, resolution silently fails even with correct release.
8. **Regex scrubbing is lossy and fragile** — a card number split across a message won't match. Not-collecting beats scrubbing; scrubbing is the net, not the wall.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Crash Reporting** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Crash Reporting?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
