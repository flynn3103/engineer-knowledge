# Preventing Accumulation — Senior

> **Roadmap:** [Technical Debt Management](../README.md) → Preventing Accumulation
> *The middle page taught you to gate code-level debt — coverage thresholds, lint, a Definition of Done. This page is about the debt that gates can't see: the slow drift of the architecture-as-built away from the architecture-as-intended. You'll learn to encode architectural intent as executable tests, design the paved path so the clean way is the easy way, and recognize exactly where automation stops and judgment must start.*

## Introduction

> Focus: **Preventing the debt that compounds fastest and pays down slowest — architectural drift — by making intent executable and the clean path the path of least resistance.**

By the middle level you can stop bad *code* at the door: a Definition of Done, a coverage gate, a linter, a review checklist. Those work because code-level debt is local and legible — a long method, a missing test, a duplicated block all sit in one diff a reviewer can see. The senior problem is the debt that no single diff reveals. A UI module imports a persistence class. A "temporary" call from the billing service into the orders database hardens into a load-bearing coupling. A latency budget erodes ten milliseconds per quarter. Every one of those changes passes lint, passes review, passes coverage — and the system's *structure* degrades anyway, one defensible local decision at a time.

This is **architectural erosion**, and it is the most expensive debt there is, because the interest rate rises with the size of the blast radius. A tangled method costs one engineer an afternoon. A layering violation that has metastasized across two hundred files costs a team a quarter and is usually declared "too risky to touch." You cannot review your way out of it, because no reviewer holds the whole graph in their head, and the violating commit always looks reasonable in isolation.

The senior move is to stop relying on human vigilance for properties that machines can check, and to redirect that vigilance to the properties only humans can judge. You encode architectural intent — layering rules, allowed-dependency graphs, performance and size budgets — as **fitness functions** that run in CI and fail the build on drift. You design the **paved path** so that doing the right thing is the line of least resistance. And you reserve human review for the decisions automation genuinely can't make: whether an abstraction is the right one, whether this is the moment to take on debt deliberately, whether the design fits the problem. This page is that layer — preventing debt at the level of structure, not just syntax.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You've internalized [middle.md](middle.md) — Definition of Done, code review, quality gates, the broken-windows model, the difference between preventing and paying down.
- **Required:** You understand layered/hexagonal architecture and dependency direction — why the domain must not depend on the database, and what "depend on" means at the module level.
- **Helpful:** You've felt erosion firsthand: a codebase whose stated architecture and actual import graph had quietly diverged, and the cost of pulling them back together.
- **Helpful:** A working model of CI gates from Quality Gates — what it means to *fail the build*, and the politics of doing so.

## Architectural Erosion — The Debt Gates Don't Catch

Every system has two architectures. The **architecture-as-intended** is the one in the diagram, the ADR, the onboarding doc: domain doesn't know about the web, services own their data, this module is the only one allowed to talk to the payment provider. The **architecture-as-built** is whatever the import graph, the call graph, and the deployment topology actually say. The day those two agree, the system is healthy. They never stay agreed on their own.

Erosion is the gap widening. It is **structural** debt, and it has three properties that make it uniquely dangerous and uniquely invisible to ordinary gates:

- **It accumulates below the resolution of a diff.** A reviewer sees `import com.acme.billing.PaymentGateway` added to a file in the `orders` package and has no reason to object — the line is correct, the feature works. Only against the *whole graph* is it a violation: orders was never supposed to reach into billing's internals. No line-level reviewer holds the graph.
- **Its interest compounds with reach.** The cost of a violation is proportional to how many other things now depend on the wrong thing. One illegal edge is free to fix today and a quarter-long migration in two years, because in between, twenty more things were built on top of it. Erosion is the debt where *delay* is the dominant cost multiplier.
- **It is locally rational every step.** Nobody wakes up wanting to couple the layers. They want to ship the feature, and the shortest path crosses a boundary. The architecture loses not to malice or ignorance but to a thousand reasonable deadlines.

The classic failure shape is the **layered architecture that has quietly become a big ball of mud**. The diagram still shows UI → service → repository → database, clean and one-directional. The reality is that the UI reaches straight into repositories to "avoid an unnecessary service call," the repository imports a UI formatting helper "just for this one date," and a cycle has formed between three packages that the diagram swears are layers. The architecture-as-intended is fiction; the architecture-as-built is a graph with no enforceable direction left.

> **Key insight:** Erosion is not a code-quality problem — it's a *conformance* problem. The question is never "is this code good?" but "does the system-as-built still match the system-as-intended?" That reframing is the whole game: the moment intent is written down precisely enough to be checked, you can check it *automatically*, on every commit, before the gap has time to compound. The rest of this page is mechanisms for doing exactly that.

## Fitness Functions — Encoding Intent as Executable Tests

The term comes from *Building Evolutionary Architecture* (Ford, Parsons, Kua). An **architectural fitness function** is an objective, automated check that some characteristic of the system holds — the architectural analog of a unit test. A unit test guards *behavior* ("`add(2,2)` returns `4`"); a fitness function guards a *structural or operational property* ("the domain package never imports the web package," "p99 latency stays under 200 ms," "the deployable image stays under 250 MB"). The premise of evolutionary architecture is that you cannot freeze a system to protect its design, so instead you make the design's invariants *executable* and let them fail the build the instant a change violates them.

The most important class for preventing structural debt is the **dependency rule** — a test that the allowed-dependency graph is respected. On the JVM the canonical tool is **ArchUnit**, which lets you write architecture rules as ordinary JUnit tests:

```java
// Layering: the domain must not depend on infrastructure or the web.
@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "com.acme.shop")
class LayeringTest {

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule layered =
        layeredArchitecture().consideringOnlyDependenciesInLayers()
            .layer("Web").definedBy("..web..")
            .layer("Application").definedBy("..application..")
            .layer("Domain").definedBy("..domain..")
            .layer("Infrastructure").definedBy("..infrastructure..")

            .whereLayer("Web").mayNotBeAccessedByAnyLayer()
            .whereLayer("Application").mayOnlyBeAccessedByLayers("Web")
            .whereLayer("Domain").mayOnlyBeAccessedByLayers("Application", "Infrastructure")
            .whereLayer("Infrastructure").mayNotBeAccessedByAnyLayer();

    // The single most valuable architectural test you can write:
    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule noCycles =
        slices().matching("com.acme.shop.(*)..").should().beFreeOfCycles();

    // Hexagonal purity: the domain depends on nothing framework-shaped.
    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule domainIsPure =
        noClasses().that().resideInAPackage("..domain..")
            .should().dependOnClassesThat()
            .resideInAnyPackage("..infrastructure..", "org.springframework..", "javax.persistence..");
}
```

That `noCycles` rule is worth singling out. Package cycles are the molecular bond of a big ball of mud — once package A depends on B and B on A, neither can be understood, tested, or extracted independently, and the cycle silently recruits more members over time. A free-of-cycles fitness function catches the *first* illegal edge, when removing it is a one-line change, instead of the hundredth, when it's a refactoring project.

For the JavaScript/TypeScript world, **dependency-cruiser** plays the same role, expressing the allowed graph as `forbidden` rules in config:

```javascript
// .dependency-cruiser.js
module.exports = {
  forbidden: [
    {
      name: 'no-domain-to-infra',
      severity: 'error',
      comment: 'Domain logic must not import infrastructure adapters.',
      from: { path: '^src/domain' },
      to:   { path: '^src/infrastructure' },
    },
    {
      name: 'no-circular',
      severity: 'error',
      comment: 'Circular dependencies are the seed of a ball of mud.',
      from: {},
      to:   { circular: true },
    },
    {
      name: 'ui-leaf',
      severity: 'error',
      comment: 'UI components are leaves — nothing else may import them.',
      from: { pathNot: '^src/ui' },
      to:   { path: '^src/ui' },
    },
  ],
};
```

```bash
depcruise --config .dependency-cruiser.js src   # fails CI on any forbidden edge
depcruise --output-type dot src | dot -Tsvg > deps.svg   # render the actual graph
```

The same idea exists in nearly every ecosystem: **import-linter** and **Tach** in Python, **NetArchTest** / **ArchUnitNET** in .NET, Go's own internal-package mechanism plus tools like `go-arch-lint`, and Gradle/Bazel **`visibility`** declarations that make a target's API a *build-enforced* boundary rather than a documented convention. The tool is incidental; the discipline is what matters: **the allowed-dependency graph is written down once, as code, and the build refuses to let reality diverge from it.**

Dependency rules are the headline, but fitness functions cover any objective property:

- **Performance budgets as drift guards.** A test that asserts p99 latency for a critical endpoint stays under a threshold, run against a representative load in CI, catches the slow erosion of performance the same way the layering rule catches structural erosion. The budget is the line; crossing it fails the build.
- **Size/weight budgets.** A front-end **bundle-size budget** (`bundlesize`, or webpack's `performance.maxAssetSize`) that fails the build if the main chunk crosses, say, 200 KB gzipped, stops the death-by-a-thousand-imports that bloats a web app. The container-image analog caps the deployable artifact.
- **Public-API surface.** A test that the set of exported symbols only *grows* with intent (snapshot the public API; fail if it changes without an accompanying review) prevents the accidental-export problem — every leaked internal becomes a permanent compatibility obligation.

Ford's taxonomy is worth carrying: fitness functions are **atomic** (one check, e.g. a single layering rule) vs **holistic** (an emergent property under load); **triggered** (run in CI on a commit) vs **continuous** (monitored in production, e.g. an SLO that doubles as a fitness function); and **static** (a fixed threshold) vs **dynamic** (a budget that shifts with context). Most of your debt-prevention value is in *atomic, triggered, static* functions — the cheap, fast, deterministic ones that live next to your unit tests and fail fast.

> **Key insight:** A fitness function turns an architectural *opinion* ("the domain should be pure") into an architectural *fact the build enforces*. Opinions erode under deadline pressure because the reviewer who held the opinion is out that week; facts don't, because the build doesn't get tired, doesn't approve to be nice, and checks the *whole graph* on *every* commit. Anything about your structure you can state precisely, you can defend automatically — and a defended invariant stays true for years at zero ongoing cost.

---

## Conformance Checking — Built vs Intended

A fitness function enforces a *rule*; **conformance checking** asks the broader question of how far the architecture-as-built has already drifted from the architecture-as-intended, and where. The two are complementary: fitness functions are the *guard rail* that prevents new drift; conformance checking is the *survey* that tells you how much drift already exists and is worth a guard rail.

The mature technique is **reflexion modeling** (Murphy, Notkin, Sullivan). You state a small high-level model of intended modules and allowed relations, you let a tool extract the *actual* dependency graph from source, and the tool maps source onto your model and classifies every edge:

- **Convergence** — an edge that exists and is allowed. Good; the reality matches the intent.
- **Divergence** — an edge that exists but is *not* allowed. This is erosion made visible: the UI reaching into the repository, the cycle between "layers."
- **Absence** — an edge the model expects but reality lacks. Often a sign the intended design was never actually built, or has rotted away.

```
INTENDED                          ACTUAL (extracted from imports)
  ┌──────┐                          ┌──────┐
  │  UI  │                          │  UI  │──────────┐
  └──┬───┘                          └──┬───┘          │ DIVERGENCE
     │ allowed                         │              │ (UI → Repo,
     ▼                                 ▼              ▼  not allowed)
  ┌──────┐                          ┌──────┐      ┌──────┐
  │Service│                         │Service│◄────│ Repo │ DIVERGENCE
  └──┬───┘                          └──┬───┘ │    └──────┘ (cycle!)
     │ allowed                         │     │ DIVERGENCE
     ▼                                 ▼     └──────────
  ┌──────┐                          ┌──────┐
  │ Repo │                          │ Repo │
  └──────┘                          └──────┘
```

The output is a punch list ranked by how load-bearing each divergent edge has become — exactly the input you need to decide which violations to fix now and which to wrap in a fitness function so they at least stop *growing*. Tools that do this in practice include **Structure101**, **Sonargraph**, **NDepend** (.NET), **ArchUnit/dependency-cruiser** themselves run in report mode, and SonarQube's architecture views. The point is not the tool; it's the loop: **extract reality, compare to intent, classify the gap, act on the divergences, then encode the now-true intent as a fitness function so it can't re-diverge.**

There's a deeper structural principle underneath conformance checking: **make the wrong thing hard to express in the first place.** The strongest boundary is not a test that fails when you cross it but a structure where crossing is *not possible*. Language and build mechanisms give you this:

- **Module/package visibility** — Java modules (JPMS) that simply don't `exports` an internal package; Go's `internal/` directory, which the *compiler* refuses to let external packages import; Bazel/Gradle `visibility` lists that fail the build at the dependency, not in a separate test. These make divergence a compile error, the earliest and cheapest possible failure.
- **Physical separation** — putting the domain in a module with *no dependency* on the persistence module in the build graph, so a `domain → infrastructure` import literally won't compile because the symbol isn't on the classpath. The dependency rule is enforced by *absence*, which no deadline can route around.

> **Key insight:** A fitness function tells you when someone crossed a boundary; a well-placed module boundary means there was no door to cross. Prefer making the wrong thing *impossible* (compile error via visibility/separation) over making it *detected* (a test that fails after the fact) over making it *discouraged* (a comment that says "please don't"). The further left you push enforcement — from convention, to test, to compiler — the cheaper and more durable the prevention.

## Clean as You Code — The Quality-Leak Model

The instinct, faced with a debt-laden codebase, is to launch a cleanup project: freeze features, fix everything, declare victory. It almost always fails — it's unfundable, it's risky, and it touches code that didn't need touching. **Clean as You Code** (the model SonarQube made popular) inverts the strategy with a single, powerful constraint: *stop trying to fix the whole codebase; instead, hold an absolute quality bar on the code you are changing right now, and let the codebase heal through normal churn.*

The mechanism rests on splitting the codebase along a time axis:

- **New code** — code added or changed in the current change set / since a fixed reference (a release, a date, the branch point). This is the **leak period**, and the gate applies here in full force: zero new issues above your severity bar, coverage on new lines at or above target, no new code smells, complexity within limits. The gate is on the *new code quality*, not the project total.
- **Old code** — everything else. You do *not* gate it, you do *not* mass-rewrite it. You leave it alone until a feature or a bug brings you into it — at which point it becomes "code you are changing right now," and the new-code gate applies to your edits.

The model is named for the leak it stops. Picture the codebase as a vessel and incoming debt as water: a project-wide threshold ("keep total debt under X") is like bailing — exhausting, never-finished, and the level rises faster than any team can scoop. Gating the **leak period** is like *patching the hole*: you stop new water entering, and then you deal with the standing water deliberately, where it actually hurts. Empirically, the bulk of a project's debt is introduced in a small, recent slice of its lifetime; gate that slice and you've addressed most of the *flow* without touching the *stock*.

Why does the *stock* take care of itself? Because of where code actually changes. Software change is intensely **non-uniform** — a small set of files (the **hotspots**: high churn × high complexity, the heart of [02 — Identifying & Quantifying](../02-identifying-and-quantifying/senior.md)) absorbs most of the edits, while the long tail of files is touched once a year or never. Clean-as-you-code exploits this directly:

- **Hotspots get cleaned automatically.** The files you change constantly are exactly the files the new-code gate keeps forcing you to improve. The debt with the highest *interest rate* — debt you pay on every single change — is precisely the debt that churn drives you back into, so it retires fastest. This is the same insight as "don't fix debt you never touch" from [04 — Tracking & Prioritizing](../04-tracking-and-prioritizing/senior.md), turned into an automatic policy.
- **The cold tail is left alone — correctly.** A complex, ugly file that nobody has touched in three years has, by definition, an interest rate near zero: its ugliness costs you nothing because you never read it. Spending sprint capacity to "clean it up" is paying down principal on a zero-interest loan while the high-interest hotspots keep charging you. Clean-as-you-code's refusal to gate cold code is not laziness; it's correct prioritization.

In CI this is one configuration choice — point the quality gate at *new code* rather than *overall*:

```yaml
# SonarQube quality gate (conceptual): all conditions scoped to NEW code.
qualityGate:
  conditions:
    - metric: new_coverage            # coverage on lines added/changed
      op: LESS_THAN
      threshold: 80
    - metric: new_blocker_violations  # zero new blocker-severity issues
      op: GREATER_THAN
      threshold: 0
    - metric: new_duplicated_lines_density
      op: GREATER_THAN
      threshold: 3
    - metric: new_maintainability_rating
      op: WORSE_THAN
      threshold: A
  # Crucially: NO condition on total coverage or total issues.
  # The bar is on the leak, not the lake.
```

> **Key insight:** You don't pay down a large codebase's debt by attacking the *stock*; you stop the *flow* and let *churn* retire the high-interest stock for you. Gate new code absolutely, leave cold code alone, and the hotspots — the only debt that's actually costing you — get cleaned every time you're forced back into them. This is the rare prevention strategy that is *more* effective the less heroic effort you spend, because it aligns cleanup with where change already happens.

## The Paved Path — Making the Clean Way the Easy Way

Every prevention mechanism so far is, at bottom, a *no*: the gate says no, the fitness function fails, the boundary won't compile. Negative controls are necessary but insufficient, because they fight the gradient — under deadline pressure the engineer is pushing toward "ship it," and you're pushing back. A far more durable strategy works *with* the gradient: make the clean, correct way also the **easiest** way, so the line of least resistance and the line of best practice are the same line. This is the **paved path** (Netflix's term) or **golden path** (the Spotify/Google framing): an opinionated, well-supported, well-documented default route through which you build the common thing.

The economic logic is simple and ruthless. Engineers are not, in aggregate, choosing badly out of carelessness; they're choosing the path of least resistance under time pressure. If the clean architecture requires hand-wiring six concerns — config, logging, metrics, auth, a health check, a CI pipeline — and the dirty shortcut requires none, the shortcut *will* win often enough to erode you, no matter how many gates you add. Flip the cost: make the clean way a single command, and now the *clean* way is the lazy way. You haven't out-disciplined human nature; you've re-routed it.

Concretely, a paved path is built from a few compounding mechanisms:

- **Scaffolds and templates.** A `create-new-service` generator (Backstage software templates, a Cookiecutter/Yeoman/`nx generate` template, an internal CLI) that produces a new service *already* wired with the layered package structure, structured logging, metrics, health checks, a Dockerfile that follows the org's hardening rules, and a CI pipeline that includes the fitness functions. The first commit is already conformant — drift has to be *added*, it isn't the default.
- **Well-factored shared libraries.** A blessed HTTP client that already does retries, timeouts, circuit breaking, and tracing; a config library that fails fast on a missing key; a persistence base that enforces the repository pattern. The clean way to make an outbound call is to use the library, which is *less* code than rolling your own — so the good default is the lazy default. (This is where the discipline meets the DRY principle — but as *factored*, blessed reuse, not copy-paste.)
- **Good defaults baked into the platform.** A base CI template, a base service image, a base Terraform module — inherited, not authored. The engineer gets W^X-style "secure and conformant unless you go out of your way" behavior for free.

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TWO PATHS TO A NEW SERVICE                                  │

│       (more work, easy to get wrong)                        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The paved path is not a cage. Its companion principle is **"easy to do the right thing, possible to do the right-different thing"** — you keep the off-road route open for the genuinely novel case, but you make sure it's *visibly* off-road (it doesn't inherit the platform defaults, it requires a conscious choice and usually a review). Teams that pave *and* allow deliberate deviation keep both their consistency and their ability to innovate; teams that mandate the path with no exit breed shadow infrastructure that's worse than what they banned.

> **Key insight:** Gates fight the gradient of least resistance; the paved path *redirects* it. You will never win a sustained fight against "ship the easy way" with negative controls alone — but if you make the clean way the easy way, the same human tendency that used to cause drift now prevents it. The best prevention is the kind nobody has to choose, because the default is already right and choosing otherwise is the extra work.

## Dependency and Version Debt — Keeping the Floor Moving

There is a category of debt that accumulates with *zero* code changes on your side: **dependency debt**. Your dependencies ship new versions; you don't upgrade; the gap between the version you're on and the current version widens every day you do nothing. This is debt by *inaction*, and it has a vicious nonlinearity — the cost of upgrading does not grow linearly with how far behind you are, it grows *super-linearly*, because the upgrade path crosses more breaking changes, more deprecations, and more transitive churn the longer you wait. The library you could have bumped through one minor version painlessly becomes a four-major-version migration, and the security patch you now urgently need is only available on a version you can no longer reach without a project.

The strategic frame is **keeping the floor moving**. Treat "current minus one or two minor versions" as the floor you stand on, and keep that floor rising continuously, so the distance you ever have to jump in an emergency stays small. A team that's never more than a few weeks behind can absorb a critical CVE patch in an afternoon; a team three years behind cannot patch at all without a migration, which means they ship the vulnerability.

The mechanism is **automated dependency updates**, and the modern tools are **Renovate** and **Dependabot**. They watch your manifests, open a pull request per update (or batched), attach changelogs and release notes, and — critically — *run your test suite and fitness functions against the bump*. The upgrade becomes a steady stream of small, individually reviewable, automatically-tested PRs instead of a periodic terrifying leap:

```json
// renovate.json — a sane, automation-forward policy
{
  "extends": ["config:recommended"],
  "schedule": ["before 9am on monday"],
  "packageRules": [
    {
      "description": "Auto-merge low-risk updates once CI (incl. fitness functions) is green",
      "matchUpdateTypes": ["minor", "patch"],
      "matchCurrentVersion": "!/^0/",
      "automerge": true
    },
    {
      "description": "Security fixes jump the queue",
      "matchDepTypes": ["dependencies"],
      "vulnerabilityAlerts": { "labels": ["security"], "automerge": true }
    },
    {
      "description": "Batch dev-tooling to keep PR noise down",
      "matchDepTypes": ["devDependencies"],
      "groupName": "dev tooling"
    }
  ],
  "lockFileMaintenance": { "enabled": true, "automerge": true }
}
```

The payoff is the compounding of two things you already built. Because your test suite *and your fitness functions* run on every bump, **auto-merging minor and patch updates is safe** — if a dependency upgrade silently breaks behavior or violates an architectural rule, the build catches it and the PR doesn't merge. The same gates that prevent *your* drift now let you absorb *the ecosystem's* churn without manual toil. This is the precise point where dependency hygiene and the fitness-function discipline reinforce each other: strong gates are what make aggressive auto-upgrading responsible rather than reckless.

> **Key insight:** Dependency debt is the only debt that grows while you do nothing, and its cost is super-linear in how long you ignore it — so the dominant variable is *frequency of upgrade*, not effort per upgrade. Automate the bumps, keep the floor a week or two behind HEAD, and let your existing test-and-fitness gates make auto-merge safe. The goal is never "fully up to date"; it's "never so far behind that the next security patch requires a migration."

## Knowledge Debt — Bus Factor and Context Spread

The last category is the one no tool flags and no gate catches: **knowledge debt**. It's the *why* that never got written down. The reason the retry count is exactly three, the off-by-one that one engineer fixed and understands, the architectural decision that looks arbitrary until you know the constraint it was solving — all of it living in one or two people's heads. The system runs fine. The debt is invisible *until that person is on vacation, or leaves*, and a routine change becomes archaeology because nobody left a map. **Bus factor** is the blunt name: how many people can be hit by a bus before the knowledge to operate or evolve a critical part of the system is gone.

Knowledge debt is insidious because it's *negatively* correlated with the symptoms you'd notice. A system with terrible bus factor often looks the healthiest — it ships fast and runs clean — precisely because the one expert who understands it is carrying it. The debt is hidden by the very competence that created it, and it comes due at the worst possible time, with no warning, when that competence walks out the door.

The mechanisms that prevent it are about **spreading context** before it concentrates, and they're cultural-with-tooling rather than gate-shaped:

- **ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).** A short, immutable record per significant decision: the context, the decision, the alternatives considered, and the consequences. ADRs capture the *why* that diagrams and code can't — the constraint, the trade-off, the road not taken. Six months later, when someone asks "why is this coupled this way," the answer is a file in the repo, not a Slack search for an engineer who's since left. ADRs are the antidote to "we don't know why this is here, so we're afraid to change it" — the fear that freezes architectures and the reason erosion goes unfixed.
- **Docs-as-code.** Documentation that lives in the repository next to the code, reviewed in the same PR, versioned with the same history, and *checked by the same CI* (dead-link checks, doc linters, even doc-generation from code). When docs ride in the PR, they update with the code instead of rotting beside it — and stale docs are arguably worse than none, because they actively mislead. This is the Code Craft → Documentation discipline applied as a debt-prevention control.
- **Pairing and review as context-spread, not just defect-catch.** The deepest value of pair programming and code review is not the bugs they catch — it's the second person who now understands the code. Treat review explicitly as a knowledge-distribution mechanism: rotate reviewers so context spreads beyond the original author, require a reviewer who *isn't* the local expert when touching a single-owner module, and use review comments to ask "why," capturing the answer where it persists.

A simple, durable metric makes this debt visible: **truck-factor / bus-factor analysis** over `git blame` — for each critical module, how many distinct authors hold the bulk of the knowledge? A module owned 95% by one author is a bus-factor-of-one risk register entry, surfaced *before* the bus, and an explicit signal to pair, document, and rotate review on it.

> **Key insight:** Knowledge debt is the debt your monitoring is structurally blind to, because the system performs *best* right up until the expert leaves — competence masks the risk. Prevent it by treating ADRs, docs-as-code, and review-as-context-spread as first-class debt controls, not nice-to-haves, and by measuring bus factor so single-owner hotspots are visible while they're still cheap to de-risk. You can't lint for "only one person understands this," so you have to *design the culture* that spreads understanding.

## The Limits of Gates — You Can't Lint Your Way to Good Design

Everything above is mechanism, and mechanism has a hard ceiling that a senior engineer must respect, or the whole apparatus curdles into theater. **Automated gates can enforce properties; they cannot supply judgment.** A fitness function can prove the domain doesn't import the database. It cannot tell you whether the domain model is *right* — whether the aggregate boundaries match the business, whether the abstraction earns its complexity, whether this is the rare moment to take on debt *deliberately* and prudently (the top-left of [the debt quadrant](../03-the-debt-quadrant/senior.md)). Those are the decisions that actually determine whether a design is good, and they are exactly the ones no rule can make.

The failure modes of forgetting this are specific and worth naming:

- **Goodhart's law on gates.** When a measure becomes a target, it stops measuring what it meant to. Mandate 90% coverage and you get tests that execute lines and assert nothing; mandate "no functions over 30 lines" and you get one 30-line function split into three 10-line functions that are *harder* to follow than the original. The gate is now satisfied and the thing it stood for is worse. A green gate is a *necessary* condition for quality, never a *sufficient* one.
- **Gates can't catch the right wrong thing.** A perfectly layered, cycle-free, fully-covered system can still be the wrong architecture for the problem — a microservice split along the wrong seams, an abstraction that fits last year's requirements. Every fitness function passes; the design is still bad. Conformance to *stated* intent is worthless if the intent itself was wrong, and no gate can evaluate the intent.
- **Over-gating breeds avoidance.** A gate that fires constantly with low signal — flaky perf budgets, an over-strict lint rule, a fitness function nobody believes — trains engineers to disable, bypass, or `// nolint` their way around *all* gates, including the ones that matter. Each gate spends trust; spend it on rules that are precise, fast, and almost never wrong, or you'll have no trust left for the rule that finally catches something real.

So the senior posture is **a clean division of labor**: let machines guard everything objective — layering, cycles, coverage on new code, budgets, dependency freshness — so that *human attention is freed for the things only humans can judge*. Review should not be spending its scarce minutes counting line lengths or checking import directions; the build already did that, perfectly, on every commit. Review should be spending those minutes on the questions the build *can't* ask: is this the right abstraction? does this model the domain faithfully? are we taking on this debt deliberately and is that the right call? is the design *good*? Gates exist to make the cheap-to-check failures impossible, precisely so that expensive human judgment is reserved for the failures that require it.

> **Key insight:** The point of automating every objective check is *not* to remove human judgment from the loop — it's to *concentrate* it where it's irreplaceable. You can't lint your way to good design, but you can lint away everything that *isn't* design, so the design conversation is the only conversation review has left to have. A team that gates the objective and reviews the subjective gets both: invariants that hold for free, and human attention spent only where it actually moves the needle.

## Mental Models

- **Every system has two architectures, and they drift apart for free.** The architecture-as-intended (the diagram, the ADR) and the architecture-as-built (the import graph) agree only by active enforcement. Prevention *is* keeping them in agreement — fitness functions are the enforcement, conformance checking is the survey of how far they've already diverged.

- **A fitness function is a unit test for structure.** Unit tests guard behavior; fitness functions guard properties — layering, acyclicity, latency budgets, bundle size. Anything you can state precisely about your architecture, you can defend automatically on every commit, at zero ongoing cost. An opinion erodes; an enforced fact doesn't.

- **Make the wrong thing impossible > detected > discouraged.** A compile error (module visibility, physical separation) beats a failing test, which beats a comment that says "please don't." Push enforcement as far left as the language allows — the earliest failure is the cheapest and the hardest to route around under deadline.

- **Stop the flow, not the stock.** Clean-as-you-code gates *new* code absolutely and leaves cold code alone; churn then retires the high-interest hotspots automatically, because the debt you keep paying on is the debt you keep being forced back into. The prevention that works is the one aligned with where change already happens.

- **Redirect the gradient, don't fight it.** Gates fight the engineer's pull toward the easy path; the paved path makes the clean path *be* the easy path. You won't out-discipline human nature indefinitely — but you can re-route it so the lazy choice is also the right one.

- **Gates handle the objective so humans can handle the subjective.** Automation's job is to make cheap-to-check failures impossible, freeing scarce human judgment for the questions no rule can answer: is this the right abstraction, the right model, the right deliberate debt? You can't lint your way to good design — but you can lint away everything that isn't design.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Relying on review to catch architectural drift.** No line-level reviewer holds the whole import graph, and every violating commit looks reasonable in isolation. Layering and cycle rules belong in a fitness function (ArchUnit, dependency-cruiser) that checks the *graph* on every commit — not in a human's tired attention.

2. **Launching a big-bang debt cleanup instead of stopping the leak.** Project-wide remediation is unfundable, risky, and touches code that didn't need touching. Gate *new code* (clean-as-you-code), leave cold code alone, and let churn retire the hotspots — the debt that's actually costing you.

3. **Cleaning cold code while hotspots keep charging interest.** A complex file untouched for three years has a near-zero interest rate; rewriting it is paying down a zero-interest loan. Spend cleanup effort where churn × complexity is high, not where the code merely *looks* worst.

4. **Building only negative controls.** Gates alone fight the gradient of least resistance and lose under deadline pressure. Without a paved path that makes the clean way the *easy* way (scaffolds, blessed libraries, good defaults), drift returns no matter how many rules you add.

5. **Letting the dependency floor freeze.** "We'll upgrade when we need to" guarantees that when you *need* a security patch, you can't reach it without a migration. Automate bumps (Renovate/Dependabot), auto-merge minor/patch behind green CI, and keep the floor a week or two behind HEAD.

6. **Treating ADRs and docs as optional.** Knowledge debt is invisible until the one person who understands a module leaves. ADRs (the *why*), docs-as-code (reviewed in the same PR, checked by CI), and review-as-context-spread are debt controls, not paperwork — and bus-factor analysis surfaces single-owner risk before the bus.

7. **Mistaking a green gate for good design.** Coverage, layering, and budgets are *necessary, not sufficient*. A fully-conformant system can still be the wrong architecture. Reserve human review for what gates can't judge — abstraction fit, domain modeling, deliberate debt — and don't let Goodhart turn your thresholds into theater.

8. **Over-gating until engineers route around all gates.** A noisy, flaky, or low-signal gate trains people to bypass *every* gate. Each gate spends trust; keep only the precise, fast, almost-never-wrong ones, so trust survives for the rule that finally catches something real.

## Test Yourself

1. Why is architectural erosion invisible to ordinary code review and lint, when the same review reliably catches a long method or a missing test?
2. What is an architectural fitness function, and how does it relate to a unit test? Give two concrete examples that aren't dependency rules.
3. Write (in words or pseudo-rule) the single most valuable architectural test for preventing a big ball of mud, and explain why it's the highest-leverage one.
4. Explain the clean-as-you-code "quality leak" model. Why does it retire high-interest debt without a dedicated cleanup project, and why is leaving cold code alone *correct* rather than lazy?
5. Your team adds gate after gate and drift still creeps back under deadline pressure. What strategy works *with* the gradient of least resistance instead of against it, and what concretely is it made of?
6. Why does dependency debt cost super-linearly in how long you ignore it, and what makes auto-merging minor/patch upgrades *responsible* rather than reckless?
7. Name a category of debt that no fitness function or gate can catch, why it's masked by the system performing *well*, and three mechanisms that prevent it.
8. A perfectly layered, cycle-free, 95%-covered service is still the wrong design. Explain the limit of gates this illustrates, and what human review should therefore spend its attention on.

```
THE TWO ARCHITECTURES
  as-intended (diagram/ADR)  vs  as-built (import + call graph)
  they drift apart for FREE — prevention = keep them in agreement
  erosion: below diff resolution · compounds with reach · locally rational

FITNESS FUNCTIONS (unit tests for structure)
  JVM:    ArchUnit   layeredArchitecture()... / slices().should().beFreeOfCycles()
  JS/TS:  dependency-cruiser   forbidden: [{from, to, circular:true}]
  Py:     import-linter / Tach      .NET: NetArchTest / ArchUnitNET
  Go:     internal/ (compiler-enforced) · go-arch-lint
  budgets: p99 latency · bundle size (bundlesize) · image size · public-API surface
  Ford's axes: atomic|holistic · triggered|continuous · static|dynamic
  → highest-value: ATOMIC, TRIGGERED, STATIC (cheap, fast, next to unit tests)
  THE one rule to add first:  no package cycles

MAKE WRONG THING:  impossible  >  detected  >  discouraged

CONFORMANCE CHECKING (reflexion model)
  convergence (allowed+present) · divergence (present, NOT allowed) · absence
  tools: Structure101 / Sonargraph / NDepend / depcruise --output dot
  loop: extract reality → compare intent → act on divergence → encode as fitness fn

CLEAN AS YOU CODE  (stop the flow, not the stock)
  gate NEW code absolutely · leave COLD code alone · churn retires hotspots
  SonarQube: new_coverage, new_blocker_violations, new_maintainability_rating
  NO condition on total/overall — the bar is on the leak, not the lake

PAVED / GOLDEN PATH  (redirect the gradient)
  scaffolds (Backstage / cookiecutter / nx) → conformant by default
  blessed shared libs (HTTP client w/ retries+tracing) → clean way = less code
  good platform defaults inherited, not authored
  "easy to do right, possible to do right-different"

DEPENDENCY DEBT  (grows while you do nothing; super-linear cost)
  Renovate / Dependabot · auto-merge minor+patch behind GREEN ci
  keep floor ~1–2 versions behind HEAD · security PRs jump the queue
  gates make auto-upgrade SAFE

KNOWLEDGE DEBT  (no gate catches it; masked by good performance)
  ADRs (the why) · docs-as-code (same PR, CI-checked) · review = context-spread
  bus-factor over git blame → single-owner hotspots = risk register

LIMITS OF GATES
  necessary, NOT sufficient · Goodhart (measure→target→theater)
  gate the OBJECTIVE so review can judge the SUBJECTIVE (abstraction, model, design)
  over-gating → engineers route around ALL gates · spend trust carefully
```

## Summary

- Every system has an **architecture-as-intended** and an **architecture-as-built**, and they drift apart on their own. Architectural **erosion** is that gap widening — and it's invisible to ordinary review because it accumulates below the resolution of a diff, compounds with reach, and is locally rational at every step.
- **Fitness functions** are unit tests for structure: automated, objective checks that a property holds — layering and acyclicity rules (ArchUnit, dependency-cruiser), performance budgets, size budgets, public-API surface. They turn an architectural *opinion* into a *fact the build enforces*, on the whole graph, on every commit. The first rule to add is **no package cycles**.
- Prefer making the wrong thing **impossible** (compile-enforced visibility, physical module separation) over **detected** (a failing test) over **discouraged** (a comment). **Conformance checking** (reflexion modeling — convergence/divergence/absence) surveys how far you've already drifted and ranks what to fix.
- **Clean as you code** stops the *flow*, not the *stock*: gate new code absolutely, leave cold code alone, and let churn retire the high-interest hotspots automatically. It's the rare prevention strategy that works *better* with less heroic effort, because it aligns cleanup with where change already happens.
- The **paved path** redirects the gradient of least resistance instead of fighting it — scaffolds, blessed shared libraries, and good platform defaults make the clean way the *easy* way, so the lazy choice is the right one.
- **Dependency debt** grows while you do nothing and costs super-linearly in how long you wait; automate bumps (Renovate/Dependabot), keep the floor moving, and let your existing gates make auto-merge safe. **Knowledge debt** is invisible because the system performs best right until the expert leaves — prevent it with ADRs, docs-as-code, review-as-context-spread, and bus-factor analysis.
- Gates are **necessary, not sufficient**: you can't lint your way to good design. Automate every objective check precisely so that scarce human judgment is *concentrated* on what no rule can answer — abstraction fit, domain modeling, and whether a given debt is the right deliberate trade-off.

You now prevent debt at the level of *structure*, not just syntax — encoding intent as executable checks, paving the clean path, and drawing a clean line between what machines guard and what humans must judge. The next layer — [professional.md](professional.md) — is about operating this across an organization: funding it, holding the line politically, and keeping the gates trusted at scale.
