## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

**Diagrams as code** means you *write* a diagram as a few lines of plain text — a small markup language — and a tool **renders** it into a picture automatically. The text lives in your repository, next to the code it describes, and is reviewed, versioned, and regenerated exactly like source code.

> A **diagram as code** is a diagram defined in committed, human-readable text markup and rendered automatically — never a hand-placed binary image exported from a drawing tool.

Here is the entire idea in one block. This is real Mermaid source; on GitHub, GitLab, or an MkDocs site it renders as an actual picture:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User --> WebApp
    WebApp --> API
    API --> Database
```

Five lines of text. No mouse, no dragging boxes, no exporting a PNG. You committed *the recipe for the picture*, and the platform draws it for you. Change a line, and the picture changes — automatically, in the next render.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** comfort with **Markdown** and committing files to **Git** — diagrams-as-code lives in Markdown files in a repo.
- **Required:** you have opened a **pull request** and had code reviewed — the payoff is diffable, reviewable diagrams.
- **Helpful:** a rough mental picture of a typical web system (client, server/API, database) so the examples make sense.
- **Helpful:** exposure to [READMEs](../03-readmes-and-onboarding-docs/junior.md) and [code comments/docstrings](../02-code-comments-and-docstrings/junior.md) — diagrams usually live *inside* these.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Diagram as code** | A diagram written as plain-text markup, committed to the repo, and rendered automatically. |
| **Mermaid** | A text-to-diagram syntax that renders **natively** in GitHub, GitLab, and many doc tools — the easiest entry point. |
| **PlantUML** | An older, more complete text-to-diagram tool covering all UML diagram types; renders via a server or local jar. |
| **Graphviz / DOT** | A graph-layout engine; you describe nodes and edges in the `DOT` language and it auto-arranges them. |
| **Render** | Turn the text markup into an actual image (SVG/PNG) — done by the platform or in CI. |
| **Doc rot** | Documentation that has silently drifted out of sync with reality; a stale screenshot is the classic example. |
| **Diff** | The line-by-line change view in Git; text diagrams produce *readable* diffs, binary images do not. |
| **Single source of truth** | One authoritative place a fact lives; for a diagram, the committed markup — not a copy in someone's drawing tool. |

## The Problem: The Diagram That Rots

Picture the usual lifecycle of a diagram drawn the old way:

1. An engineer opens Lucidchart, draw.io, or Visio and drags boxes around for an hour.
2. They export a `architecture.png` and paste it into the wiki or README.
3. The system changes — a new service is added, a queue is introduced, a database is split.
4. **Nobody updates the picture.** Updating it means finding the original file, reopening the GUI tool, re-arranging, re-exporting, re-uploading.
5. Six months later the diagram confidently shows an architecture that no longer exists. A new hire trusts it and wastes a day.

This is **doc rot**, and the screenshot-of-a-whiteboard is its purest form — out of date the instant the marker stops moving. (Fighting rot is a whole topic on its own: [Keeping Docs Alive](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/junior.md).)

The root causes are all about *friction* and *invisibility*:

| Problem with binary-image diagrams | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Lives outside the repo (or as an opaque blob inside it) | Drifts from the code; nobody is reminded to update it |
| Editing needs a GUI tool and the original source file | High friction → people don't bother |
| A `.png` shows as "Binary file changed" in a PR | Can't be reviewed; no one catches a wrong arrow |
| Only the original author can change it | Knowledge is trapped; diagram dies when they leave |

---

## The Idea: Diagrams as Code

Diagrams as code flips every one of those problems:

| Binary image (old way) | Diagram as code |
|---|---|
| Drag-and-drop in a GUI tool | **Write** a few lines of text |
| Exported `.png` / `.svg` blob | Source markup committed to the repo |
| Lives in a wiki / Google Drive | Lives **next to the code** it describes |
| "Binary file changed" in the diff | A **readable line-by-line diff** in the PR |
| Updated manually, rarely | **Regenerated automatically** by the platform / CI |
| Edited only by its author | Edited by anyone who can write text |

The mental shift is exactly the same one the industry made for infrastructure (Infrastructure as Code) and configuration: **stop clicking, start committing.** When the picture is generated from committed text, it can be reviewed, versioned, branched, and diffed — and it can never quietly drift, because the text *is* the diagram and the text is in the repo with everything else.

---

## Why This Matters

- **Version-controlled.** Every change to the diagram is a commit with an author, a date, and a message. You can `git blame` a box and find out who added it and why.
- **Diff-able and reviewable.** A teammate sees `API --> Cache` appear in the PR diff and can comment "shouldn't that arrow go the other way?" You cannot review a screenshot.
- **Lives next to the code.** The diagram is in the same repo, often the same folder. When you touch the code, the diagram is right there, harder to forget.
- **No drift between a stale PNG and reality.** Because the source is text in the repo, an out-of-date diagram shows up as out-of-date code — caught in review like any other staleness.
- **Regenerated in CI.** A pipeline can re-render every diagram on each commit, so the published picture always matches the latest committed markup.
- **Accessible to every engineer.** You don't need design skills or a license to a drawing app. If you can type, you can produce a clean diagram — and update someone else's.

> The one-line argument: a diagram-as-code is *a diagram that participates in your normal engineering workflow* — commit, review, merge, CI — instead of living outside it where it rots.

---

## Your First Diagram: Mermaid

**Mermaid** is the place to start, for one decisive reason: GitHub and GitLab render it **natively** inside Markdown. You write a fenced code block tagged ` ```mermaid `, push it, and the picture appears in the rendered Markdown — no tooling, no build step.

A **flowchart** (process / logic):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User submits order]) --> Check{In stock?}
    Check -- yes --> Charge[Charge card]
    Check -- no --> Back[Notify backorder]
    Charge --> Ship[Ship order]
    Ship --> Done([Done])
```

A **sequence diagram** (who talks to whom, in what order):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as API
    participant DB as Database
    U->>A: POST /orders
    A->>DB: INSERT order
    DB-->>A: order id
    A-->>U: 201 Created
```

Notice what you did: you described *intent* ("user posts an order, the API inserts it, the DB returns an id") and Mermaid handled all the layout, arrows, and spacing. You never positioned a single box.

The basic flowchart vocabulary you need on day one:

```text
flowchart TD        direction: TD=top-down, LR=left-right, BT, RL
A --> B             solid arrow from A to B
A -- text --> B     arrow with a label
A([Rounded])        a "start/end" shape
A{Decision?}        a diamond (branch)
A[Box]              a plain rectangle (step)
```

---

## The Common Diagram Types

Mermaid (and the other tools) support far more than flowcharts. The most useful for an engineer:

An **ER (entity-relationship) diagram** — the shape of your data:


A **class diagram** — structure of objects/types:


A **state diagram** — the lifecycle of one thing:


You don't need to memorize the syntax — you look it up the first few times. What matters is recognizing that **each diagram type answers a different question**, covered below.

---

## The Same Idea in PlantUML

Mermaid isn't the only tool. **PlantUML** is older, supports the full UML standard, and is extremely popular in enterprise and Java circles. It renders via a small server or a local Java jar (and GitHub does *not* render it natively — you commit the `.puml` source and render it in CI or via a service like Kroki).

Here is **the same sequence** as the Mermaid example above, in PlantUML:

```text
@startuml
actor User
participant API
database Database

User -> API : POST /orders
API -> Database : INSERT order
Database --> API : order id
API --> User : 201 Created
@enduml
```

Same idea, different syntax. PlantUML tends to be more verbose but more capable (it covers component, deployment, and other UML diagrams Mermaid handles less fully). For a junior the takeaway is: **these are alternative dialects of the same concept** — text in, picture out. Pick the one your platform renders most easily; for most teams on GitHub/GitLab that is **Mermaid**.

---

## Graphviz / DOT

**Graphviz** is the granddaddy: a pure **graph-layout engine** with a tiny language called **DOT**. You declare nodes and edges; Graphviz computes a nice layout. Tons of tools generate DOT under the hood (dependency graphs, profilers, compilers).

```text
digraph services {
    rankdir=LR;
    web   -> api;
    api   -> db [label="reads/writes"];
    api   -> cache;
    worker -> queue;
    queue  -> worker;
}
```

Run `dot -Tsvg services.dot -o services.svg` and you get a laid-out picture. You'll meet DOT most often as *generated output* from other tools, but it's worth recognizing.

---

## Where Diagrams Live

The whole point is that diagrams live *with the code and docs*, embedded directly in the Markdown:

- In a **README** to show the high-level architecture ([READMEs & Onboarding](../03-readmes-and-onboarding-docs/junior.md)).
- In a **design doc / RFC** to show the proposed design ([Design Docs & RFCs](../06-design-docs-and-rfcs/junior.md)).
- In an **ADR** to illustrate a decision ([Architecture Decision Records](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/junior.md)).
- In a **runbook** to show an incident flow or system topology ([Runbooks & Ops Docs](../07-runbooks-and-operational-docs/junior.md)).
- In a docs site built with the **docs-as-code** toolchain ([Docs as Code & Tooling](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/junior.md)).

Because the diagram is a fenced block inside the Markdown, it travels with the document, renders in the same view, and is reviewed in the same PR.

---

## Which Diagram Answers Which Question

The single most useful skill is matching the diagram **type** to the **question** it answers. A diagram is a tool for answering *one* question for *one* audience.

| You want to show… | Use this diagram | It answers |
|---|---|---|
| How components talk over time / a protocol | **Sequence** | "In what order do these parts call each other?" |
| Logic, a process, a decision flow | **Flowchart** | "What are the steps and branches?" |
| The shape of your data | **ER diagram** | "What entities exist and how are they related?" |
| Object/type structure | **Class diagram** | "What are the types and their relationships?" |
| The lifecycle of one thing | **State diagram** | "What states can this be in, and what transitions are legal?" |
| Where software runs (infra) | **Deployment diagram** | "What runs on which machine/network?" |
| The big picture of a system | **Context / Container** (C4) | "What is this system, and what are its major parts?" |

> Rule of thumb: **one diagram, one question, one audience.** A diagram trying to show data *and* runtime *and* logic at once usually shows none of them clearly.

---

## Good Diagram Habits

Even at the junior level, a few habits separate a useful diagram from a confusing one:

- **Give it a title.** A diagram with no caption forces the reader to guess what they're looking at.
- **Be consistent with arrows.** Decide what an arrow *means* (a call? a data flow? a dependency?) and keep it the same throughout one diagram.
- **Keep one level of abstraction.** Don't mix a high-level "Payments Service" box with a low-level "for-loop" box in the same picture.
- **Keep it small.** Many small focused diagrams beat one giant "everything" diagram nobody can read.
- **Embed it in the doc.** A diagram in a folder by itself is half-useful; a diagram inside the README/ADR/runbook that explains it is fully useful.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Default to Mermaid** when your platform renders it natively (GitHub/GitLab/MkDocs). Zero setup, instant rendering.
2. **Commit the source, not just the image.** The text markup is the source of truth; a rendered PNG, if you keep one, is a build artifact.
3. **Put the diagram next to what it describes** — inside the README, ADR, design doc, or runbook.
4. **Pick the right diagram type** for the question (use the table above).
5. **One diagram, one idea.** Split a complex picture into several focused ones.
6. **Treat the diagram like code:** it goes through the same PR/review as the change it documents, updated in the *same* commit.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Pasting a screenshot of a drawing tool** into the docs — instantly un-reviewable and starts rotting immediately.
2. **The everything-diagram.** One sprawling picture with forty boxes that answers no question clearly.
3. **Mixing abstraction levels** — a cloud-region box next to a single function in the same diagram.
4. **Inconsistent arrows** — some arrows mean "calls", some mean "data flows", some mean "depends on", with no legend.
5. **Committing only the rendered `.png`** and losing the source, so the next person is back to a binary blob.
6. **Letting the diagram drift** — changing the code in a PR but not the diagram in the same PR. Diagrams are docs; they rot too.

---

## Tricky Points

- **GitHub renders Mermaid natively; it does *not* render PlantUML or DOT natively.** For PlantUML/Graphviz you render in CI or via a service like **Kroki**, then embed the resulting image — or you use a docs tool that supports them. This is the most common surprise for beginners.
- **A diagram is documentation, so it can rot.** "Diagrams as code" reduces rot dramatically (it's diffable and lives with the code) but does not eliminate it — you still must update the markup when reality changes.
- **Auto-layout is convenient but not always pretty.** The tool chooses the layout; you trade pixel-perfect control for zero maintenance. Usually a great trade, occasionally annoying.
- **The fenced block must be tagged correctly** (` ```mermaid `), or the platform shows raw text instead of a picture.

## Test Yourself

1. In one sentence, what is a "diagram as code"?
2. Why does a screenshot pasted into a wiki "rot," and how does diagrams-as-code fix that?
3. Name the two biggest advantages of text-based diagrams over exported images.
4. Which tool renders **natively** in GitHub Markdown, and which one usually needs CI or a render service?
5. Match each to its question: sequence, ER, state, flowchart.
6. What does "one diagram, one question, one audience" mean in practice?

## Cheat Sheet

```text
WHAT        diagram written as committed text markup, rendered automatically
WHY         versioned · diffable · reviewable · next to code · CI-rendered · no drift
START WITH  Mermaid (renders natively on GitHub/GitLab/MkDocs)
ALSO        PlantUML (full UML, render via CI/Kroki) · Graphviz/DOT (graph layout)

DIAGRAM → QUESTION
  sequence   → order of interactions / a protocol
  flowchart  → steps & decision branches
  ER         → shape of the data
  class      → type/object structure
  state      → lifecycle & legal transitions
  deployment → what runs where
  C4 context/container → the big-picture architecture

HABITS      title it · consistent arrows · one abstraction level ·
            small & focused · embed in the doc · update in the SAME PR
```

## Summary

- **Diagrams as code** = write a diagram in plain-text markup, commit it, render it automatically. Stop clicking, start committing.
- It fixes the **rotting screenshot**: text diagrams are version-controlled, diffable, reviewable in PRs, live next to the code, and can be regenerated in CI.
- **Mermaid** is the easiest start (native GitHub/GitLab rendering); **PlantUML** covers full UML; **Graphviz/DOT** is a graph-layout engine.
- Match the **diagram type to the question**: sequence, flowchart, ER, class, state, deployment, context/container.
- Good habits: title it, consistent arrows, one abstraction level, keep diagrams small and focused, embed them in the doc, and update them in the same PR as the code.
- Diagrams are documentation — they still rot if you don't maintain them.
