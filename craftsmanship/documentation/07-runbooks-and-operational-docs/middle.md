## Introduction

> Focus: **Why** and **When**

At the junior level, a runbook was a recipe for one alert. At the middle level you zoom out to the **incident** — the unplanned outage the runbooks exist to survive — and the *documents that structure a team's response to it*: severity definitions, the incident process doc, roles, the timeline, and above all the **blameless postmortem**.

A crucial scoping note: **this is a topic about the doc artifacts, not about incident management as a discipline.** Running incidents well — incident command, comms cadence, paging strategy — is the province of SRE (link conceptually to Google's *Site Reliability Engineering*). Here we care about *what gets written down*: the severity table, the playbook, the timeline, the postmortem. The doc is the part that outlives the incident and makes the *next* one shorter.

---

## The Incident Lifecycle and Where Docs Fit

An incident moves through phases, and a different operational doc supports each:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DET[Detect<br/>alert fires] --> TRI[Triage<br/>assess severity]
    TRI --> RESP[Respond<br/>coordinate + fix]
    RESP --> RES[Resolve<br/>verify recovery]
    RES --> LEARN[Learn<br/>postmortem]
    LEARN -.->|action items| DET

    DET -.->|reads| RB([Runbook])
    TRI -.->|reads| SEV([Severity table])
    RESP -.->|reads| PB([Incident playbook])
    LEARN -.->|writes| PM([Postmortem])
```

The dotted arrow back from **Learn** to **Detect** is the entire point: a postmortem isn't a report you file and forget — its action items *change the system and its docs* so the same failure can't recur (or recovers faster next time). An incident process that doesn't feed back is just paperwork.

---

## Severity Definitions

Before anyone can respond *proportionally*, the team must agree on what "bad" means. A **severity (SEV) table** is a short doc that maps impact to urgency and response. Without it, every responder guesses, and either over-reacts to a minor blip or under-reacts to a real outage.

| Severity | Definition | Example | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEV-1** | Critical: core service down or data loss; major customer impact | Checkout fully unavailable; primary DB lost | Page on-call immediately; declare incident; all-hands; status page |
| **SEV-2** | Major: significant degradation, partial outage, or SEV-1 imminent | Elevated error rate; one region degraded; disk filling fast | Page on-call; declare incident; senior responders |
| **SEV-3** | Minor: limited impact, workaround exists, not customer-visible | A non-critical job is failing; a single replica down | Handle in business hours; ticket; no page overnight |

The severity table earns its keep in two ways: it tells the on-call engineer **how hard to react** (do I wake people up?), and it standardizes language so "we have a SEV-2" means the same thing to everyone. *Impact* (what's broken, who's affected) drives the *severity* (the label); keep them distinct.

---

## Incident Roles and the Process Doc

For anything above a small SEV-3, one person fixing while also updating stakeholders, taking notes, and deciding strategy is a recipe for chaos. The **incident process doc** defines roles so the response is coordinated, not improvised. The canonical three (from SRE incident management):

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Incident Commander (IC)** | Owns the response. Decides strategy, delegates, holds the big picture. Does *not* fix the bug themselves — they coordinate. |
| **Communications (Comms) Lead** | Keeps stakeholders and customers informed: status page, internal updates, exec summaries. Shields responders from interruptions. |
| **Scribe** | Records the timeline in real time: every action, observation, and decision with timestamps. Feeds the postmortem. |

(On a small team one person may wear several hats — but the *doc* still names the roles so everyone knows who's doing what when it gets big.)

The incident playbook (introduced at [Junior](junior.md)) is where this lives: it states who declares an incident, how roles are assigned, the comms cadence (e.g., "update the status page every 30 min"), and — critically — **links out to the relevant runbooks** for the actual technical fixes. The playbook coordinates; the runbooks remediate.

---

## The Incident Timeline

The **timeline** is the factual spine of the whole incident. The scribe records, with timestamps (always UTC to avoid timezone confusion), every meaningful event:

```text
TIMELINE (all times UTC)
13:42  Alert APILatencyHigh fires; on-call paged
13:45  On-call ACKs; opens runbook; confirms p99 latency 4.2s (normal <300ms)
13:51  Incident declared SEV-2; @alex assumes IC; @sam = scribe; @jo = comms
13:58  Identified: a deploy at 13:30 introduced an unbounded query
14:04  IC decides to roll back the 13:30 deploy
14:09  Rollback started (runbook: deploy/rollback.md)
14:16  Rollback complete; p99 latency dropping
14:22  p99 back to 240ms; alert clears
14:25  Incident resolved; monitoring for recurrence
14:40  Incident closed; postmortem assigned to @alex, due in 3 business days
```

A timeline matters because human memory of a stressful event is unreliable and self-serving. Written *as it happens*, the timeline is the objective record the postmortem analyzes — and it surfaces the metric that matters: **MTTD** (time to detect, 13:42), **time to declare** (13:51), and **MTTR** (resolved 14:25 → ~43 min). You can only improve what you measure.

---

## The Blameless Postmortem

The **postmortem** (Google SRE's term; some call it a "retrospective" or "incident review") is a written analysis produced after every significant incident. Its defining property is that it is **blameless**.

> A **blameless postmortem** assumes everyone acted reasonably given what they knew at the time, and focuses entirely on *systemic* causes — the conditions that let the failure happen — rather than on punishing the individual whose action triggered it.

### Why blameless, specifically

This is not soft "be nice" culture; it is a hard engineering requirement, and the reasoning is mechanical:

- **Blame destroys information.** If the engineer who ran the bad command will be punished, the *next* engineer hides their mistakes, omits details from the timeline, and avoids reporting near-misses. You lose exactly the data you need to prevent recurrence.
- **People rarely cause incidents; systems let them.** If one mistyped command can take down production, the defect is the *system that allowed it* (no confirmation, no canary, no guardrail), not the human who typed it. "Human error" is the *start* of the investigation, not the conclusion.
- **The goal is prevention, not accountability theater.** A postmortem that ends in "Bob will be more careful" prevents nothing — Bob was already trying to be careful. A postmortem that ends in "add a confirmation prompt and a canary gate" prevents the *class* of failure for everyone.

> The blameless rule of thumb: replace "*who* did this?" with "*what about the system* made this easy to do and hard to catch?"

### Standard postmortem structure

The canonical sections (Google SRE):

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Summary** | One paragraph: what happened, impact, duration. Readable by an exec. |
| **Impact** | Quantified: users affected, requests failed, revenue/SLO burn, duration. |
| **Timeline** | The factual sequence (from the scribe), UTC, timestamped. |
| **Root cause(s)** | The *systemic* cause(s) — often via "5 whys"; usually more than one. |
| **What went well** | Detection, response, tooling that worked — preserve these. |
| **What went poorly** | Gaps: slow detection, missing runbook, confusing dashboard. |
| **Action items** | Concrete, *owned*, *dated*, tracked fixes — the only part that prevents recurrence. |

The **action items** are the heart. Everything else explains; only action items change the future. Each must have an owner, a due date, and a tracking ticket — a postmortem whose action items are vague ("improve monitoring") or unowned is a postmortem that changes nothing.

# Postmortem: API latency spike from unbounded query (2026-06-09)

**Status:** Final   **Authors:** @alex   **Reviewers:** @maya, @team-lead
**Incident date:** 2026-06-09   **Severity:** SEV-2   **Duration:** 43 min

## Summary
A deploy at 13:30 UTC introduced a query without a LIMIT clause on the
/orders endpoint. p99 latency rose from ~240ms to 4.2s, causing client
timeouts and a 12% error rate for 43 minutes. Resolved by rolling back
the deploy.

## Impact
- ~38,000 requests timed out; ~4,500 checkout attempts failed.
- Error-budget burn for the month: ~30%.
- Customer-visible: yes (slow/failed checkout). Est. revenue impact: ~$11k.

## Root Cause(s)
1. A code change added a query missing a `LIMIT`, scanning the full table
   under production data volumes (the dev dataset was small, so it was fast
   in testing — connascence between query and data size went unnoticed).
2. No automated check for unbounded queries in CI.
3. The deploy went straight to 100% with no canary, so the regression hit
   all traffic at once instead of 1%.

## What Went Well
- Alerting detected the latency in 12 min; the runbook's rollback steps
  were accurate and the rollback was clean.

## What Went Poorly
- No canary stage meant blast radius was 100% immediately.
- The "API latency" runbook had no step for "correlate with recent deploys,"
  so the responders spent ~7 min before suspecting the deploy.

## Action Items
| # | Action | Owner | Due | Ticket | Type |
|---|--------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| 1 | Add canary stage (1% → 100%) to the deploy pipeline | @sam | 06-20 | OPS-812 | mitigate |
| 2 | Add CI lint flagging queries without LIMIT/pagination | @maya | 06-23 | OPS-813 | prevent |
| 3 | Add "check recent deploys" step to api-latency runbook | @alex | 06-13 | OPS-814 | detect |
````

Note action item #3: a runbook gap *discovered during the incident* becomes a tracked fix. That is the feedback loop in action.

---

## Closing the Loop: Postmortems Feed Runbooks

The most underused output of a postmortem is **better operational docs.** Every incident is a free, brutally honest test of your runbooks. After each one, ask:

- **Was there a runbook for this?** If not, write one now (the steps are fresh).
- **Did the runbook work?** If a step was wrong, missing, or slow, fix it — that's an action item.
- **Did the alert link to the right runbook?** If the page didn't carry the procedure, fix the alert annotation.
- **Could this be automated?** If the fix was mechanical (the rollback was just running one command), consider turning the runbook step into a script or a button (the executable-runbook direction, covered at [Senior](senior.md)).

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    INC[Incident] --> PM[Postmortem]
    PM --> AI[Action items]
    AI --> NRB[New/updated runbook]
    AI --> NA[New/tuned alert]
    AI --> AUTO[Automation of a manual step]
    NRB --> FASTER["Next incident: shorter MTTR"]
    NA --> FASTER
    AUTO --> FASTER
```

This loop is *why* the topic links forward to [Keeping Docs Alive](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/): the postmortem is one of the most reliable forcing functions for keeping operational docs current, because a doc that just failed an engineer at 3 a.m. has a very motivated person to fix it.

---

## Disaster Recovery: RTO, RPO, and Backup-Restore

Some operational docs cover the catastrophic case — the database is gone, the region is down. These are **disaster-recovery (DR)** procedures, and they're governed by two numbers the business must agree on:

> **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** the maximum acceptable *time* to restore service after a disaster. "We can be down at most 1 hour."
>
> **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** the maximum acceptable *data loss*, measured in time. "We can lose at most 5 minutes of data."

| | RTO | RPO |
|---|---|---|
| Measures | How long until we're back up | How much data we can lose |
| Driven by | Restore/failover speed | Backup frequency / replication lag |
| "1 hour" means | Down ≤ 1 hour | Lose ≤ 1 hour of data |
| Improved by | Faster failover, warm standbys, rehearsed restores | More frequent backups, synchronous replication |

The DR doc that operators actually need is the **backup-restore procedure**: where backups live, how to verify one is good, and the *exact* steps to restore. The unforgivable mistake here is the **untested backup** — a backup nobody has ever restored is a hope, not a recovery plan. A DR runbook must be *rehearsed* (a restore drill), or you will discover during a real disaster that the backups were corrupt, incomplete, or un-restorable. (Backup/restore mechanics belong to database operations; here the point is that the *procedure* is a first-class operational doc that must be tested.)

## When to Write a Runbook (and When Not To)

Not everything needs a runbook, and writing one for the wrong thing is wasted effort that then rots. A useful decision rule:

| Situation | Write a runbook? |
|---|---|
| An alert that **pages a human** | **Yes** — and link it from the alert (non-negotiable) |
| A recurring manual operational task (rotate cert, scale up, failover) | **Yes** — and consider automating it |
| A one-off task you'll never repeat | No — note it in the relevant ticket instead |
| A fix you can fully **automate** | Automate it; the script *is* the runbook (see [Senior](senior.md)) |
| A purely informational "how the system works" doc | That's a design doc / architecture map, not a runbook |

The guiding principle: **a runbook is for a procedure that (a) will be needed under pressure and (b) isn't yet automated.** If it'll never recur, skip it; if it can be automated, prefer that.

---

## Trade-offs

| Decision | One side | Other side |
|---|---|---|
| **Detail vs. speed** | Exhaustive runbook covers every branch | Long runbooks are slow to scan at 3 a.m. — lead with the common case |
| **Prose runbook vs. automation** | Prose is fast to write, flexible | Automation is faster and can't be skipped — but costs more to build/maintain |
| **Postmortem depth vs. throughput** | Deep analysis on every incident | Reserve full postmortems for SEV-1/2; lightweight notes for SEV-3 |
| **Severity strictness** | Tight SEV-1 criteria avoid alarm fatigue | Too tight and real outages get under-resourced |
| **Blameless culture cost** | Takes deliberate effort to sustain | Without it, you lose the data that prevents recurrence |

The recurring tension is **speed during the incident vs. completeness of the doc.** The resolution: structure the runbook so the *most likely* path is at the top and fast, with the long tail of edge cases below — the tired reader hits the common fix immediately and only scrolls when it doesn't apply.

---

## Edge Cases

### 1. The incident with no runbook
It happens. The playbook should cover this: declare the incident, assign roles, and have the IC drive ad-hoc diagnosis — *then* the first action item is "write the runbook we wished we had."

### 2. The runbook step that's now dangerous
Infra changed and a remediation command would now cause harm. This is why runbooks need review (and ideally testing) — a stale destructive step is the worst failure mode. Flag it loudly until fixed.

### 3. Cascading / multi-service incidents
No single runbook applies; this is a *playbook* situation. The architecture map (for operators) becomes essential to reason about blast radius and dependency order.

### 4. The "fixed itself" incident
The alert cleared before anyone acted. Still worth a lightweight postmortem — auto-recovery you don't understand is a future SEV-1 waiting for the conditions to line up differently.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Blameless ≠ accountability-free.** Blameless means no *punishment* for honest mistakes; the team is still accountable for *fixing the system*. Action items have owners and dates — that's accountability for the fix, not blame for the cause.
- **Root cause is usually plural.** Real incidents have *contributing factors*, not a single root cause. A postmortem that names one cause and stops has under-investigated.
- **The timeline must be written live.** Reconstructed-from-memory timelines are inaccurate and biased. The scribe role exists precisely so it's captured as it happens.
- **A postmortem with no action items (or unowned ones) prevents nothing.** The analysis is worthless without owned, dated, tracked follow-through.
- **RTO and RPO are easy to confuse.** Time-to-recover vs. data-loss-window. Mixing them up leads to backups that meet the wrong objective.
- **Severity is for response, not blame.** A SEV-1 isn't "someone failed"; it's "this needs maximum response *now*."

---

## Best Practices

1. **Define severities once, in a table** everyone shares; let impact drive the label.
2. **Name incident roles** (IC / Comms / Scribe) in the playbook, even if one person wears several hats on a small team.
3. **Scribe the timeline live, in UTC.** It's the objective record the postmortem rests on.
4. **Run every significant incident's postmortem blamelessly** — systemic causes, not individuals.
5. **Make action items owned, dated, and tracked.** They're the only part that prevents recurrence.
6. **Feed postmortems back into runbooks and alerts** — fix the gap the incident exposed while it's fresh.
7. **Define RTO/RPO with the business** and **rehearse the restore** — an untested backup is not a backup.
8. **Lead runbooks with the common case;** push edge cases lower so the 3 a.m. path is fast.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Why must a postmortem be blameless — give the mechanical (information) reason, not the moral one.
2. List the standard sections of a postmortem.
3. What are the three canonical incident roles, and what does each do?
4. Define RTO and RPO, and give an example of each.
5. Why is an untested backup not a backup?
6. Describe the feedback loop from postmortem to runbook.
7. Why must the incident timeline be written live rather than reconstructed afterward?

---

## Summary

- The middle level zooms out to the **incident** and the docs that structure the response: the **severity table**, the **incident playbook** with named **roles**, the **live timeline**, and the **blameless postmortem**.
- A postmortem is **blameless** for a hard engineering reason — blame destroys the information needed to prevent recurrence — and its **owned, dated action items** are the only part that actually changes the future.
- Postmortems **feed back into runbooks, alerts, and automation**, which is how operational docs stay honest and MTTR keeps dropping.
- **Disaster-recovery** docs are governed by **RTO** (recovery time) and **RPO** (data loss), and a backup-restore procedure is worthless until it's been **rehearsed**.
- Write runbooks for **paging alerts and recurring manual tasks**; skip one-offs; **automate** what you can.
