# Code Comments & Docstrings — Junior

> **Category:** [Documentation](../README.md) — writing the docs that live *inside* the code: docstrings that describe a function's contract, and the tooling that turns them into a published API reference.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

There are two kinds of writing that lives inside source files, and beginners blur them constantly:

1. **Comments** — free-text notes for whoever reads the *source code*. They explain a tricky line, a non-obvious decision, a workaround. They are *style* — when to leave one, what to say. That belongs to **Clean Code → Comments**, and this topic deliberately points you there for it.
2. **Docstrings (a.k.a. API doc comments)** — structured documentation attached to a function, class, or module, written in a tool-readable format so a **doc generator** can extract them and publish an **API reference**. A docstring describes the *contract* of a thing — what it does, what it takes, what it returns, what it can throw — for someone who will *call* the code without reading its body.

> **This topic is about the second kind.** A docstring is not "a comment that happens to be at the top of a function." It is a *first-class, generated artifact*: you write it once, in code, and a tool turns it into searchable HTML, IDE tooltips, and `--help` text.

### Why this matters

The body of a function tells you *how* it works. Its docstring tells you *how to use it without reading the how*. The whole point of a library — `requests`, the Java standard library, `lodash`, Go's `net/http` — is that you call it from its documented contract and never open its source. That documented contract is the docstrings, rendered by a generator. Get docstrings right and your code becomes usable by people who will never read it. Get them wrong (or omit them) and every caller has to reverse-engineer your function from its implementation.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write functions, classes, and modules in at least one language, and you understand parameters, return values, and exceptions/errors.
- **Required:** You can run a command-line tool and read its output (you'll run a doc generator).
- **Helpful:** Exposure to a public library's online API reference (e.g., docs.python.org, the Javadoc for `java.util.List`, pkg.go.dev). That *is* generated docstring output — you've been reading docstrings for years without knowing it.
- **Helpful:** A feel for [why and what to document](../01-why-and-what-to-document/junior.md) — docstrings are the "reference" slice of that bigger picture.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Comment** | Free-text note in source for a code *reader*; about style/intent of a specific line or block. (Style → Clean Code → Comments.) |
| **Docstring / doc comment** | Structured documentation attached to a declaration (function, class, module) in a tool-readable format, intended to be *extracted* and published. |
| **API reference** | The generated, browsable catalog of every public function/type and its docstring — the "reference" doc type. |
| **Doc generator** | A tool that reads source + docstrings and emits a reference site / IDE data (Sphinx, Javadoc, JSDoc, godoc, rustdoc, Doxygen). |
| **Contract** | What a function promises: inputs (preconditions), output (postconditions), errors it raises, units, nullability, thread-safety. |
| **Doc-test** | An example *inside* a docstring that a test runner executes, so the example can't silently go stale (Python `doctest`, Rust doc-tests). |
| **Doc rot** | Documentation that has drifted out of sync with the code it describes — the chronic failure mode of all docs. |
| **Self-documenting code** | Code clear enough (from names and structure) that it needs no comment to explain *what* it does. |

## Comments vs. Docstrings: the One Distinction to Get Right

```text
  COMMENT                                   DOCSTRING
  ───────────────────────────────────       ─────────────────────────────────────
  audience: someone reading the SOURCE       audience: someone CALLING the function
  format:   free text (// or #)              format:   structured, tool-readable
  purpose:  explain a tricky line / WHY      purpose:  describe the public CONTRACT
  output:   read in-place, never extracted   output:   EXTRACTED into an API reference
  lives in: anywhere (inline, block)         lives in: attached to a declaration
  covered in: Clean Code → Comments          covered in: THIS topic
```

A quick test: *"Will a tool pull this text out and put it on a docs website / in an IDE tooltip?"* If yes, it's a docstring and it must follow a convention. If it's just there to help the next person reading line 42, it's a comment.

```python
def withdraw(self, amount: Decimal) -> Decimal:
    """Debit `amount` from the account and return the new balance.    # ← DOCSTRING

    Raises:
        InsufficientFunds: if `amount` exceeds the available balance.
    """
    # We lock the row pessimistically here because two ATMs can hit the   # ← COMMENT
    # same account at once; optimistic retry caused double-spends in 2023.  (a WHY note)
    with self._row_lock():
        ...
```

The docstring is the contract a caller reads in the generated reference. The `#` comment is a *why* note for a maintainer reading the body — and its style (when to write it, how to phrase it) is the subject of **Clean Code → Comments**, not this file.

---

## Comment Philosophy in Brief

We cover this only enough to set the stage; the depth lives in **Clean Code → Comments**.

> **Comment *why*, not *what*.** The code already says what it does. A comment earns its place by explaining the *reason* — a non-obvious decision, a workaround, a constraint the code can't express.

```python
# BAD — restates the code (the "what"). Noise.
i += 1          # increment i

# GOOD — explains the "why" the code can't.
# Skip the header row; the export tool emits one even for empty result sets.
i += 1
```

The governing idea: **prefer self-documenting code to comments.** A good name beats a comment that explains a bad one.

```python
# Needs a comment because the name hides intent:
d = days * 86400          # convert days to seconds

# Needs no comment — the name IS the explanation:
SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400
total_seconds = days * SECONDS_PER_DAY
```

A useful (if slightly overstated) framing: **a comment is an apology for code that isn't clear enough.** Don't be an absolutist about it — some *why* genuinely needs prose (a regulation, a hardware quirk, a "we tried the obvious thing and it broke"). But reach for a clearer name or a smaller function first.

**Comment smells** (the things to *delete*, covered fully in Clean Code → Comments):

| Smell | Example | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Redundant** | `i++ // add one to i` | Delete it. |
| **Outdated** | A comment describing logic that changed two refactors ago | Delete or correct it. |
| **Commented-out code** | A block of dead code "in case we need it" | Delete it — that's what version control is for. |
| **Noise** | `// constructor` above a constructor | Delete it. |

> The line for this topic: we acknowledge comment philosophy, then spend the rest of our energy on **docstrings + generators**, because *that* is the part this topic owns. For everything about inline-comment *style*, go to **Clean Code → Comments**.

## What a Docstring Is

A docstring documents the **contract** of a code element so it can be used as a black box. It answers, for a caller who will never read the body:

- **What** does this do? (one-line summary)
- **What** does it take? (each parameter: meaning, type, units, allowed range)
- **What** does it return? (type and meaning)
- **What** can go wrong? (exceptions/errors raised, and when)
- **How** do I call it? (a short example)
- **What** are the caveats? (thread-safety, nullability, side effects, ownership)

The key reframe from comment to docstring: a comment is read *in place*; a docstring is **extracted and republished**. That single fact drives everything — it must follow a convention the generator understands, it must make sense out of context (no "see the comment above"), and it is part of your public API surface.

---

## Docstring Conventions by Language

Every mainstream language has a convention and a tool that reads it. The shape differs but the *intent* is identical: a structured block attached to a declaration.

| Language | Convention | Marker | Tags / structure | Generator |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Python** | PEP 257 + a style (Google / NumPy / reST) | `"""triple-quoted string"""` as first statement | `Args:` / `Returns:` / `Raises:` (Google) | Sphinx (autodoc), pdoc |
| **Java** | Javadoc | `/** ... */` above the declaration | `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, `@deprecated` | `javadoc` tool |
| **JS / TS** | JSDoc / TSDoc | `/** ... */` above the declaration | `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` (types often inferred in TS) | JSDoc, TypeDoc |
| **Go** | godoc convention | `// ...` directly above the declaration | full sentences, *starting with the identifier name* | `go doc`, pkg.go.dev |
| **Rust** | rustdoc | `///` above the declaration (Markdown) | `# Examples`, `# Panics`, `# Errors` sections | `rustdoc` (`cargo doc`) |
| **C#** | XML doc comments | `/// ...` above the declaration | `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<exception>` | DocFX, Sandcastle |

Two conventions to memorize because their *rules* trip up beginners:

- **Python:** the docstring must be the **first statement** in the module/function/class — a string literal, not a `#` comment. `def f(): # docs` is a comment; `def f(): """docs"""` is a docstring.
- **Go:** the doc comment is a plain `//` comment placed **immediately above** the declaration with no blank line, and by convention it is a **full sentence that begins with the name being documented** (`// Withdraw debits ...`). That phrasing is not a quirk — godoc renders it directly.

---

## Anatomy of a Good Docstring

Here is the same well-formed contract in four languages. Notice they all carry the *same* information; only the syntax changes.

### Python (Google style)

```python
def withdraw(account_id: str, amount: Decimal) -> Decimal:
    """Debit an amount from an account and return the new balance.

    Args:
        account_id: The account to debit. Must reference an existing account.
        amount: Money to withdraw, in the account's currency. Must be > 0.

    Returns:
        The account's new balance after the debit.

    Raises:
        AccountNotFound: If `account_id` does not exist.
        InsufficientFunds: If `amount` exceeds the available balance.
    """
```

### Java (Javadoc)

```java
/**
 * Debits an amount from an account and returns the new balance.
 *
 * @param accountId the account to debit; must reference an existing account
 * @param amount    money to withdraw, in the account's currency; must be > 0
 * @return the account's new balance after the debit
 * @throws AccountNotFoundException  if {@code accountId} does not exist
 * @throws InsufficientFundsException if {@code amount} exceeds the balance
 */
BigDecimal withdraw(String accountId, BigDecimal amount) { ... }
```

### TypeScript (TSDoc)

```typescript
/**
 * Debits an amount from an account and returns the new balance.
 *
 * @param accountId - The account to debit; must reference an existing account.
 * @param amount - Money to withdraw, in the account's currency; must be > 0.
 * @returns The account's new balance after the debit.
 * @throws {InsufficientFundsError} If `amount` exceeds the available balance.
 */
function withdraw(accountId: string, amount: number): number { ... }
```

### Go (godoc convention)

```go
// Withdraw debits amount from the account identified by accountID and
// returns the new balance. amount must be positive.
//
// It returns ErrAccountNotFound if the account does not exist, and
// ErrInsufficientFunds if amount exceeds the available balance.
func Withdraw(accountID string, amount Money) (Money, error) { ... }
```

In Go there are no `@param` tags — the convention is well-written full sentences, starting with the function name, that godoc renders verbatim. Errors are documented in prose because Go returns them as values.

---

## Bad Docstring vs. Good Docstring

The single most common junior mistake is a docstring that just *restates the signature* — it adds zero information a reader couldn't get from reading the function name and parameters.

```python
# BAD — restates the signature; useless. (And note: it documents "the what"
# that the code already shows.)
def transfer(src, dst, amount):
    """Transfer.

    Args:
        src: the src
        dst: the dst
        amount: the amount
    """

# GOOD — documents the CONTRACT a caller can't see from the signature.
def transfer(src: str, dst: str, amount: Decimal) -> None:
    """Move money from one account to another, atomically.

    Both accounts are locked for the duration; the debit and credit either
    both succeed or both roll back. `amount` is in the source account's
    currency and must be positive.

    Raises:
        InsufficientFunds: if `src` lacks the balance (nothing is moved).
        CurrencyMismatch:  if `src` and `dst` hold different currencies.
    """
```

The good version tells you the things you *cannot* infer from `transfer(src, dst, amount)`: it's atomic, both accounts lock, the currency and sign rules, and exactly what happens on failure (nothing is moved). **That** is what a docstring is for.

> The test for a docstring line: *"Could the reader have known this from the signature alone?"* If yes, delete the line. If no, it's earning its place.

---

## Doc Generators: From Source to a Reference Site

A docstring is raw material. A **doc generator** is the machine that turns it into the API reference your users actually read. The pipeline is the same everywhere:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SRC["Source code<br/>+ docstrings"] --> GEN["Doc generator<br/>(Sphinx / Javadoc /<br/>JSDoc / godoc / rustdoc)"]
    GEN --> OUT["API reference<br/>(HTML site, IDE tooltips,<br/>man pages, PDF)"]
    OUT --> USER["Caller reads the<br/>contract — never the body"]
```

| Generator | Ecosystem | What it reads | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sphinx** (with `autodoc`) | Python | docstrings (reST/Google/NumPy) | HTML site (Read the Docs), PDF |
| **Javadoc** | Java | `/** */` Javadoc comments | HTML API reference |
| **JSDoc / TypeDoc** | JS / TypeScript | JSDoc/TSDoc comments + TS types | HTML site |
| **godoc / pkg.go.dev** | Go | `//` doc comments | the package page on pkg.go.dev |
| **rustdoc** (`cargo doc`) | Rust | `///` Markdown doc comments | HTML site, *runs doc-tests* |
| **Doxygen** | C / C++ / many | structured comments | HTML, LaTeX, call graphs |
| **DocFX** | C# / .NET | XML doc comments | docs site |

The reference site a generator produces is the **"reference" mode** of documentation — terse, complete, lookup-oriented. (Reference is one of four doc types in the Diátaxis model; see [Why & What to Document](../01-why-and-what-to-document/junior.md) and [API & Reference Documentation](../04-api-and-reference-documentation/junior.md).) You usually don't *write* a reference site by hand — you write good docstrings and let the generator build it.

### Try it (Go, zero install)

```bash
# In any Go module, see the generated reference from your doc comments:
go doc ./...            # one-line summaries for the package
go doc YourType.Method  # the full doc comment for one declaration
```

That output *is* your docstrings, extracted. The same text appears on pkg.go.dev when you publish.

---

## Doc-Tests: Documentation That Can't Lie

The deepest problem with examples in docs is that they **rot** — the API changes, the example doesn't, and now your docs actively lie. **Doc-tests** solve this: the example lives *in the docstring* and is **executed by the test runner**, so a stale example fails CI.

### Python `doctest`

```python
def slugify(title: str) -> str:
    """Turn a title into a URL slug.

    >>> slugify("Hello, World!")
    'hello-world'
    >>> slugify("  Trailing  spaces ")
    'trailing-spaces'
    """
    return "-".join(title.lower().split())  # (bug: doesn't strip punctuation)
```

Run it:

```bash
python -m doctest module.py -v
```

The first example **fails** (`'hello,-world!'` ≠ `'hello-world'`), exposing the bug *and* the fact that the docstring promised behavior the code doesn't deliver. The example and the code are now forced to agree.

### Rust doc-tests

```rust
/// Returns the slug form of a title.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// assert_eq!(mycrate::slugify("Hello World"), "hello-world");
/// ```
pub fn slugify(title: &str) -> String { /* ... */ }
```

`cargo test` runs that fenced code block as a real test. Rust treats doc examples as part of the test suite by default — your docs literally cannot drift from the API without turning the build red.

> Doc-tests are the antidote to doc rot for examples: docs that are *verified*, not just *written*. More on fighting rot in [Keeping Docs Alive & Doc Rot](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/junior.md).

## Best Practices

1. **Document the contract, not the implementation.** Inputs, output, errors, units, side effects — the things a caller can't see. Leave the *how* to the code.
2. **Write the one-line summary first.** A single imperative sentence ("Debit an amount and return the new balance") that fits in an IDE tooltip.
3. **Don't restate the signature.** If a line could be inferred from the name and types, cut it.
4. **Follow your language's convention exactly** so the generator can parse it (PEP 257 / Javadoc tags / godoc full sentences / TSDoc).
5. **Document every public thing; relax for private internals.** Public API gets full docstrings; a private one-line helper often needs none.
6. **Prefer doc-tested examples** where the language supports them (Python `doctest`, Rust doc-tests) — they can't go stale.
7. **For inline comment *style*, defer to Clean Code → Comments.** This topic owns docstrings; that one owns comments.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing comments with docstrings.** Putting the contract in a `#` comment the generator won't extract, or putting a *why* note in the docstring where callers don't need it.
2. **Restating the signature.** `amount: the amount`. Pure noise that wastes the reader's attention.
3. **Documenting the *how*.** "Loops over the list and sums the prices" — the body shows that; document *what* it returns and when it throws.
4. **Wrong placement (Python/Go).** A `#` comment instead of a `"""docstring"""`; a Go doc comment with a blank line above the `func` (godoc won't attach it).
5. **Examples that lie.** A hand-written example that no longer runs. Use doc-tests so it can't.
6. **Over-documenting trivial getters.** `"""Return the name."""` on `get_name()` is noise; the signature already says it.
7. **Forgetting errors.** The most-omitted and most-needed part of a contract: *what exceptions can this raise, and when?*

---

## Tricky Points

- **A docstring is part of your public API.** Changing what it promises is a contract change, like changing a parameter — callers depend on it.
- **Python: it must be a string literal, first statement.** `def f(): "docs"` works; `def f(): # docs` does not — that's a comment the generator ignores.
- **Go: phrasing is the convention.** Start the comment with the identifier and write full sentences; godoc renders it as-is, so "increments the counter" reads worse than "Increment increments the counter."
- **TypeScript: don't repeat types in JSDoc.** TS already knows the types; `@param {string} name` duplicates what the compiler enforces. Document *meaning*, not type.
- **Doc-tests are tests.** A failing `doctest` should fail your build. If they're not run in CI, they rot like any other example.

---

## Test Yourself

1. In one sentence each, distinguish a *comment* from a *docstring* by audience and output.
2. State the comment philosophy in five words.
3. Name four things a good docstring documents that a reader *can't* see from the signature.
4. Why is "restates the signature" the cardinal docstring sin?
5. What does a doc generator do, and name one for Python, Java, and Go.
6. What problem do doc-tests solve, and name two languages that support them.
7. In Go, where does the doc comment go and how should its first word read?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
COMMENT vs DOCSTRING
  comment    → for SOURCE readers, free text, explains WHY, not extracted
  docstring  → for CALLERS, structured, describes the CONTRACT, EXTRACTED

COMMENT PHILOSOPHY (depth → Clean Code → Comments)
  comment WHY not WHAT · self-documenting code first · delete: redundant,
  outdated, commented-out, noise

DOCSTRING = the CONTRACT
  summary · params (meaning/units/range) · returns · errors-and-when
  · example · caveats (thread-safety, nullability, side effects)
  RULE: never restate the signature; document what the caller can't see

CONVENTIONS
  Python  """first statement""" (PEP 257; Google/NumPy/reST)
  Java    /** */  @param @return @throws
  JS/TS   /** */  JSDoc/TSDoc (don't repeat TS types)
  Go      // above decl, full sentence starting with the Name
  Rust    /// markdown, # Examples / # Panics / # Errors
  C#      /// XML <summary><param><returns><exception>

GENERATORS:  Sphinx · Javadoc · JSDoc/TypeDoc · godoc · rustdoc · Doxygen · DocFX
DOC-TESTS:   Python doctest · Rust doc-tests  → examples that CAN'T rot (run in CI)
```

## Summary

- Source files contain two different things: **comments** (free text for *readers*, style covered in Clean Code → Comments) and **docstrings** (structured contracts for *callers*, extracted by a generator — the subject of this topic).
- The comment philosophy in brief: **comment *why*, not *what***; prefer self-documenting code; delete redundant/outdated/commented-out/noise comments.
- A **docstring documents the contract**: summary, params (with units/ranges), return, errors-and-when, example, caveats — never restating the signature.
- Every language has a **convention + generator**: PEP 257/Sphinx, Javadoc, JSDoc/TypeDoc, godoc, rustdoc, Doxygen, DocFX. The generated reference is Diátaxis's "reference" mode.
- **Doc-tests** (Python `doctest`, Rust doc-tests) make examples *executable*, so they can't rot.
