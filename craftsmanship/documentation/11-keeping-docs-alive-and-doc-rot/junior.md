# Keeping Docs Alive & Fighting Doc Rot — Junior

> **Category:** [Documentation](../README.md) — the capstone discipline: keeping documentation *true* as the code and systems it describes change underneath it.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to fight it?**

Every other topic in this section taught you how to *write* a kind of document — a [README](../03-readmes-and-onboarding-docs/), an [API reference](../04-api-and-reference-documentation/), an [ADR](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/), a [changelog](../09-changelogs-and-release-notes/). This final topic is about the one thing that decides whether any of that effort was worth it: **keeping the document true after you write it.**

> **Doc rot** is documentation that has drifted out of sync with reality. The code changed; the doc didn't. The setup steps no longer work, the endpoint it describes was deleted six months ago, the screenshot shows a UI that no longer exists, and the "current" decision was superseded last quarter.

The central, counter-intuitive claim of this topic — the one everything else hangs on — is this:

> **A wrong document is worse than no document at all.**

A missing doc costs you a little time (you go ask someone, or read the code). A *wrong* doc actively sends you down the wrong path, wastes hours, causes incidents, and — worst of all — destroys trust. Once an engineer gets burned by a stale doc, they stop trusting *all* the docs, and a team's documentation collapses into something nobody reads and nobody updates.

So "keeping docs alive" is not a nice-to-have at the end of the writing process. It is the *point*. The real skill in documentation is not producing prose — it's building docs that **resist rot** by construction, so they stay true with little or no manual effort.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You have written at least one real doc — a README, a docstring, or an API note — and seen it go stale.
- **Required:** Comfort with version control (git), pull requests, and the idea of a CI pipeline that runs checks on every change.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to **[docs as code](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/)** — keeping documentation in the same repository as the code, reviewed in the same pull request.
- **Helpful:** A feel for what "the single source of truth" means — that a fact should live in exactly one authoritative place.

---

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Doc rot (documentation drift)** | Documentation that has fallen out of sync with the code/system it describes. |
| **Stale doc** | A specific document that is now wrong because reality changed without it. |
| **Single source of truth (SSOT)** | The one authoritative place a fact lives; other views are *generated* from it, never copied. |
| **Generated docs** | Documentation produced automatically from the source of truth (code, schema, spec) rather than hand-written. |
| **Executable / tested docs** | Documentation whose examples actually run in CI, so they fail the build if they break. |
| **Docs as code** | Treating docs like code: same repo, version control, code review, CI checks. |
| **Trust collapse** | The point where engineers stop believing *any* docs because they've been burned by stale ones. |
| **Freshness signal** | Metadata (e.g. a `last_reviewed` date) that tells a reader how trustworthy a doc still is. |
| **Doc gardening** | The ongoing, never-finished work of pruning, updating, and deleting docs to keep them healthy. |
| **Optimize for deletion** | Prefer fewer docs and an easy path to delete them; less surface area means less to rot. |

---

## What Doc Rot Looks Like

Doc rot is not abstract. You have hit every one of these:

- **Stale setup steps.** The README says `npm install && npm start`, but the project moved to a different package manager and a Docker container a year ago. A new hire spends a morning fighting errors the doc caused.
- **Endpoints documented after deletion.** The API reference still lists `POST /v1/legacy-export`. The route was removed. A consumer integrates against it and gets a 404 in production.
- **Screenshots of an old UI.** The onboarding guide shows buttons and menus that no longer exist; the user can't find "the green Publish button" because it's now blue and in a different place.
- **Dead links.** "See the deployment guide [here]" — the link 404s because the page was renamed.
- **Superseded decisions presented as current.** A design doc says "we use polling"; the team switched to webhooks eight months ago, but the doc reads as if polling is the live design. A new engineer builds on a decision that was already reversed.
- **Drifted config docs.** The doc lists 12 config keys; the code now reads 20, three of the documented keys were renamed, and two were deleted.

Every one of these has the same shape: **a fact lived in two places — the system and the doc — and only one of them was updated.**

---

## Why Stale Docs Are Worse Than No Docs

This is the load-bearing argument of the whole topic, so let's make it precise.

When a doc is **missing**, you *know* it's missing. You don't trust it (it isn't there), so you fall back to the next-best source: read the code, ask a colleague, experiment. You lose a little time, but you're never *misled*.

When a doc is **wrong**, it looks authoritative. It's confident. It's formatted nicely. You follow it — and it lies to you. You don't find out until you've burned an hour, shipped a bug, or paged the on-call.

```
        MISSING DOC                          STALE DOC
  ┌─────────────────────┐            ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │ "There's nothing     │           │ "Here are the steps"      │
  │  here."              │           │  (but they're WRONG)      │
  └─────────┬───────────┘            └──────────┬───────────────┘
            │                                   │
   you KNOW to look elsewhere          you TRUST it and follow it
            │                                   │
     small, bounded cost                hidden cost: wasted hours,
     (ask / read code)                  bugs, incidents, broken trust
```

But the worst damage isn't the wasted hour — it's the **trust collapse**, which runs as a vicious loop:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    R[A doc is wrong] --> B[An engineer gets burned]
    B --> D["'The docs are always wrong'"]
    D --> S1[Stop reading docs]
    D --> S2[Stop updating docs]
    S1 --> M[More docs go stale, unnoticed]
    S2 --> M
    M --> R
```

Once "the docs are always wrong, don't bother" becomes the team's belief:

1. Engineers stop **reading** docs (so the docs provide zero value).
2. Engineers stop **updating** docs (because nobody reads them, why bother).
3. With nobody updating, *more* docs rot — which confirms the belief and tightens the loop.

A wrong doc therefore doesn't just fail to help; it **poisons the value of every other doc around it.** That's why "worse than nothing" is literal, not rhetorical. The entire fight against doc rot is a fight to keep this trust loop from ever starting.

---

## Why Docs Rot

Docs rot for structural reasons, not because engineers are lazy. Understand the causes and the cures become obvious.

| Cause | Why it leads to rot |
|---|---|
| **Docs live apart from the code** | A separate repo/wiki/tool means a code change and its doc change are two different chores, in two places, often by two people. The code one gets done; the doc one gets forgotten. |
| **No owner** | If nobody is responsible for a doc, nobody notices when it goes wrong. |
| **No trigger to update** | Nothing *forces* the doc to change when the code does. Updating it depends on someone *remembering*. |
| **Not in the Definition of Done** | If "the feature works" counts as done while the doc is untouched, the doc is structurally last and structurally skipped. |
| **No feedback when wrong** | A reader who hits a stale doc usually just sighs and moves on. The author never learns it broke. |
| **Write-once, never revisit** | Docs are treated as a one-time deliverable, not a living artifact. |
| **The asymmetry** | This is the deep one. **Code is tested and run constantly; prose just sits there, untested.** If you break the code, a test fails and CI goes red. If you break the truth of a doc, *nothing happens* — there's no failing test for "this sentence is now a lie." |

That last row is the key insight to carry into the rest of this topic. **Code can't silently rot, because it's exercised.** Docs silently rot precisely because they *aren't*. Every powerful anti-rot strategy works by closing that gap — making the doc exercised, generated, or co-located with the thing it describes, so it can no longer drift in silence.

---

## The Strategies, From Most to Least Powerful

There is a clear hierarchy. The higher strategies make rot *structurally impossible*; the lower ones merely make it *more visible*. Always reach for the highest one that fits.

```
   POWER  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   HIGH   │ 1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — generate the doc from the     │
          │    authoritative source. It CAN'T drift.                  │
          │ 2. EXECUTABLE / TESTED docs — examples run in CI; a       │
          │    broken example fails the build.                        │
          │ 3. DOCS NEXT TO CODE — same repo, same PR, reviewed &     │
          │    link-checked together.                                 │
          │ 4. OWNERSHIP & PROCESS — owners, Definition of Done, PR   │
          │    checklists make updating the doc someone's job.        │
          │ 5. FRESHNESS SIGNALS — last-reviewed dates, staleness     │
          │    bots, "report an error" — make rot VISIBLE.            │
   LOW    │ 6. DELETE / ARCHIVE — less doc surface = less to rot.     │
          └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 1. Single source of truth — generate, don't hand-write

The most powerful move: don't write the doc by hand at all. **Generate it from the thing that's already true.** If the doc is produced *from* the code/spec/schema, it literally cannot disagree with it.

- API reference → generated from the [OpenAPI spec or code](../04-api-and-reference-documentation/).
- CLI usage docs → generated from the argument parser itself.
- Config docs → generated from the config schema.
- [Changelog](../09-changelogs-and-release-notes/) → generated from commit history.
- Function/parameter docs → from [docstrings](../02-code-comments-and-docstrings/) next to the code.

**Generated beats hand-written wherever it's possible**, because a hand-written copy is a second place for the fact to live — i.e., a future stale doc.

### 2. Executable / tested docs

If a doc can't be generated, make its **examples run**. A "getting started" snippet, a usage example, a tutorial — turn them into tests (doctests, runnable code blocks executed in CI, tested onboarding scripts or containers). When the code changes and the example breaks, **the build goes red.** A doc that runs can't silently rot.

### 3. Docs next to code (docs as code)

Put the doc in the **same repository** as the code it describes, so a behavior change and its doc change land in the **same pull request**, reviewed together. Add automated link-checking and linting in CI. (This is the whole subject of [docs as code & tooling](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/).)

### 4. Ownership & process

Make updating the doc *someone's job and part of "done"*: `CODEOWNERS` for docs, "update the docs" as a checklist item on every PR, doc review as part of code review, and "docs updated" in the Definition of Done.

### 5. Freshness signals & feedback

When you can't prevent rot, make it *visible*: a `last_reviewed` date in each doc, a bot that flags docs not reviewed in N months, and a "Was this helpful? / Report an error" widget so readers can tell you when a doc is wrong.

### 6. Delete / archive ruthlessly

The cheapest doc to keep correct is the one that doesn't exist. **Out-of-date docs should be deleted or clearly marked archived/superseded** (an [ADR](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/) that's been replaced links to its successor and says so). Less doc surface area means less to rot. *Optimize for deletion.*

---

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Analogy |
|---|---|
| **Doc rot** | A wall calendar nobody flips — it confidently tells you it's still last March. |
| **Stale doc worse than none** | A road sign pointing to a bridge that washed out. No sign and you'd slow down and look; the *wrong* sign drives you off the edge at speed. |
| **Trust collapse** | A smoke alarm that cried wolf once too often — now everyone ignores it, including during the real fire. |
| **Single source of truth (generated)** | A digital clock wired to the atomic time signal — it can't show the wrong time because it doesn't *store* a separate guess. |
| **Executable docs** | A recipe you actually cook every night — if an ingredient is wrong, dinner fails immediately and you fix the recipe. |
| **Freshness date** | A "best before" stamp on food — it doesn't keep the milk fresh, but it tells you when to be suspicious. |
| **Delete ruthlessly** | Throwing out expired medicine instead of leaving it in the cabinet where someone might take it. |

---

## Mental Models

**The core intuition:** *Code can't lie for long because we run it. Docs lie quietly forever because we don't. Every fix to doc rot makes the doc more like code — generated from it, tested with it, or living right next to it.*

```
        ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  CODE  │ run + tested constantly → breaks LOUDLY → fixed │
  DOCS  │ never run, untested     → breaks SILENTLY → rots│
        └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   Anti-rot = drag docs UP into the "run / tested / co-located" world.
```

A second model — the **two-copies-of-a-fact** rule:

> Every time a fact lives in *two* places (the system and a hand-written doc), one of them will eventually be updated and the other won't. Rot is born the moment you make the copy. The fix is to keep **one** copy and *derive* the other.

---

## A Worked Example: Killing a Rotting Setup Doc

A README has a hand-written "Getting Started" that rots every few weeks as the project changes. Watch it climb the strategy hierarchy.

### Stage 0 — the rotting hand-written doc

```markdown
## Getting Started
1. Install Python 3.9
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set DB_URL in config.py
4. python run.py
```

The project upgraded to Python 3.12, moved to Poetry, renamed `DB_URL` to `DATABASE_URL`, and replaced `run.py` with a CLI. **Every step is now wrong.** A new hire follows it and loses a morning. This is rot: the steps are a hand-written *copy* of facts that live in the code, and the copy drifted.

### Stage 1 — make the steps executable (strategy 2)

Replace prose steps with a real, runnable setup script, and *run that exact script in CI*:

```bash
# scripts/setup.sh — the ONE place setup is defined
set -euo pipefail
poetry install
cp .env.example .env
poetry run app db migrate
poetry run app serve --check   # smoke test: process starts and health-checks
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/onboarding.yml — runs the real onboarding path nightly + on PRs
jobs:
  fresh-setup:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./scripts/setup.sh   # if onboarding breaks, THIS goes red
```

Now the README just says **"Run `./scripts/setup.sh`."** If anyone changes setup and forgets the script, CI fails — the doc *cannot* silently lie, because its single instruction is tested every day.

### Stage 2 — co-locate and link-check (strategy 3)

The README lives in the repo, in the same PR as code changes, and CI checks its links so a renamed page is caught immediately (covered in [docs as code](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/)).

### Stage 3 — a freshness signal as backstop (strategy 5)

For the parts that *must* stay prose (the "why", the architecture overview), add a review date so staleness becomes visible even when nothing tests it:

```markdown
---
last_reviewed: 2026-06-11
owner: platform-team
---
```

A bot can now flag this section if it hasn't been reviewed in six months. The freshness date doesn't *make* it fresh — it tells the team when to be suspicious (strategy 5 is the weakest tier for a reason).

**Result:** the rot-prone hand-written steps became a tested script (can't rot), and only the genuinely human "why" prose remains — guarded by a freshness signal. We climbed from the weakest defense to the strongest.

---

## Code Examples

### A doctest that fails CI when the code changes (Python)

The most direct anti-rot tool: an example *inside the docstring* that is executed as a test.

```python
def slugify(title: str) -> str:
    """Convert a title to a URL slug.

    >>> slugify("Hello, World!")
    'hello-world'
    >>> slugify("Keeping Docs ALIVE")
    'keeping-docs-alive'
    """
    return re.sub(r"[^a-z0-9]+", "-", title.lower()).strip("-")
```

```bash
# In CI:
python -m doctest -v mymodule.py     # FAILS if the example output no longer matches
```

If someone changes `slugify` to keep commas, the documented example `'hello-world'` no longer matches, the doctest **fails the build**, and the author is *forced* to either fix the code or update the doc. The example can't quietly become a lie.

### A README example tested in CI (any language)

```python
# tests/test_readme_examples.py — extract fenced ```python blocks from README.md and run them
import doctest, re, pathlib

def test_readme_python_blocks_run():
    readme = pathlib.Path("README.md").read_text()
    blocks = re.findall(r"```python\n(.*?)```", readme, re.S)
    for block in blocks:
        exec(compile(block, "README.md", "exec"), {})   # raises if the example is broken
```

Now a copy-paste example in the README is exercised on every PR. Break the API the example uses, and this test goes red.

### `CODEOWNERS` for docs — making updates someone's job (strategy 4)

```bash
# .github/CODEOWNERS
# Docs require review by the team that owns the relevant area.
/docs/api/            @backend-team
/docs/onboarding/     @platform-team
README.md             @platform-team
*.md                  @docs-maintainers   # catch-all so no doc is ownerless
```

Any PR touching these docs now *requires* an owning team's review — so a doc change isn't an afterthought, it's a gated, owned step.

### A staleness check in CI (strategy 5)

```python
# scripts/check_freshness.py — fail if any doc's last_reviewed is older than 180 days
import datetime, glob, sys, yaml

MAX_AGE_DAYS = 180
stale = []
for path in glob.glob("docs/**/*.md", recursive=True):
    text = open(path).read()
    if text.startswith("---"):
        front = yaml.safe_load(text.split("---")[1])
        reviewed = front.get("last_reviewed")
        if reviewed and (datetime.date.today() - reviewed).days > MAX_AGE_DAYS:
            stale.append(f"{path} (last reviewed {reviewed})")

if stale:
    print("Docs overdue for review:\n  " + "\n  ".join(stale))
    sys.exit(1)   # turns the CI/dashboard red until someone re-verifies
```

### A link-check step in CI (strategy 3)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/docs.yml
jobs:
  link-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2
        with:
          args: --no-progress './**/*.md'   # fails the build on any dead link
```

A renamed or deleted page is now caught the moment it breaks a link, instead of by a frustrated reader months later.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Generate before you write.** If a doc *can* be produced from code/spec/schema, generate it. A hand-written copy is a future stale doc.
2. **Make examples executable.** Doctests, tested README snippets, runnable onboarding scripts. A doc that runs in CI can't silently rot.
3. **Keep docs next to code, in the same PR.** A behavior change and its doc change should land together, reviewed together.
4. **Make updating the doc part of "done."** Add it to the Definition of Done and the PR checklist; assign owners with `CODEOWNERS`.
5. **Add freshness signals.** `last_reviewed` dates and a "report an error" link make rot visible when you can't prevent it.
6. **Delete ruthlessly.** Remove or clearly mark-as-superseded any doc you won't keep correct. Less surface, less rot.
7. **Treat a wrong doc as a bug.** When someone reports a stale doc, fix it like you'd fix a broken build — promptly, and at the source.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Believing "we just need to be more disciplined."** Relying on humans to *remember* to update docs is exactly what fails. Build structure (generation, tests, ownership), not willpower.
2. **Hand-writing what could be generated.** Copying API signatures or config keys into prose guarantees they'll drift.
3. **Leaving wrong docs up "until someone fixes them."** Every reader they mislead deepens the trust collapse. Delete or fix *now*.
4. **Treating docs as a one-time deliverable.** "Write the README at launch and never touch it" is the recipe for rot.
5. **Mistaking a freshness date for freshness.** A `last_reviewed` stamp that nobody acts on is theater — it makes the doc *look* maintained while it rots.
6. **Hoarding docs.** Keeping every doc forever multiplies the surface that can rot. Fewer, truer docs beat many stale ones.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Not everything can be generated.** Reference material (signatures, config, endpoints) can be generated; *explanation* — the "why", the architecture rationale, the trade-offs — needs a human and will always be rot-prone. Aim generation at the mechanical parts and guard the human parts with freshness signals and ownership.
- **Freshness dates can become theater.** A date that's bumped without a real re-verification is *worse* than none, because it falsely signals "trustworthy." The date must mean "a human actually checked this against reality on that day."
- **Over-aggressive deletion/expiry has its own cost.** A bot that auto-deletes anything over six months old will throw away stable, still-correct, high-value docs (a runbook for a rare incident is *supposed* to sit untouched). Expiry should *flag for review*, not silently delete.
- **The cost of maintenance must be weighed against the value of the doc.** A low-value doc that keeps rotting should be *deleted*, not endlessly repaired. Maintenance effort is finite; spend it on the docs that earn it.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Define doc rot and give three concrete examples.
2. Why is a stale doc *worse* than a missing one? Explain the trust-collapse loop.
3. Name the single deepest reason docs rot but code usually doesn't.
4. List the anti-rot strategies in order of power, and say which one makes rot *impossible* vs merely *visible*.
5. What does "single source of truth" mean for docs, and why is generated better than hand-written?
6. Why can a freshness date become "theater," and how do you prevent that?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THE CORE CLAIM
  A WRONG doc is WORSE than NO doc — it misleads, wastes time, and
  collapses trust ("the docs are always wrong → stop reading AND updating").

WHY DOCS ROT (the deep one)
  Code is RUN + TESTED → breaks loudly.  Prose just SITS there → rots silently.

STRATEGIES (strongest → weakest)
  1. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH   generate from code/spec/schema → can't drift
  2. EXECUTABLE / TESTED       doctests, CI-run examples → break the build
  3. DOCS NEXT TO CODE         same repo, same PR, link-checked & linted
  4. OWNERSHIP & PROCESS       CODEOWNERS, Definition of Done, PR checklist
  5. FRESHNESS SIGNALS         last_reviewed date, staleness bot, "report error"
  6. DELETE / ARCHIVE          less surface = less rot; mark superseded clearly

RULE OF THUMB
  Two copies of a fact (system + hand-written doc) → one WILL drift.
  Keep ONE copy; DERIVE the other.  Treat a wrong doc as a bug.
```

---

## Summary

- **Doc rot** is documentation drifting out of sync with reality; a **stale doc is worse than no doc** because it misleads with false authority and triggers a **trust collapse** where engineers stop both reading *and* updating docs.
- Docs rot for structural reasons — separated from code, no owner, no update trigger, not in the Definition of Done — and one deep one: **code is run and tested, prose isn't**, so docs break silently.
- The anti-rot strategies form a power hierarchy: **generate from a single source of truth** (1) and **make examples executable** (2) make rot impossible; **docs next to code** (3) and **ownership/process** (4) make updating it someone's job; **freshness signals** (5) make rot visible; **deleting ruthlessly** (6) shrinks the surface.
- Not everything can be generated (the "why" needs humans); freshness dates can become theater; over-aggressive deletion is its own failure. Match the effort to the doc's value — **delete the low-value ones rather than maintain them.**
