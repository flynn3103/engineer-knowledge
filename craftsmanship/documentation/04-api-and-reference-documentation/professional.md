# API & Reference Documentation — Professional

> **Category:** [Documentation](../README.md) — reference docs as a craft: the exhaustive, lookup-oriented description of an API's machinery, and the runnable examples and guides that make it usable.

## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — running reference docs as infrastructure for many APIs, many teams, over years.

Individually, every team agrees reference docs matter. Collectively, references rot: a field is added without a `description`, an example breaks and nobody notices, a breaking change ships because the spec wasn't diffed, v1 docs describe v2 behavior. No single lapse is unreasonable; the aggregate is a docs portal consumers no longer trust.

The professional question is operational: **how do you keep reference accurate and usable across dozens of APIs and hundreds of changes a week?** The answer is the same shape as for code quality — make the good path the default and enforce it in CI: a generation pipeline, spec governance with gates, examples tested in the build, review standards that catch the semantic gaps tools can't, and metrics that track the *outcome* (can a developer integrate without filing a ticket?) rather than vanity counts.

---

## The Reference Pipeline in CI/CD

Reference docs are **built artifacts**, treated like any other build output. A production pipeline, triggered on every change to a spec:

```text
ON CHANGE TO spec (openapi.yaml / schema.graphql / *.proto):
  1. LINT       spec passes style rules        (Spectral / Redocly / Buf lint)
  2. DIFF       no breaking change vs. released (oasdiff / GraphQL Inspector / buf breaking)
  3. EXAMPLES   doc-tests run & assert output   (every runnable example executes)
  4. CONTRACT   running service conforms to spec (Dredd / Pact / schemathesis)
  5. GENERATE   render reference                (Redoc / Swagger UI / Stoplight)
  6. PUBLISH    versioned docs site             (per-version, old versions kept live)
```

> The principle from [Docs as Code & Tooling](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/): **if it isn't in CI, it will rot.** A reference that regenerates and self-tests on every merge cannot describe a parameter the service doesn't have. A reference maintained by "remember to update the docs" cannot stay accurate at scale — willpower is not a pipeline.

The pipeline also makes documentation a **merge gate**: a PR that adds an undocumented endpoint, breaks an example, or introduces an undeclared breaking change *fails CI* and doesn't merge. Documentation quality becomes non-negotiable the same way passing tests is.

## Reviewing API Reference in Pull Requests

Tooling enforces structure; **review enforces meaning.** The reviewer's job is precisely the gaps a linter can't see.

### Review by layer

1. **Spec structure (tool-assisted):** Did lint pass? Does every new operation/field have a `description`? Are errors declared per response? If the linter is green, don't re-litigate style — focus on meaning.
2. **Semantics (human-only):** Does the `description` say what the linter can't infer — units (`amount` in cents), valid enum values *and what they mean*, side effects, idempotency, when each error fires and how to recover? "amount: the amount" is a lint-pass and a review-fail.
3. **Examples:** Is there a runnable example, and is it *realistic* (not `"string"` placeholders)? Does the doc-test cover it?
4. **Breaking change:** Did the diff tool flag anything? If so, is there a version bump, a deprecation path, and a changelog entry — or is this a silent break?
5. **Consistency with the rest of the API:** Same naming, same pagination shape, same error envelope as sibling endpoints? New inconsistency is a review-stop.

### The highest-value review questions

> **"What does a caller need to know about this field that its *type* doesn't already say?"** — forces real descriptions, not type echoes.

> **"Which errors can this endpoint return, and is each one documented with a recovery?"** — the unhappy path is where integrations get stuck.

> **"If a consumer pinned to the current version reads this, is it still true for them?"** — catches in-place mutation of versioned reference.

### Review comment templates

> "`status` is documented as `(string)` — that's just the type. List the values (`active | suspended | deleted`) and what each *means* for the caller."

> "This adds `POST /v1/exports` but declares no error responses. What happens on a bad request or rate-limit? Add them to the spec — undocumented errors are where integrations break."

> "oasdiff flagged `customer` as newly required — that's a breaking change. This needs a v2 (or making it optional with a default), a deprecation note on the old shape, and a changelog entry."

> "Example uses `amount: 0` and `email: \"string\"` — replace with a realistic, runnable payload so a reader can paste it and see a real response."

## Governing the Spec Across Many Teams

A single API is easy; **fifty APIs from twenty teams** is the professional reality, and consistency across them is what makes a platform feel like one product rather than fifty.

- **A published API style guide, encoded as lint rules.** The checkable parts (naming, pagination, error envelope, versioning header, required descriptions) become Spectral/Buf rules in a shared ruleset every repo extends. Consistency is *enforced*, not hoped for. (Public exemplars: Google AIP, Microsoft REST guidelines, Zalando's RESTful guidelines.)
- **A spec registry / catalog.** One place listing every service's spec and version (Backstage, an internal portal, SwaggerHub). Consumers discover APIs; the platform team sees coverage. (Tooling: Backend → API Documentation Tools.)
- **A golden-path template.** A starter repo with the spec scaffold, lint config, doc pipeline, and contract-test harness wired up, so a new service gets governed reference *for free* on day one. The simple path is the default path.
- **Federation for GraphQL / aggregation for REST.** A unified reference across services (Apollo Federation, a docs portal that ingests many specs) so consumers see one coherent reference, not fifty silos.

> The lesson that scales: **encode the standard once, enforce it in CI everywhere.** A style guide nobody can violate (because lint blocks the merge) beats a 40-page PDF nobody reads. Governance is automation, not documentation about documentation.

## Keeping Examples Correct at Scale

Examples are the highest-value and highest-maintenance content. At platform scale, only automation keeps them honest.

| Technique | How | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Generate from spec** | The "try-it" request is derived from OpenAPI | Baseline, every endpoint, free |
| **Snippet-from-tests** | Extract example code from passing integration tests at build time | Canonical per-endpoint examples |
| **Doc-tests in CI** | Examples *execute* and assert output on every build | Library/SDK examples |
| **Generated SDK + generated snippet** | SDK generated from spec; multi-language snippets call it | Multi-language reference (Stripe model) |
| **Synthetic-data fixtures** | Examples run against a sandbox with stable seeded data | Realistic, reproducible request/response pairs |

> The rule that ends the debate: **an example you don't execute is an example you will eventually ship broken.** If a snippet can't be tested or generated, it shouldn't be a documented example — cut the language or generate it. A broken example destroys trust faster than a missing one, because it fails *after* the developer committed to your API.

The economic decision is **how many languages to maintain.** Each added language multiplies the example surface. Stripe's 7 languages are justified by adoption ROI and *fully automated*; an internal API earns one generated `curl` example. Match the investment to the audience — gold-plating example coverage on a low-traffic internal API is waste.

## Measuring Reference Quality

Vanity metrics ("we documented 100% of endpoints") lie — a 100%-covered reference can be 100% type-echoes with no meaning, no examples, and broken links. Measure what predicts a developer *succeeding*.

| Metric | Tracks quality? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Endpoint/field doc coverage** | Weakly | Necessary floor; lint can gate it. But "has a description" ≠ "useful." |
| **Description-non-empty + non-trivial** | Partially | Lint for present *and* not just echoing the field name. |
| **Example coverage + example test pass rate** | **Yes** | Every endpoint has a *runnable, passing* example. |
| **Broken-link / broken-example rate in CI** | **Yes** | Drift made visible; should be zero. |
| **Spec-vs-server contract-test pass rate** | **Yes** | Ground truth that docs match reality. |
| **Time-to-first-successful-call (TTFSC)** | **Yes (outcome)** | How long from landing on docs to a working call — the real DX metric. |
| **Support tickets / forum questions per endpoint** | **Yes (outcome)** | High question volume on one endpoint = a reference gap there. |
| **Docs page → "was this helpful?" + search-with-no-result** | **Yes (outcome)** | Where readers get stuck. |

> The ground-truth question is **not "how much did we document?" but "can a developer integrate without filing a ticket?"** Time-to-first-successful-call and support-tickets-per-endpoint are downstream of reference quality; if they're bad, the reference is bad regardless of coverage %. Quality Engineering's Documentation Quality covers freshness gates and coverage metrics in depth; here the point is to *prefer outcome metrics over coverage vanity.*

## Deprecation and Sunset in the Reference

Removing things from a published API is where reference docs earn their keep — done in the reference, in the open, ahead of time.

```yaml
# OpenAPI: the reference IS where consumers discover a deprecation
/v1/charges/{id}/refund:
  post:
    deprecated: true
    summary: "[DEPRECATED] Refund a charge. Use POST /v1/refunds instead. Sunset: 2027-01-01."
```

```graphql
type Charge {
  refundUrl: String @deprecated(reason: "Use Refund.receiptUrl. Removed after 2027-01-01.")
}
```

The professional discipline:

1. **Mark it in the reference first** (`deprecated: true` / `@deprecated`) — generated docs then render the warning automatically.
2. **State the replacement and the sunset date** in the deprecation text, not just "deprecated."
3. **Emit a runtime `Deprecation` / `Sunset` HTTP header** so callers who never read docs still get warned (and the header points at the reference entry).
4. **Record it in the [changelog](../09-changelogs-and-release-notes/)** so the diff is discoverable.
5. **Never remove without the deprecation window having elapsed** for a published API — the reference is the contract, and silent removal breaks consumers you can't see.

> The triad again: the **reference** shows what's deprecated *now*; the **changelog** records *when* it was deprecated and removed; the **runtime header** reaches callers who don't read either. All three, for a one-way-door public API.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The "amount" that wasn't in cents

A payments API's reference documented `amount (integer, required)` with no unit. A large integrator read it, sent `amount: 50` meaning $50.00, and charged customers **50 cents**. Thousands of underbilled transactions before reconciliation caught it. **Root cause:** the `description` echoed the type and omitted the *meaning* (smallest currency unit). **Fix:** mandatory non-trivial descriptions on monetary fields, a lint rule rejecting descriptions that merely restate the field name, and a worked example showing `amount: 2000` → "$20.00". **Lesson:** the type is what the generator already knew; the unit is the knowledge only a human adds — and omitting it is a financial incident, not a typo.

### Incident 2: The example that hadn't run in a year

A popular SDK's quickstart example used a constructor signature removed two minor versions earlier. Every new developer's first copy-paste threw an error; many concluded the SDK was broken and left. The example had never been tested. **Fix:** all quickstart and reference examples became *extracted from passing integration tests* (snippet-from-tests) and run in CI; a broken example now fails the build. **Lesson:** an untested example is a time bomb that detonates on your newest, least-committed users — exactly the ones you can least afford to lose.

### Incident 3: The silent breaking change

A team made an optional response field required *in the request* and shipped it. The spec was regenerated (code-first) and docs updated to match — but there was no spec *diff* in CI, so nobody noticed it was breaking. Integrations that omitted the field started getting `400`s in production. **Fix:** added `oasdiff` breaking-change detection as a hard CI gate; a breaking change now requires an explicit version bump and a deprecation path or it can't merge. **Lesson:** "the docs match the code" is necessary but not sufficient — the docs (and code) can be *correctly documenting a break*. You need a diff gate, not just a generation step.

### Incident 4: The undocumented error nobody could recover from

A reference listed only `200` and `400` for an endpoint that, under load, also returned `429` with a `Retry-After` header. Consumers, seeing no documented `429`, treated it as a hard failure and didn't back off — amplifying the overload into an outage. **Fix:** lint rule requiring rate-limited endpoints to document `429` + `Retry-After` + recovery guidance; error responses became a mandatory part of every spec operation. **Lesson:** undocumented errors aren't a cosmetic gap — they cause *consumer behavior that worsens incidents.* The unhappy path is first-class.

---

## The Politics of Reference Docs

- **Docs are credited to no one and blamed on everyone.** The engineer who ships a feature gets the credit; the reference gap surfaces as a support ticket months later with no owner. Counter by making docs a *merge gate* (CI), so they're part of "done," not optional follow-up.
- **"DevRel will document it" is where reference goes to die.** The team that built the endpoint knows the semantics; a separate writer can't infer that `amount` is in cents. Owning teams write the spec descriptions; DevRel owns the guides/recipes layer on top.
- **Completeness is invisible; gaps are loud.** A perfect reference generates no praise; one missing error code generates an incident. Use outcome metrics (TTFSC, tickets-per-endpoint) to make the invisible value visible to stakeholders.
- **The spec is a contract, so it's a negotiation.** Design-first spec review *is* API design review across teams — treat it with that seriousness, because for a public API the reference *is* the product surface.

[ ] EXAMPLE    runnable + realistic (no "string"/0 placeholders) + covered by a doc-test
[ ] BREAKING   diff tool clean; any break has version bump + deprecation + changelog
[ ] VERSION    still true for a consumer pinned to the current version (no in-place mutation)

## Cheat Sheet

```text
PIPELINE        lint → diff(breaking) → run examples → contract-test → generate → publish(versioned)
                docs are a BUILT artifact and a MERGE GATE. Not in CI → it rots.

REVIEW          tools enforce STRUCTURE; humans enforce MEANING.
                "what does the caller need that the TYPE doesn't say?"
                "which errors, and how to recover from each?"

GOVERN          style guide AS LINT RULES (shared ruleset) · spec registry · golden-path template
                encode the standard once, enforce in CI everywhere

EXAMPLES        generate from spec OR extract from passing tests. Untested example = future break.
                # of languages = adoption ROI; automate or cut.

MEASURE         outcome > vanity. TTFSC + tickets-per-endpoint + contract-pass + broken-example-rate.
                NOT "100% documented" (can be 100% type-echoes).

DEPRECATE       reference (deprecated:true) + replacement + sunset date + runtime header + changelog.
                never remove a published-API element without the window elapsing.
```
