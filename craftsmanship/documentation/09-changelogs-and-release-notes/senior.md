## Introduction

> Focus: **design trade-offs** and **system-level reasoning**

At the senior level, changelogs and versioning stop being a documentation chore and become an **interface design problem**. A published version number is a *contract* with everyone who depends on you; a changelog is the *evidence* that you honored it; a release note is the *relationship management* with users. Get these wrong at scale and you don't just have stale docs — you have broken builds across an ecosystem, eroded trust, and a support queue full of "the upgrade broke us."

This file covers the hard questions a senior owns:

1. **What does the version number actually promise, and what counts as breaking it?** (Far subtler than "MAJOR = breaking.")
2. **How do versioning strategy and release cadence interact** with the changelog discipline?
3. **How does this scale** to monorepos, security advisories, and many audiences at once — and where does automation help versus hurt?

---

## The Version Number Is an API Contract

Semver's deepest idea: **the version number is a machine-readable promise**, and an entire dependency-resolution ecosystem is built on trusting it.

When a consumer writes `"widget": "^2.1.0"` (npm caret) or `widget = ">=2.1,<3"` (Python), they are saying: *"Auto-install any MINOR or PATCH up to, but not including, the next MAJOR — because semver promises those won't break me."* Their CI installs `2.4.7` at 3 a.m. without a human looking, **trusting your version number**. Range operators (`^`, `~`, `>=`) only make sense because semver is a contract.

```
Consumer declares:  ^2.1.0   means  >=2.1.0  <3.0.0
                    └─ "give me features & fixes, but never a breaking change
                        without me explicitly opting in by bumping the range"
```

The consequences are stark:

- **Ship a breaking change as a MINOR**, and you break every consumer auto-upgrading within the range — silently, at scale, without anyone choosing it. This is the cardinal sin of versioning.
- **Bump MAJOR for a non-breaking change**, and you strand consumers on the old version (their range won't auto-adopt `3.x`), splitting your user base and fragmenting your support.

> The version number is not a label you choose by feel. It is a *commitment* that downstream automation acts on without asking. Treating it casually breaks the trust the whole ecosystem runs on.

The senior corollary: **the changelog and the version must be consistent or the contract is a lie.** If the version says PATCH but the changelog (honestly) lists a breaking change, your tooling and your humans disagree — and consumers get hurt by whichever they trusted.

---

## What "Breaking" Actually Means — and Why It's Slippery

"MAJOR = breaking change" is the easy part. The hard part is that *breaking* is defined relative to the **observable contract**, which is broader than most engineers assume. A change can be breaking even when no signature changed:

| Subtle breaking change | Why it breaks consumers |
|---|---|
| **Tightening input validation** | Inputs that used to be accepted now error — code that relied on leniency breaks. |
| **Changing a default value** | Behavior shifts for everyone who relied on the default. |
| **Changing error type/message** | Code that catches/parses errors breaks (this is the "Hyrum's Law" trap). |
| **Adding a required field** to a response/event | Consumers parsing strictly may break; producers adding required *request* fields definitely break. |
| **Changing timing/ordering** | Async consumers relying on order break. |
| **Bug fixes consumers depended on** | If observable behavior changes, someone was relying on the bug. |
| **Stricter types** | Narrowing a type breaks callers passing the wider type. |

> **Hyrum's Law:** *with enough consumers, every observable behavior of your system — not just the documented contract — will be depended upon by somebody.* So "breaking" is empirically about what consumers observe, not only about what you documented.

The senior judgment is twofold. First, **define your public contract explicitly** — what is API and what is internal — so you have a defensible line for "this change isn't breaking, you were depending on internals." (Mark internals clearly: `_private`, `internal` packages, `@internal` annotations.) Second, **when in doubt, treat it as breaking.** Under-calling a break (shipping it as MINOR) costs you far more in ecosystem trust than over-calling one (an extra MAJOR). The asymmetry favors caution.

## Release Cadence and Versioning Strategy

Senior teams choose a *strategy*, not just a format. The main axes:

**Versioning schemes** (semver is dominant but not universal):

| Scheme | Form | When it fits |
|---|---|---|
| **SemVer** | `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` | Libraries/APIs with consumers who need compatibility promises. The default. |
| **CalVer** | `YYYY.MM` / `2026.06` | Products where "when" matters more than "compatibility" (Ubuntu, pip). Communicates recency, not compatibility. |
| **ZeroVer** | stuck on `0.x` forever | A (mostly tongue-in-cheek) anti-pattern; signals "no stability promise" indefinitely. |

The deep point: **semver and CalVer answer different questions.** Semver answers *"is this safe to upgrade?"*; CalVer answers *"how old is this?"*. A library chooses semver because consumers need the compatibility promise; an end-user application may choose CalVer because users care about freshness, not API stability.

**Release cadence** interacts with the changelog effort:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Continuous / on-merge<br/>semantic-release] --> A2[Many tiny releases<br/>changelog must be automated]
    B[Train / scheduled<br/>e.g. every 2 weeks] --> B2[Batched changelog<br/>room for a curation pass]
    C[Milestone / ad-hoc<br/>big MAJORs] --> C2[Hand-written notes<br/>+ migration guide are worth it]
```

- **Continuous release** (ship every merge) *requires* automation — no human can write notes per release. The changelog is necessarily mechanical.
- **Release trains** (fixed schedule) batch changes, which creates a natural window for a human curation pass and a coherent release narrative.
- **Milestone releases** (occasional, large) justify hand-crafted notes, a blog post, and a full migration guide — the effort amortizes over a big audience.

The strategy choice cascades: it determines whether your changelog *can* be hand-curated at all, and what your version numbers even mean.

---

## Monorepo and Multi-Package Changelog Complexity

The hardest changelog problem at scale is the **monorepo**: many independently-versioned packages in one repository. Now "what version is this?" and "what changed?" have *N* answers, not one.

The core difficulties:

- **A commit may touch multiple packages** — which one(s) does the change belong to? Per-commit parsing can't always tell.
- **Packages have independent versions.** `@acme/core` is at `4.2.0` while `@acme/cli` is at `1.7.3`; a single PR might bump one, both, or neither.
- **Internal dependency cascades.** If `@acme/core` makes a breaking change, every package depending on it must bump *and* get a changelog entry explaining the propagated change.

This is exactly what **changesets** is built for. Instead of inferring intent from commit messages, the *author* declares intent in a small file per PR:

```markdown
---
"@acme/core": minor
"@acme/cli": patch
---

Add streaming support to the core client; CLI now exposes `--stream`.
```

At release time, the tool aggregates all changesets, computes each package's correct bump, **propagates dependency bumps** (a `core` minor that `cli` depends on may force a `cli` patch), writes a *per-package* `CHANGELOG.md`, and versions each independently.

| Approach | Strength | Weakness |
|---|---|---|
| **Commit-message inference** (semantic-release per package) | No extra author work | Struggles to attribute a commit to the right package |
| **Intent files** (changesets) | Author states package + bump explicitly; handles cascades | Requires authors to remember the changeset file |

The senior takeaway: in a monorepo, **make the change-intent explicit per PR** (the changeset model) rather than reverse-engineering it from commits — the attribution and dependency-cascade problems make pure commit inference unreliable. The trade-off is one more file per PR, enforced in CI ("PR must include a changeset or explicitly mark itself as no-release").

## Security Advisories and CVE Linkage

Security changes are a distinct discipline layered on top of the changelog, because the audience and timing differ:

- **Coordinated disclosure:** you often fix *before* you disclose, to avoid handing attackers a roadmap. The changelog entry and the public advisory may be *delayed* relative to the patch, or released together at an embargo lift.
- **CVE linkage:** a security fix should reference its identifier — `CVE-2026-0011`, or a GitHub Security Advisory `GHSA-xxxx` — so vulnerability scanners (Dependabot, Snyk, OSV) can match it to consumers' lockfiles and alert them automatically.
- **Out-of-band releases:** security patches don't wait for the next scheduled release. They ship immediately, often as a PATCH to *every* currently-supported version line (`1.9.x`, `2.4.x`, `3.1.x`) — backported.

```markdown
### Security
- Fixed header-injection allowing request smuggling (CVE-2026-0011, GHSA-q8xk-...).
  Patched in 3.1.4, 2.4.9, and 1.9.12. **Upgrade immediately.**
```

The senior responsibility is to wire the changelog into the **machine-readable security ecosystem** (the GitHub Advisory Database / OSV feed), not just write prose — because that's what lets a consumer's `dependabot` open an upgrade PR the morning after you disclose. A security fix that isn't discoverable by scanners protects only the people who happen to read your changelog.

## The Automation-vs-Curation Decision, at System Scale

The middle level framed this as a per-project choice; at the senior level it's a *portfolio* decision shaped by audience and contract surface:

| Factor | Pushes toward **automation** | Pushes toward **curation** |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | Other developers / machines | End users / executives |
| Release frequency | High (continuous) | Low (milestones) |
| Contract surface | Internal / library API | Product features |
| Cost of a bad note | Low (devs can read code) | High (user confusion, support load) |
| Number of packages | Many (monorepo) | Few |

The mature stance: **automate the contract-keeping, curate the relationship.** The version bump and the precise change list are bookkeeping — let machines own them, because consistency with the contract is what matters and humans are unreliable at it. The *narrative* a user reads — what's exciting, what to watch out for, how to migrate — is relationship work; a human should own it. A team that automates everything ships technically-correct, unreadable notes; a team that hand-writes everything is inconsistent and slow. Split the responsibility along the contract/relationship line.

## Designing for the Audiences You Actually Have

One release event fans out to several artifacts, each tuned to an audience and channel. Designing this fan-out is a senior responsibility:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REL[One release] --> CL["CHANGELOG.md<br/>(developers, precise)"]
    REL --> GH["GitHub Release<br/>(devs, semi-narrative)"]
    REL --> MIG["Migration guide<br/>(devs crossing a break)"]
    REL --> BLOG["Blog / What's New<br/>(users, marketing)"]
    REL --> INAPP["In-app banner<br/>(users, one line)"]
    REL --> EMAIL["Email / advisory<br/>(users, security)"]
```

The design rules:

- **Single source of facts, multiple renderings.** All channels derive from one accurate change list; you reframe, you don't re-decide. Divergent facts across channels destroy trust.
- **Match register to channel.** The in-app banner is one sentence; the changelog is a precise list; the blog is a story. Same facts, different *level of detail and tone*.
- **Security gets its own urgent channel.** "Upgrade now" doesn't belong buried in a blog post; it needs the advisory + email + a pinned changelog entry.
- **Breaking changes get a dedicated guide**, linked from every other channel, never crammed into a one-liner.

The anti-pattern is publishing the raw, mechanical changelog to *every* channel — dumping `fix: handle nil pointer in pool (#1290)` into a user-facing "What's New" that no user can parse. Audience-fit is the whole job.

---

## "Nobody Reads Release Notes Until They Break"

A hard truth seniors must design around: **most consumers ignore your notes — right up until an upgrade breaks them, at which point the notes are the only thing standing between them and a support ticket.** This reality drives several design decisions:

- **Optimize the changelog for the *failure* moment, not the browsing moment.** The reader who matters most arrives *after* something broke, searching for "what changed in 3.0 and how do I fix it." Make breaking changes and migration steps the most prominent, most findable thing — not buried among features.
- **Make breakage loud and self-explaining.** Deprecation warnings *at runtime* (not just in the changelog) reach people who never read docs. A removed feature should fail with an error that *names the changelog/migration guide*.
- **Don't rely on humans reading to stay safe.** This is why security fixes must be machine-discoverable (CVE/OSV) — you cannot assume anyone read the Security section.

> Design the release notes as if the reader is angry, in a hurry, and arrived because something just broke — because that's your most important reader. Everything else is a bonus.

## Changelogs as Part of the Doc System

A senior treats the changelog not as a standalone file but as a node in the documentation system ([docs-as-code](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/senior.md)):

- **It lives in the repo and is reviewed in PRs** — the changelog entry (or changeset) is part of the *definition of done* for a change, gated in CI.
- **It cross-references the rest of the docs:** breaking entries link migration guides; the [README](../03-readmes-and-onboarding-docs/senior.md) links the changelog; [versioned reference docs](../04-api-and-reference-documentation/senior.md) align with the version line the changelog describes.
- **It is a primary weapon against [doc rot](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/senior.md):** because it's written *with* the change (or generated *from* the change), it can't drift the way after-the-fact docs do. A changelog generated from commits is, by construction, never stale.

The system view: the changelog is where *what changed* is recorded once and propagated everywhere — reference docs, release notes, advisories, the README's "latest version" badge. Treating it as the single source of change-truth is what keeps the whole doc set consistent across versions.

## Liabilities

### Liability 1: A version number that lies

Shipping a breaking change as a MINOR/PATCH (or to satisfy a green CI) breaks the contract every consumer's dependency resolver trusts — silently, at ecosystem scale. The most expensive mistake in the topic. Audit "is this breaking?" against the *observable* contract (Hyrum's Law), not just signatures.

### Liability 2: Automation that ships nonsense

Fully automated notes are only as good as commit messages. `fix: stuff` becomes a worthless changelog line that a customer reads. Without a human gate on user-facing notes, you publish mechanically-correct, humanly-useless releases.

### Liability 3: Removal without a deprecation window

Deleting a feature that was never deprecated — no warning, no timeline, no migration guide — is the trust-killer. Even a correct MAJOR bump doesn't excuse skipping the deprecation runway for anything widely used.

### Liability 4: Security fixes invisible to scanners

A patched CVE with no CVE/GHSA linkage protects only the handful of people who read your changelog. The fix exists; the *discoverability* doesn't; consumers stay vulnerable. Wire releases into the advisory ecosystem.

### Liability 5: Monorepo changelog drift

In a monorepo, inferring per-package bumps from commits mis-attributes changes and misses dependency cascades, producing per-package changelogs that are subtly wrong. Use explicit intent (changesets) and enforce it in CI.

## Pros & Cons at the System Level

| Dimension | Automated (commits → tool) | Hand-curated |
|---|---|---|
| Consistency with the version contract | **High** — version always matches commits | Depends on discipline |
| Effort at scale | Near zero | Grows with release count |
| Readability for users | Low — mechanical | **High** if written well |
| Correctness in monorepos | Needs changeset-style intent files | Hard to keep consistent by hand |
| Security/advisory integration | Strong (tooling links CVEs) | Manual, easy to forget |
| Narrative / relationship value | Weak | **Strong** |
| Best for | Libraries, monorepos, high cadence, dev audience | Products, milestones, user audience |

The system stance: **automate the parts that must be consistent with the contract (version, change list, advisory linkage) and curate the parts that build a relationship (the narrative, the migration guide).** This split — not "automate everything" or "write everything by hand" — is what scales across many packages, audiences, and release cadences without either lying to consumers or boring them.
