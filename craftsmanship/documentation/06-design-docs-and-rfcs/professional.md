## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — running the design-doc/RFC process across many teams over years.

A design doc is easy for one engineer to write. An *RFC process that hundreds of engineers actually use, that improves decisions, and that doesn't collapse into theater or bureaucracy* is an organizational system you have to design and maintain like any other.

At the professional level the question is operational: **how do you run a design-doc/RFC practice at org scale so that the right decisions get the right scrutiny, decisions actually get made, the durable knowledge survives, and engineers don't come to resent the process?** The answer is a system: a template that encodes the senior reasoning, tooling that keeps docs discoverable, metrics that detect when the process is degrading, a decider model that scales, and a disciplined pipeline from doc to ADR.

---

## Standing Up an RFC Process That Survives

Most internal RFC processes either never get adopted or calcify into bureaucracy. The ones that survive share a few design choices:

1. **Make the lightweight path genuinely lightweight.** If the *minimum* RFC is a 10-section template with three required approvers, people route around it. The minimum viable RFC should be a one-pager with one decider and a 3-day window. Heavy process is *opt-up* for one-way doors, not the default.
2. **One obvious home.** RFCs live in *one* place everyone knows (a `rfcs/` directory in a repo, or one wiki space) — not scattered across personal docs, Slack, and email. Discoverability is adoption.
3. **A template that's a checklist, not a chore.** Empty `## Non-Goals` and `## Alternatives Considered` headings do the teaching; people fill what's in front of them.
4. **A named owner for the process itself.** Someone owns "the RFC process" the way someone owns CI — keeps the template current, unblocks stalled RFCs, reports on health.
5. **Visible wins early.** The first few RFCs should be real decisions that visibly went better *because* of the process (a risk caught, a cross-team conflict resolved in writing). Adoption follows demonstrated value, not mandate.

> The failure mode of a new RFC process is not "too few rules" — it's "too much ceremony for the common case." Optimize the *default* path for speed; reserve weight for the one-way doors.

## The Org-Wide Template

A shared template encodes the senior reasoning so every author gets it approximately right and every reviewer cites a standard, not a preference. A production-grade template:

```markdown
---
RFC: <number>
Title: <imperative, specific>
Author: <name>
Status: Draft            # Draft | In Review | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded
Created: <date>
Review-by: <date>        # comment period closes — REQUIRED
Decider: <@handle>       # the single accountable shepherd — REQUIRED
Reviewers: <@required-approvers>
Supersedes / Superseded-by: <RFC #>
Tracking: <issue link>
---

# <Title>

## Context / Background
Why now? What problem, what prompted it. Written for a reader cold to it.

## Goals
- <measurable outcome>      # few and sharp; the design is held to these

## Non-Goals
- <deliberately out of scope>   # pre-answers "can it also...?"

## Proposed Design
Overview (2 sentences) → details: data model, APIs, key flows, a diagram.

## Alternatives Considered
### A. <chosen> — pros / honest cons
### B. <genuinely-tempting rejected> — specific, falsifiable why-rejected
### C. <rejected> — why

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Security:        <attack surface, authz>
- Privacy:         <PII, retention>
- Observability:   <metrics, logs, traces, alerts, SLOs>
- Testing:         <strategy, the hardest thing to test>
- Rollout/Migration: <flag, phases, data migration, ROLLBACK plan>
- Cost:            <run cost at expected + peak scale>

## Open Questions
- <unresolved; explicitly want input>

## Timeline
Rough phases / milestones.

## Decision
<filled at close: outcome + the reasoning. This becomes the ADR seed.>
```

The two most-skipped, most-enforced fields remain **`Review-by`** (makes the comment period close) and **`Decider`** (makes a decision possible). The `## Decision` block at the bottom is the *seed of the ADR* — the durable record is half-written by the time the RFC closes.

---

## Tooling and Where Docs Live

The "where" determines whether docs get reviewed and found later. Two viable models:

| Model | Mechanism | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Docs in the repo** (PR-based RFC) | RFC is a markdown file; review *is* a pull request | Versioned, diffable, lives next to code, inline comments, CI can lint it | Reviewers must use the repo; less friendly to non-engineers |
| **Shared doc tool** (Google Docs / Notion / Confluence) | RFC is a doc with inline comments | Easy for anyone to comment; rich formatting; familiar | Not versioned with code; drifts; weaker change history |

Many orgs use **the repo for engineering RFCs** (the diffable history and CI integration are worth it — this is the *docs-as-code* approach; see [Docs as Code & Tooling](../10-docs-as-code-and-tooling/)) and a doc tool for proposals that need broad non-engineer input.

Whichever you pick, automate what you can:
- **Lint the template** — CI rejects an RFC missing `Decider`, `Review-by`, Non-Goals, or Alternatives.
- **Diagrams as code** — embed Mermaid/PlantUML so diagrams are diffable and reviewable, not screenshots that rot (see [Diagrams as Code](../08-diagrams-as-code/)).
- **Status automation** — a bot that nudges stalled "In Review" RFCs past their `Review-by` date and pings the decider.
- **A discoverable index** — an auto-generated list of all RFCs with status, so the corpus is navigable.

## Metrics: Measuring a Healthy Process

You manage what you measure — and the wrong metric corrupts the process. Choose metrics that detect the [senior-level failure modes](senior.md) (theater, paralysis, over-process), not vanity counts.

| Metric | What it tells you | Watch for |
|---|---|---|
| **Time-in-review (median)** | Is the process timely? | Rising → paralysis; near-zero → rubber-stamping |
| **% of RFCs that change after first draft** | Is review *substantive*? | Near 0% → **theater** (nobody really reviewing) |
| **% rejected or significantly redirected** | Is "no" a real outcome? | 0% rejected → docs are sales pitches, not explorations |
| **RFCs stuck past `Review-by`** | Decider/ownership health | Any growing backlog → diffused ownership |
| **Comments per RFC from *required* reviewers** | Are the right people engaging? | Low → wrong reviewers, or theater |
| **RFC → ADR conversion** | Are decisions being banked durably? | Low → knowledge evaporating |
| **Incidents traceable to a skipped doc** | The ground truth | Each one → a one-way door that dodged process |

### The honest-measurement rules

- **A doc that never changes during review is the alarm, not the goal.** The most dangerous "green" metric is a fast, frictionless review where nothing ever changes — that's *theater*, and it produces the same outcome as having no process while costing more.
- **Never reward authors for RFC *count*.** Counting docs produced incentivizes docs for things that didn't need them (over-process) — the opposite of the goal. Reward decisions made well.
- **Zero rejections is a red flag, not a triumph.** If no RFC is ever rejected or substantially redirected, either the process is a rubber stamp or authors only propose pre-blessed ideas. A healthy process kills some proposals — cheaply, in review.
- **The real outcome metric is downstream:** are major decisions sound, made on time, and traceable later? An RFC process that prevents wrong builds and leaves an ADR trail is working, regardless of throughput.

---

## Scaling the Decider Role

A single shepherd per RFC works until volume outgrows any one person. At scale, the decider model itself has to scale:

- **Delegate by domain.** Map decision areas to owners — the storage team decides storage RFCs, the API council decides public-API RFCs. The author knows who their decider is *before* writing.
- **A tech-leads / architecture group for cross-cutting RFCs.** Decisions that span domains go to a small standing group with a chair who breaks ties. (Beware turning this into a slow, gatekeeping "architecture board" — it must *enable* decisions, not bottleneck them.)
- **Default-decider rules to prevent limbo.** "If no decider is named within 2 days, the author's manager is the decider." Removes the most common stall cause.
- **Escalation path, not escalation default.** Most RFCs decided at team level; only genuine cross-team conflicts escalate. If everything escalates, you've recentralized and recreated the bottleneck.

> The decider model scales by *distributing* decision authority to domain owners, not by funneling everything through one architecture board. Centralized deciding is how RFC processes become the bureaucracy engineers route around.

## The Doc/RFC/ADR Pipeline in Production

In production, the pipeline must run reliably, or the durable knowledge leaks. The discipline:

```text
1. PROPOSE   author writes RFC from the template (Draft)
2. REVIEW    publish, tag required reviewers, time-boxed comment period
3. DECIDE    shepherd synthesizes, calls it, fills the ## Decision block
4. RECORD    the Decision block becomes an ADR (durable, one page)
5. PLAN      accepted design → tickets, milestones, owners
6. BUILD     implement; the RFC now begins to go stale (expected)
7. ARCHIVE   mark RFC Implemented/Superseded; ADR remains the live record
```

The load-bearing step teams skip is **(4) RECORD**. An accepted RFC with no ADR means that two years on, when the RFC has gone stale and half the authors have left, the *why* is gone. The ADR is the durable distillate; the RFC is the (perishable) full discussion. (See [ADRs](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/).)

A production refinement: **bake ADR creation into the RFC close.** When the shepherd marks an RFC Accepted, the template's `## Decision` block *is* the ADR draft — copy it into the ADR log, link both ways, done. Don't leave it as a "someone should write an ADR" todo that never happens.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The schema decided in a stand-up
A team chose an event schema in a 15-minute stand-up — "we'll just nest the payload, ship it." No doc, no review. Six months and three consuming teams later, a required field couldn't be added without a breaking change, and the nested shape made versioning brutal. The migration touched four services and took a quarter. **Postmortem:** an event schema is a *one-way door* — exactly the decision an RFC exists to catch. A 30-minute review would have surfaced the versioning problem for the price of a comment. **Lesson:** match process to *reversibility*, not to how quick the decision *feels.*

### Incident 2: Death by comment period
An RFC for a new internal platform sat "In Review" for seven weeks. Every round of comments spawned new alternatives; the author kept expanding the doc; no one was empowered to call it. Three engineers were effectively blocked the whole time. **Postmortem:** no named decider and no `Review-by` date — textbook analysis paralysis. **Fix:** assigned a decider, set a hard 3-day final window, shipped a decision. **Lesson:** a comment period without a deadline and a decider is a black hole. Time-box and name the shepherd.

### Incident 3: The strawman alternatives
A staff engineer's RFC proposed a custom framework; the Alternatives section listed three off-the-shelf options, each dismissed in one line ("too heavy", "not flexible", "wrong language"). It was approved — the seniority lent it weight. The framework took two quarters, then was abandoned for one of the "dismissed" off-the-shelf options, which fit fine. **Postmortem:** decision-laundering — the alternatives were strawmen, and rank substituted for scrutiny. **Lesson:** review bar scales with *reversibility, not seniority*; a senior reviewer should have rejected the doc for un-serious alternatives.

### Incident 4: The doc treated as living truth
A new hire found a two-year-old design doc in the wiki and built a new feature against its described architecture — which had been substantially rebuilt a year prior. The doc had no date or status. Days of work targeted a system that no longer existed. **Postmortem:** a design doc was mistaken for a reference doc. **Lesson:** design docs are *point-in-time*; date and status them, route current truth to reference docs and ADRs, and *expect* design docs to go stale (see [Keeping Docs Alive & Doc Rot](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/)).

---

## The Politics of Process

Running the process well is partly a social problem:

- **Process is easy to over-sell and over-impose.** A leader who mandates RFCs for everything gets malicious compliance — docs written to satisfy the rule, not to think. Sell the *value* (better decisions, fewer wrong builds), apply it to one-way doors, and let demonstrated wins drive adoption.
- **Rejecting an RFC must be safe and normal.** If "your RFC was rejected" is a black mark, authors stop surfacing risky-but-honest proposals and only float safe ones. Frame early rejection as the process *working* — a wrong build prevented cheaply.
- **Senior authors get *more* scrutiny, not less.** The instinct to wave through a staff engineer's doc is exactly how senior mistakes become incidents (Incident 3). Tie scrutiny to reversibility; protect reviewers who challenge senior authors.
- **The process owner must defend the lightweight path.** There's constant pressure to add "just one more required section/approver." Each addition taxes every future RFC. Guard the default path's lightness as fiercely as you guard the one-way-door rigor.

## Review Checklist

```text
DESIGN-DOC / RFC REVIEW CHECKLIST
[ ] CONTEXT — could a cold reader understand the problem and why now?
[ ] SCOPE   — Goals measurable & few; Non-Goals fence off scope creep
[ ] DESIGN  — overview then detail; a diagram for any non-trivial flow
[ ] ALTERNATIVES — ≥1 GENUINELY-tempting option, falsifiable why-rejected
[ ] ALTERNATIVES — chosen option's cons stated honestly (not a sales pitch)
[ ] CROSS-CUTTING — security · privacy · observability · testing · rollback · cost
[ ] OPEN QUESTIONS — honest uncertainties surfaced, not hidden
[ ] REVERSIBILITY — one-way door? → this scrutiny is warranted; two-way? → lighten up
[ ] PROCESS — named Decider + hard Review-by date present
[ ] REQUIRED REVIEWERS — the teams that own affected systems are tagged
[ ] DECISION → ADR — the close will produce a durable ADR, not just an approval
[ ] POINT-IN-TIME — doc is dated/status'd; not mistaken for a living reference
```

## Cheat Sheet

```text
RUN THE PROCESS   lightweight DEFAULT path (1 pager, 1 decider, 3 days);
                  heavy process is OPT-UP for one-way doors only

TEMPLATE          enforce Decider + Review-by (CI lint); empty Non-Goals &
                  Alternatives headings teach by being there

WHERE DOCS LIVE   ONE home; repo (diffable, CI-linted, docs-as-code) for
                  eng RFCs; doc tool for broad non-eng input

METRICS           % of RFCs that CHANGE in review (low = theater) ·
                  time-in-review (high = paralysis) · % rejected (0% = rubber
                  stamp) · RFC→ADR conversion · NOT raw RFC count

DECIDER           distribute by domain; default-decider rule kills limbo;
                  escalation is a PATH, not the default

PIPELINE          propose → review → DECIDE → RECORD(ADR) → plan → build →
                  archive.  Don't skip RECORD — bank the 'why' in an ADR.

INCIDENTS         schema in a stand-up (one-way door, no process) ·
                  7-week comment period (no decider/deadline) ·
                  strawman alternatives (rank > scrutiny) ·
                  stale doc as truth (point-in-time mistaken for reference)
```
