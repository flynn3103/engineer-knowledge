# Design Docs & RFCs — Junior

> **Category:** [Documentation](../README.md) — writing a short proposal *before* building, so the team can review the plan while it's still cheap to change.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What is it?** and **How to use it?**

A **design doc** (also called a *technical design document* or *tech spec*) is a short written description of *what you intend to build and how*, written **before** you build it, and shared so other people can read it and react. An **RFC** ("Request for Comments") is the same idea wrapped in a lightweight *process*: you publish the proposal, open a comment period, collect feedback, revise, and end with a decision.

> A design doc / RFC is written **before** building, to **align stakeholders, surface risks, and get review while the work is still cheap to change.**

That last phrase is the whole point. The cheapest moment to discover that your plan is wrong is *before* you've written 4,000 lines of code around it. A reviewer who spots a missing edge case, a security hole, or a simpler approach in your two-page doc just saved a week of implementation and a painful rewrite. The doc moves the expensive "you built the wrong thing" conversation from *after* the work to *before* it.

### Why this matters

Code tells you *what* the system does. A design doc tells you *why it exists, what we considered, and what we deliberately chose not to do* — and it does so at a moment when changing the plan costs minutes, not months. It is also how decisions get made *visibly*: instead of three people agreeing in a hallway, the proposal is written down where the whole team (and future-you) can see the reasoning. (For the broader "why document at all" question, see [Why & What to Document](../01-why-and-what-to-document/).)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can describe a feature in plain English — what it does and roughly how.
- **Required:** Basic familiarity with your team's review tools (a shared doc, a wiki page, or a pull request).
- **Helpful:** Exposure to [Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/) — the durable record a design doc often produces.
- **Helpful:** Comfort sketching a simple diagram (see [Diagrams as Code](../08-diagrams-as-code/)); design docs lean heavily on diagrams.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Design doc** | A written plan for a feature/system, produced before building, describing the approach, alternatives, and risks. |
| **RFC** | "Request for Comments" — a proposal published with a structured comment period and an explicit accept/reject decision. |
| **ADR** | "Architecture Decision Record" — a short, durable record of *one decision* and its rationale (see [05](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/)). |
| **Goals / Non-Goals** | What this work *will* achieve, and — just as important — what it explicitly *will not* try to do. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | The other approaches you weighed and *why you rejected each*. |
| **Shepherd / decider** | The person responsible for driving an RFC to a decision and resolving disagreement. |
| **Comment period** | A time-boxed window during which reviewers leave feedback on a proposal. |
| **Disagree and commit** | Once a decision is made, even those who argued against it support it and move on. |
| **Doc rot** | When a document drifts out of sync with reality and becomes misleading (see [11](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/)). |

## Why Write Anything Before Coding?

It feels faster to just start coding. For anything beyond a small, obvious change, it usually isn't. A design doc buys you four concrete things:

1. **Alignment.** Everyone who will be affected — your teammates, the team that owns the database you'll write to, the on-call engineer who'll be paged — agrees on the plan *before* the plan is set in code.
2. **Risk surfacing.** Reviewers spot the security issue, the scaling cliff, the broken edge case while it's a sentence to fix, not a deployed incident to roll back.
3. **A reviewable decision trail.** Six months later, when someone asks "why did we do it this way?", the answer is written down — with the alternatives you rejected and why.
4. **Less wasted implementation.** The most expensive code is the code you write and then throw away because it solved the wrong problem.

```mermaid

    D --> E[Build the agreed thing]
    A -.->|"skip the doc"| F[Build something]
    F -.-> G[Discover it's wrong]
    G -.-> H[Expensive rewrite]
```

The top path catches mistakes when they cost a comment. The bottom path catches them when they cost a rewrite.

## "Writing Is Thinking"

Here is the part that surprises new engineers: **the act of writing the doc is often more valuable than the doc itself.**

When an idea lives only in your head, it can feel complete while hiding huge gaps. The moment you try to write it down in full sentences — "the request comes in, then we look up the user, then we…" — you are forced to confront the questions you'd been skating over. *What happens if the user doesn't exist? Where does this data live? What if two requests arrive at once?* Vague hand-waving collapses the instant it has to become a sentence.

> "Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is." — Dick Guindon

This is why teams insist on design docs even for work that one person will build alone: writing the doc *forces clarity and exposes gaps* before they become bugs. The doc is, first and foremost, a **thinking tool** — and only second, an artifact you keep.

A practical consequence: don't treat the design doc as paperwork you produce after you've already decided everything. Write it *while* you're still figuring the design out. The half-finished doc that makes you go "…wait, how *does* that case work?" has already paid for itself.

## The Anatomy of a Design Doc

There is no single official format, but the widely-copied **Google-style design doc** has a well-worn shape. You don't need every section every time — but these are the ones a reviewer expects to find:

| Section | What goes here |
|---|---|
| **Context / Background** | Why are we doing this *now*? What problem, what prompted it. Enough for a reader cold. |
| **Goals & Non-Goals** | What success looks like — and what is explicitly out of scope. |
| **Design (overview + detailed)** | The proposed approach. A high-level sketch first, then the specifics: data model, APIs, key flows. |
| **Alternatives Considered** | Other approaches you weighed, and **why each was rejected.** |
| **Cross-cutting concerns** | Security, privacy, observability, testing, rollout/migration, cost. |
| **Open Questions** | What you haven't resolved yet and want input on. |
| **Timeline** | Rough phases / milestones (kept loose at this level). |

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CTX[Context / Background] --> G[Goals & Non-Goals]
    G --> D[Design: overview → detailed]
    D --> ALT[Alternatives Considered]
    ALT --> CC[Cross-cutting:<br/>security · privacy · observability ·<br/>testing · rollout · cost]
    CC --> OQ[Open Questions]
    OQ --> TL[Timeline]
```

A reviewer reads top to bottom: *I understand the problem → I know what's in and out of scope → I see the plan → I see you considered other plans → I see you thought about the hard cross-cutting stuff → I know what's still open.*

## The Two Highest-Value Sections

If you learn nothing else from this topic, learn this: **Goals/Non-Goals** and **Alternatives Considered** are the two sections that pay for the whole doc. Engineers love writing the "Design" section (it's the fun part) and skipping these two. That's backwards.

### Goals & Non-Goals

**Goals** state what the work must achieve — ideally measurable ("p99 latency under 200 ms", not "make it fast"). **Non-Goals** are the secret weapon: they state what you are *deliberately not doing.*

Non-Goals prevent scope creep ("can it also do X?" — "X is a non-goal, see the doc"), set reviewer expectations (a reviewer won't ding you for missing something you explicitly excluded), and force *you* to draw a boundary around the work. A doc without Non-Goals invites every reader to imagine a different, bigger project.

### Alternatives Considered

This is where you list the *other* approaches and **say why you rejected each one.** It matters for two reasons:

- It proves you didn't just grab the first idea that came to mind — you weighed options.
- It saves the next person (often future-you) from re-litigating a path you already ruled out. "Why didn't we just use a queue?" → "See Alternatives Considered: a queue was rejected because…"

A design doc with a thoughtful Alternatives section is the single strongest signal of an engineer who thinks before building.

## A Filled Design-Doc Excerpt

Here's what those two sections look like filled in, for a concrete feature: *adding password-reset-by-email to a web app.*

```markdown
## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- A user who forgot their password can regain access using only their email.
- A reset link is single-use and expires after 30 minutes.
- The flow leaks no information about whether an email is registered.

### Non-Goals
- Account recovery for users who lost access to their email (separate project).
- SMS / phone-based reset (no requirement today; revisit if support volume grows).
- Rate-limiting infrastructure — we will reuse the existing per-IP limiter, not build a new one.

## Alternatives Considered

### A. Email a 6-digit code (chosen)
A short-lived code emailed to the user, entered on the reset page.
+ Familiar UX; no link-handling edge cases (email clients mangling URLs).
+ Code can be rate-limited and locked after N attempts.

### B. Email a magic reset link (rejected)
A signed URL the user clicks to land on the reset form.
- Links are forwarded, logged by proxies, and previewed by scanners — the
  scanner's "click" can consume a single-use token before the user does.
- Rejected: the token-consumed-by-scanner failure mode is hard to mitigate cleanly.

### C. Security questions (rejected)
"What was your first pet?"
- Low-entropy, often discoverable, and a known weak factor.
- Rejected on security grounds outright.
```

Notice how much *the rejections* tell you. A reader now understands not just the plan but the *reasoning* — and can challenge it precisely ("actually, scanner-click is solvable with a confirmation step") instead of vaguely.

## What Is an RFC?

**RFC** stands for **"Request for Comments."** The term comes from the **internet's own beginnings**: in **1969, Steve Crocker** wrote the first RFC (RFC 1) to document early ARPANET design decisions. He chose the deliberately humble name "Request for Comments" to keep the tone open and non-authoritative — *here's a proposal, please comment* — rather than handing down edicts. The internet's core protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS) are still published as IETF RFCs to this day.

Companies and open-source projects borrowed the idea for **internal RFC processes** — a structured way to propose a significant change and gather feedback before committing:

- **Rust** uses RFCs for language changes ([rust-lang/rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)).
- **Python** has **PEPs** (Python Enhancement Proposals) — same concept, different name.
- Companies like **Uber, Squarespace, and many others** run internal RFC processes for cross-team technical proposals.

The core idea: instead of deciding in a meeting that excludes most stakeholders, you **write the proposal down and open it for structured, asynchronous comment.** Everyone affected can read it on their own time, leave feedback in context, and the decision is made in the open with a record of *why.* (You'll see the full RFC lifecycle and review process at the [Middle](middle.md) and [Senior](senior.md) levels.)

## Design Doc vs RFC vs ADR

These three are easy to confuse. They are **not competitors — they're a pipeline.** The cleanest way to keep them straight:

| | **Design Doc** | **RFC** | **ADR** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Question it answers** | *How will we build this?* | *Should we do this — what do you all think?* | *What did we decide, and why?* |
| **Audience** | Often a team / reviewers | Broad — anyone affected | Anyone, later |
| **Process weight** | Light–medium | Medium–heavy (comment period, decider) | Very light |
| **Lifespan** | Point-in-time (goes stale after build) | Point-in-time (archived after decision) | **Durable** (kept forever, can be superseded) |
| **Size** | 1–20 pages | 1–10 pages | ~1 page |

The relationship as a flow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    DD["Design Doc / RFC<br/>(the detailed plan,<br/>opened for comment)"] --> REV["Review &<br/>comment period"]
    REV --> DEC{Decision}
    DEC --> ADR["ADR<br/>(durable record<br/>of the decision)"]
```

In plain words: a **design doc** is the detailed plan; an **RFC** is that plan *explicitly opened for broad comment and a decision*; and an **ADR** is the short, lasting record of the decision that comes out the other end. You write the design doc/RFC to *make* the decision; you write the ADR to *remember* it. (ADRs are covered in depth in [05](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/).)

---

## Right-Sizing the Doc

A design doc is a tool, not a ritual. **Match the size of the doc to the size of the risk.**

| Change | Right-sized doc |
|---|---|
| Rename a config key | No doc — just the PR. |
| Add a field to an existing endpoint | A paragraph in the PR description. |
| New internal service or significant feature | A one-to-three-page design doc. |
| Cross-team change, new data model, irreversible decision | A full RFC with a comment period. |
| Company-wide standard or platform choice | A heavyweight RFC, multiple reviewers, a decider. |

The cost of a design doc must stay below the cost of getting the decision wrong. A one-pager for a small feature is great; a 20-page doc for a config rename is *design-doc theater* — process for its own sake. (More on right-sizing and when a quick spike beats a doc at [Middle](middle.md).)

## A Minimal Template You Can Copy

```markdown
# Design Doc: <Title>

**Author:** <you>   **Status:** Draft   **Last updated:** <date>
**Reviewers:** <names>

## Context / Background
What problem are we solving, and why now?

## Goals
- <measurable outcome>

## Non-Goals
- <explicitly out of scope>

## Proposed Design
Overview (the 2-sentence version), then the details:
data model, APIs, key flows, a diagram.

## Alternatives Considered
### Option A (chosen) — pros / cons
### Option B (rejected) — why rejected
### Option C (rejected) — why rejected

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
Security · Privacy · Observability · Testing · Rollout/Migration · Cost

## Open Questions
- <things you want input on>

## Timeline
Rough phases.
```

Start every doc from a template like this. The empty headings act as a checklist — the blank "Non-Goals" and "Alternatives Considered" sections nag you into filling them.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Write it before you build, not after.** A doc written after the code is a justification, not a design.
2. **Lead with Context and Goals/Non-Goals.** A reviewer must understand the problem and scope before the solution makes sense.
3. **Always fill Alternatives Considered.** At least one rejected option with a real reason. "I considered nothing else" is rarely true and never convincing.
4. **Write for a reader who isn't in your head.** Define terms, link prerequisites, include a diagram.
5. **Right-size it.** One page for one feature; a heavier RFC only for cross-team or irreversible work.
6. **Mark it as point-in-time.** Put a date and a status on it; don't pretend it stays accurate forever.
7. **Make the decision land in an ADR.** When the doc is resolved, record the decision durably (see [05](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/)).

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Skipping the doc and "just building."** The expensive way to discover the plan was wrong.
2. **Writing the doc *after* the code.** It stops being a thinking tool and becomes a rubber stamp.
3. **No Non-Goals.** Every reader then imagines a different, bigger project, and scope balloons.
4. **No Alternatives Considered.** Signals you grabbed the first idea; invites the team to re-litigate later.
5. **All "Design," no cross-cutting concerns.** The security/rollout/observability gaps are exactly what review is for.
6. **Treating the doc as a living reference.** It's a point-in-time artifact; once built, reality moves on and the doc rots (see [11](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/)).
7. **Over-processing a tiny change.** A 10-page RFC for a rename is theater.

---

## Tricky Points

- **The doc is more valuable as a *thinking/alignment tool* than as a lasting artifact.** Its biggest payoff happens *while you write it* and *during review* — not in being read months later.
- **A design doc is point-in-time, an ADR is durable.** Don't try to keep the design doc accurate forever; that's what reference docs and ADRs are for. The doc captured the *plan and the discussion*; the ADR captures the *decision*.
- **"RFC" the noun vs the process.** Sometimes "RFC" means the document; sometimes it means the whole comment-and-decide workflow. Both are common.
- **Non-Goals are not a list of everything you won't do.** They're the *tempting* things a reader might reasonably expect you to include but you're deliberately excluding.
- **Alternatives Considered must include a real rejection reason.** "Option B: also possible" is not an alternatives section. The *why-rejected* is the value.

## Test Yourself

1. In one sentence, why do you write a design doc *before* building?
2. What does "writing is thinking" mean in this context?
3. Name the two highest-value sections of a design doc and why.
4. What are Non-Goals, and what problem do they prevent?
5. What's the difference between a design doc, an RFC, and an ADR?
6. Why is a design doc a *point-in-time* artifact and not a living reference?

                less wasted code — while change is still CHEAP

WRITING IS THINKING   the act of writing exposes gaps; the doc is a
                      thinking tool first, an artifact second

DESIGN-DOC SECTIONS
  Context/Background → Goals & Non-Goals → Design (overview+detailed)
  → Alternatives Considered → Cross-cutting (sec/privacy/obs/test/rollout/cost)
  → Open Questions → Timeline

HIGHEST-VALUE   Goals/Non-Goals  +  Alternatives Considered (WHY rejected)

                plan              comment    choose      remember

RIGHT-SIZE      one feature → 1 page · cross-team/irreversible → full RFC
                config rename → no doc   (more = theater)

POINT-IN-TIME   the doc goes stale after build — that's fine.
                durable facts live in reference docs + ADRs
```

## Summary

- A **design doc / RFC** is written *before* building to **align people, surface risks, and get review while change is cheap.**
- **"Writing is thinking":** the act of writing forces clarity and exposes gaps — the doc is a thinking/alignment tool first, a lasting artifact second.
- The Google-style anatomy: **Context → Goals & Non-Goals → Design → Alternatives Considered → cross-cutting concerns → Open Questions → Timeline.**
- The two highest-value sections are **Goals/Non-Goals** and **Alternatives Considered (with why-rejected).**
- **Design doc → RFC → ADR is a pipeline:** plan → opened for comment & decision → durable record. Not competitors.
- **Right-size** the doc to the risk, and remember it's **point-in-time** — it rots after build, and that's expected.
