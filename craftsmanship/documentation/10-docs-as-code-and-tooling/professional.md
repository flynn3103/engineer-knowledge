## Introduction

> Focus: **production** — making Docs as Code work across many teams, for years.

Standing up MkDocs and a link checker is a day's work. Making Docs as Code the **default way an entire organization documents**, and keeping that true through reorgs, deadlines, and a hundred PRs a week, is the professional problem. It is mostly *not* a tooling problem — it's rollout, governance, incentives, and migration, with tooling in service of those.

The recurring failure: a team adopts Docs as Code, the docs are great for three months, then a deadline hits, "we'll document it next sprint" becomes permanent, the link checker goes red and gets disabled, and within a year the repo's docs are as stale as the wiki they replaced. Sustaining Docs as Code is a system: gates that make the right thing automatic, metrics that surface rot before users hit it, and a culture that treats a wrong doc as a bug.

## Rolling Out Docs as Code to an Org

A migration that lands has a shape. One that fails is usually a big-bang tool swap with no workflow change.

1. **Pilot on one motivated team.** Pick a team that already cares about docs and a repo with real docs pain. Prove the loop (edit → PR → CI → deploy) end to end. Produce a reference setup others copy.
2. **Standardize the toolchain, not just the tool.** Publish a template repo: `mkdocs.yml`, the CI workflow, the Vale config, `CODEOWNERS`, a starter IA. Teams should adopt by *copying a working setup*, not assembling one.
3. **Make the simple path the default.** A `cookiecutter`/template that scaffolds docs in every new repo means the docs structure exists before anyone has to think about it.
4. **Integrate into existing CI, don't add a parallel system.** Docs checks run in the same pipeline as code checks. A separate docs CI nobody watches is dead on arrival.
5. **Train on the *workflow*, not Markdown.** Engineers know Markdown; what trips them is "docs change goes in the same PR as the behavior change." That's the habit to instill.
6. **Address non-engineer contributors up front** (the [Senior](senior.md) problem): ship the "edit this page" pencil and/or a CMS-over-Git layer in the pilot, or those docs won't migrate.

> Rollout truth: **Docs as Code spreads by being the lower-friction option, not by mandate.** If the template makes documenting easier than not documenting, teams adopt it. If it's a compliance checkbox, they game it.

## Migrating off a Wiki

Moving years of Confluence/wiki content into the repo is the most common large migration. Done naively (export everything, dump it in), you import the wiki's rot into Git and gain nothing.

| Step | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Inventory & triage** | List every page; tag *current / stale / duplicate / dead* | Most wiki content is rotten; migrating it all imports the rot |
| **2. Delete aggressively** | Don't migrate stale/dead pages — archive them read-only | A smaller, true docs set beats a large, distrusted one |
| **3. Convert format** | Confluence/HTML → Markdown (`pandoc`, dedicated exporters) | Plain text is the substrate; clean up the machine conversion |
| **4. Re-architect, don't re-paste** | Reorganize into a real IA (Diátaxis), not the wiki's tree | The wiki's structure is usually accidental; fix it now |
| **5. Establish single source** | Redirect/lock the old wiki; one canonical home going forward | Two live sources = the "where's the truth?" problem returns |
| **6. Backfill ownership & gates** | `CODEOWNERS`, link-check, build in CI | Without gates, the new docs rot exactly like the wiki did |

```text
   OLD WIKI (mixed truth/rot)         NEW DOCS-AS-CODE
   ┌────────────────────┐            ┌────────────────────┐
   │ 1200 pages         │  triage    │ ~300 pages          │
   │  ~30% current      │ ─────────▶ │  curated, true      │
   │  ~70% stale/dupe   │  delete    │  IA-structured      │
   └────────────────────┘            │  gated in CI        │
        lock read-only ◀── redirect ─┘  (single source)    │
                                      └────────────────────┘
```

The non-obvious lesson from real migrations: **the value is in the deletion, not the import.** A migration that moves 1,200 pages is a failure; one that distills them to the 300 that are true and gives those a maintained home is a success.

## Governance: CODEOWNERS, Gates, and Policy

Governance encodes the senior reasoning so teams get it right by default and reviewers cite policy, not preference.

**Ownership** — every doc area has owners, enforced by the platform:

```text
# .github/CODEOWNERS  — doc changes auto-request the right reviewers
/docs/                 @docs-guild
/docs/auth/            @security-team
/docs/billing/         @payments-team
/docs/reference/       @api-platform   # generated; changes signal a generator issue
*.md                   @docs-guild
mkdocs.yml             @docs-guild     # site config is high-blast-radius
.vale/                 @docs-guild     # style rules are org-wide
```

**Branch protection** makes the gates non-optional:

```yaml
# required status checks on the docs path
required_status_checks:
  - markdownlint
  - vale
  - linkcheck-internal     # mkdocs --strict + internal lychee
  - build
# external link crawl is NOT required (scheduled) — keep the gate trustworthy
```

**Written policy** in the engineering handbook, so it's standard not personal:

- *Docs change ships in the same PR as the behavior change.* (Docs in Definition of Done.)
- *Reference is generated, never hand-maintained.*
- *Internal links hard-fail; external links are checked on a schedule.*
- *One-way-door decisions get an [ADR](../05-architecture-decision-records-adrs/professional.md).*

> Governance's job is to make "documented, reviewed, link-checked" the path of least resistance and "undocumented behavior change" the path that gets blocked at the gate.

## Enforcing Docs in Code Review

Docs rot enters one un-updated PR at a time, so review is where it's stopped. The reviewer's docs checklist:

1. **Behavior changed → docs changed?** A flag default, an endpoint, a config key, a setup step changed *and the PR touches no docs* is a red flag. Ask: "what doc describes this, and did it move?"
2. **Examples still correct?** If the change breaks a documented example, the example must update — ideally the executable-examples gate already caught it.
3. **Reference vs. hand-written.** A hand-written list of endpoints/flags is a smell — it should be generated. Push back on hand-maintained volatile facts.
4. **Single-sourcing.** Is this fact copy-pasted from somewhere it already lives? Prefer an include.
5. **Right IA mode.** Is this reference content leaking into a tutorial, or vice versa? (Diátaxis.)

### Review comment templates

> "This PR changes the default for `--timeout` from 30s to 60s but doesn't touch `docs/config/`. Same PR should update the documented default — otherwise the docs are wrong on merge."

> "This is a hand-maintained table of every endpoint. It'll drift the first time someone adds a route. Can we generate it from the OpenAPI spec instead?"

> "Great content, but it's pasted from the auth guide. Let's `--8<--` include the canonical block so they can't disagree later."

> "The external link to that blog 404s, but that's outside our control — the scheduled crawl will track it. Don't block this PR on it."

## Measuring Docs Health

You can't manage rot you can't see. Useful, non-vanity metrics:

| Metric | What it tells you | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Broken internal links** | Build integrity | `mkdocs --strict` / lychee — should be **zero** |
| **External link rot rate** | Decay of outbound references | scheduled lychee crawl |
| **Doc freshness / staleness** | Pages not touched since the code they describe changed | git timestamps vs. code change-coupling |
| **Build success rate** | Pipeline health | CI history |
| **Example test pass rate** | Whether shown code actually works | doctest/testable-examples CI |
| **Coverage of public surface** | % of endpoints/flags with docs | diff generated reference vs. hand-written |
| **Time-to-publish** | Friction of the docs loop | PR-open → deploy duration |
| **"Docs were wrong" incidents** | Ground-truth quality | support tickets / incident tags |

### The honest-measurement rules

- **Zero broken internal links is achievable and non-negotiable** — it's fully under your control. Track it; never let it drift above zero.
- **Don't confuse volume with health.** "5,000 pages" is not a quality metric; a smaller, *true* set is better. Page count is vanity.
- **Staleness via change-coupling is the rot detector:** if `auth/tokens.py` changes frequently but `docs/auth/tokens.md` hasn't been touched in a year, that doc is probably wrong. (This is the core technique of [Keeping Docs Alive](../11-keeping-docs-alive-and-doc-rot/professional.md).)
- **The ground-truth metric is "docs-were-wrong" incidents** — support tickets and outages caused by stale docs. If those are dropping, the system works regardless of what the page counts say.

> Never report "docs improved" with page count. Report broken-links (zero), staleness on hot files, example pass rate, and docs-were-wrong incidents.

---

## Operating the Pipeline

A docs pipeline is production infrastructure once teams depend on it:

- **Pin everything.** Pin SSG, plugin, and GitHub Action versions. An unpinned plugin minor bump that changes `--strict` behavior can red every docs PR org-wide overnight.
- **Keep the required path fast and deterministic.** Cache dependencies; run the full external-link crawl and exhaustive example tests on a schedule, not on every PR. A 12-minute required docs check trains people to bypass it.
- **Monitor the deploy, not just the build.** A green build that fails to publish (expired token, broken Pages config) means users see stale docs with no signal. Alert on deploy failure.
- **Own the aggregation's failure modes.** If you build one site from many repos, a single source repo being unavailable can break the whole docs deploy — degrade gracefully (skip+warn), don't hard-fail the world.
- **Have a rollback.** Docs deploys can ship a broken render; keep the ability to redeploy the last-good build fast.

## Real Incidents

### Incident 1: The wiki migration that imported the rot

A team exported 1,400 Confluence pages and bulk-converted them into the repo, declaring victory. Six months later engineers trusted the new docs no more than the old wiki — because ~70% of the imported pages were the same stale content, now just in Markdown. **Fix:** a triage pass deleted/archived ~1,000 pages, re-architected the survivors into a Diátaxis structure, and added a staleness metric. **Lesson:** migrating a wiki is mostly *deleting* it. Format conversion without curation imports the rot.

### Incident 2: The flaky external link gate everyone disabled

A team gated every PR on a full link crawl including external sites. A popular external blog had intermittent downtime, reddening unrelated docs PRs. Frustrated engineers added `# skip linkcheck` everywhere, then disabled the gate. Months later the docs were full of dead *internal* links too — the baby went out with the bathwater. **Fix:** split the gate — internal links hard-fail in PR CI, external links run on a weekly cron that files an issue. **Lesson:** gate what you control; a gate that fails for reasons outside the author's control gets routed around, taking the valuable checks with it.

### Incident 3: The doc that lied — and caused an outage

A runbook documented a database failover command. A release changed the command's flags but didn't update the runbook (no docs gate on that repo). At 3 a.m. an on-call engineer ran the documented command verbatim; it did the wrong thing and extended the outage. **Fix:** the failover steps became an *executable* check run in CI against a staging cluster, so a flag change that breaks the runbook reds the build. **Lesson:** for operational docs, "test the example" isn't a nicety — a wrong runbook is an availability risk. (See [Runbooks & Ops Docs](../07-runbooks-and-operational-docs/professional.md).)

### Incident 4: The unpinned plugin that broke every docs PR

A `mkdocs-material` minor release tightened a `--strict` warning. Because the CI installed it unpinned (`pip install mkdocs-material`), every docs PR across the org went red the next morning with a build no author had changed. **Fix:** pin versions in a lockfile; upgrade deliberately in a dedicated PR that fixes the new warnings. **Lesson:** the docs pipeline is production infrastructure — treat its dependencies with the same discipline as the app's.

## The Politics of Docs as Code

Sustaining it is partly a social problem:

- **Docs are the first thing cut under deadline.** "We'll document it next sprint" is where docs go to die. Counter: docs in Definition of Done, enforced at review — the behavior change *doesn't merge* without its docs.
- **Writing docs is undervalued vs. shipping features.** If documentation never appears in promotion criteria, rational engineers deprioritize it. Make doc quality visible and credited.
- **Deleting docs feels risky and goes unrewarded.** Yet deleting a stale, wrong page is often more valuable than adding one. Celebrate curation, as you celebrate code deletions.
- **The non-engineer exclusion is political too.** If support/product can't easily fix docs, they resent the system. Investing in the WYSIWYG-over-Git layer is partly buying their buy-in.
- **Leaders set the norm.** If senior engineers ship behavior changes without doc updates, everyone does. Model "the docs PR is part of the change."

## Review Checklist

```text
DOCS-AS-CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST
[ ] BEHAVIOR  did this PR change behavior (flag/endpoint/config/step)?
              if yes → does the SAME PR update the docs?
[ ] EXAMPLES  do documented examples still run? (executable-examples gate green)
[ ] GENERATED reference facts are generated, not hand-maintained
[ ] DRY       no copy-pasted fact that should be a single-sourced include
[ ] IA        content is in the right Diátaxis mode (no ref/tutorial mixing)
[ ] LINKS     internal links resolve (build --strict green); external = scheduled
[ ] OWNERS    CODEOWNERS routed the right reviewers
[ ] RENDER    preview deploy looks right (tables, diagrams, admonitions render)
[ ] GATES     red pipeline is the author's bug, not third-party flakiness
```

## Cheat Sheet

```text
ROLLOUT       pilot one team → template repo (mkdocs.yml + CI + Vale + CODEOWNERS)
              → integrate into existing CI → train the WORKFLOW, not Markdown

WIKI MIGRATE  inventory → DELETE aggressively → convert → re-architect (Diátaxis)
              → single source (lock old) → backfill gates. Value is in deletion.

GOVERNANCE    CODEOWNERS per area · branch protection (internal links REQUIRED,
              external NOT) · written policy: docs-PR-per-behavior-change

MEASURE       broken internal links = ZERO · staleness on hot files · example
              pass rate · "docs-were-wrong" incidents.  NOT page count.

OPERATE       PIN versions · keep required checks fast · run heavy checks on cron
              · monitor the DEPLOY · own aggregation failure · keep a rollback

POLITICS      docs in DoD · credit doc work · celebrate deletions · fund the
              non-engineer (WYSIWYG-over-Git) path · leaders model it
```
