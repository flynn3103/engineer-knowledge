# Per-Language Tools — Senior

> **Roadmap:** [Build Systems](../README.md) → Per-Language Tools
> *Put the five tools side by side and one axis dominates everything else: how deterministic is the build, by default, with no heroics? Go scores high. npm historically scored close to zero. That single number predicts your supply-chain risk, your CI flakiness, and the day you'll outgrow the tool entirely.*

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **Comparing the tools along the axes that actually decide architecture — determinism, hermeticity, supply-chain surface, and scaling ceiling.**

At the middle level you learned *how* each tool resolves versions. At the senior level you choose, defend, and operate these tools, which means scoring them on the axes that show up in postmortems: **Is the build deterministic by default?** **Is it hermetic — sealed from the host machine?** **How big is the attack surface when I add a dependency?** **At what scale does this tool fall over?**

These are not academic. "npm builds aren't reproducible" is the root cause of a class of production incidents and the reason `package-lock.json` exists at all. "Cargo isn't hermetic" is why a `build.rs` that reads `/usr/include` produces different binaries on two machines. "Go is deterministic by construction" is why Go shops rarely fight their build tool. And "a language tool can't model cross-language dependencies" is the precise moment teams adopt Bazel ([05 — Polyglot / Hermetic Builds](../05-polyglot-hermetic-builds/junior.md)).

This page is the comparison that lets you reason about all five at once and predict their failure modes before you hit them.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** [middle.md](middle.md) — MVS vs newest-compatible, lockfile semantics, build scripts.
- **Required:** [01 — Build Fundamentals · middle](../01-build-fundamentals/middle.md) — the ABI, link/load borders; reproducibility builds on these.
- **Helpful:** You've operated at least one of these tools in CI and seen a non-deterministic failure.
- **Helpful:** A working notion of "hash as cache key" from [07 — Build Caching](../07-build-caching/senior.md).

---

## The Comparison Matrix

The whole topic on one screen. Read it down the columns — each row is an axis you'll be asked to defend.

| Axis | Go | Cargo (Rust) | Gradle/Maven (JVM) | pip/poetry/uv (Python) | npm/pnpm (JS) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Manifest** | `go.mod` | `Cargo.toml` | `build.gradle` / `pom.xml` | `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` | `package.json` |
| **Lockfile** | `go.sum` (integrity only) | `Cargo.lock` | optional (Gradle), rare (Maven) | `poetry.lock` / `uv.lock` (none for raw pip) | `package-lock.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| **Resolution** | MVS (min) | newest-compatible, solver | nearest-wins (Maven) / newest (Gradle) | backtracking (newest) | newest-compatible |
| **One version per pkg?** | yes | yes | yes (conflicts → forced) | yes | **no** (nested tree) |
| **Deterministic by default?** | **yes** | yes *with* lock | only with lock + pinned | only with lock | only with lock + `ci` |
| **Hermetic by default?** | nearly (no host toolchain pull, but cgo escapes) | no (`build.rs` reads host) | no (host JDK, plugins) | **no** (native builds, host C libs) | no (`postinstall`, native modules) |
| **Install runs code?** | no | yes (`build.rs`) | yes (scripts/plugins) | yes (`setup.py`, build backends) | yes (lifecycle scripts) |
| **Build cache** | content-hash, global | fingerprint, per-project `target/` | task-output, local+remote | none (env install) | none (pnpm: CAS store) |
| **Scaling ceiling** | high (fast, simple) | medium (compile times) | medium (daemon, memory) | low (env + native pain) | medium (monorepo tooling) |

Two cells deserve emphasis before we unpack them. **Go is the only "deterministic by default" cell with no qualifier** — every other tool needs a lockfile (and often a clean-install flag) to get there. And **npm is the only "one version per package = no" cell** — that nested tree is both why npm rarely fails resolution and why "duplicate React" bugs and bloated bundles are npm-specific pathologies.

---

## Reproducibility and Hermeticity, Per Tool

These two words get conflated; they are distinct guarantees and a senior must keep them apart.

- **Reproducible** = same inputs → same output bytes, across time and machines. Concerns *version selection and ordering*.
- **Hermetic** = the build depends *only* on declared inputs, sealed from the host (no reading `/usr/lib`, no ambient `$PATH`, no network mid-build). Concerns *what the build is allowed to touch*.

A build can be reproducible-on-my-machine without being hermetic — it'll reproduce here but break elsewhere because it secretly depended on a host library. Full reproducibility *requires* hermeticity. ([09 — Reproducible Builds](../09-reproducible-builds/senior.md) is the deep treatment.)

| Tool | Reproducible? | Hermetic? | The leak |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Go** | Strong — MVS + `go.sum` + embedded build metadata | Mostly — pure-Go is sealed; **cgo** escapes to host C toolchain/headers | cgo, `-ldflags` injecting timestamps/paths |
| **Cargo** | Good — `Cargo.lock` pins the graph | Weak — `build.rs` may read host env, files, run arbitrary tools | `build.rs` probing the system; host C deps |
| **Gradle/Maven** | Medium — pin plugins + deps + JDK | Weak — host JDK version, plugin behavior, system props | unpinned JDK, dynamic versions (`1.+`), plugin nondeterminism |
| **Python** | Weak→Medium — needs lockfile + hashes; wheels help, sdists hurt | **Weakest** — native builds link host C libraries at install | building from sdist against host `libffi`/`openssl` |
| **npm/pnpm** | Medium — lockfile + `ci`; historically poor | Weak — `postinstall`, native addon compilation | lifecycle scripts, `node-gyp` against host toolchain |

> **Key insight:** the determinism gradient runs Go → cargo → JVM/npm → Python, and it tracks one thing: **how much the build is allowed to depend on the host.** Go ships its own everything and selects versions algorithmically. Python builds native extensions against whatever C libraries the host happens to have. That is why "it built fine in CI but the wheel is broken on the prod base image" is a Python sentence, almost never a Go sentence.

---

## Why Go Is Reproducible and npm Historically Wasn't

This contrast is the cleanest case study in the roadmap, and a favorite interview question.

**Go's reproducibility is structural, not bolted on:**

1. **MVS is deterministic** — given the same `go.mod` files, version selection is a pure function. No "what's the latest published right now" input. (See [middle.md](middle.md).)
2. **`go.sum` enforces integrity** — every module's content hash is verified; the module proxy and checksum database (`sum.golang.org`) make tampering detectable.
3. **The build cache key is a content hash** of source + compiler version + flags + dependency hashes — same inputs, same `.a`, byte for byte.
4. **`-trimpath` and reproducible metadata** remove absolute paths and let you strip timestamps, so the *binary* itself can be bit-identical.

```bash
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-buildid=" -o app    # strip path + buildid → reproducible binary
GOFLAGS="-mod=readonly" go build                   # refuse to mutate go.mod/go.sum silently
```

**npm's historical non-determinism had several causes, now mostly fixed:**

1. **No lockfile before npm v5 (2017).** `npm install` resolved fresh every time; two installs days apart differed. This *was* the default for years.
2. **Floating ranges + newest-compatible** mean the manifest alone is a moving target (middle level).
3. **Install order affected the `node_modules` tree shape**, so even "the same versions" could lay out differently and behave differently.
4. **Lifecycle scripts** run host-dependent code, so even a pinned graph could produce host-specific results.

The fixes — `package-lock.json`, `npm ci`, integrity hashes (`sha512` SRI in the lock), and pnpm's content-addressed store — closed most of the gap. But the *defaults* still differ: a fresh Go checkout reproduces with `go build`; a fresh npm checkout reproduces only if you committed the lock *and* used `npm ci`. Defaults are what teams actually get.

> **Key insight:** reproducibility is a property of *defaults*, not of *what's achievable*. Both ecosystems can be made reproducible. Only one is reproducible when a junior runs the obvious command. When you evaluate a tool, ask "what happens when someone does the naive thing?" — that's the behavior you'll get at scale.

---

## The Supply-Chain Surface of Each Tool

Every dependency you add is code that runs in your CI and on your laptop. The *surface* is how much can run and how easily it's subverted.

| Vector | Go | Cargo | JVM | Python | npm |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Arbitrary code at install/build** | no (build is pure) | `build.rs` | scripts/plugins | `setup.py` / build backend | lifecycle scripts |
| **Typosquatting risk** | low (import paths are URLs) | medium | medium | **high** (flat PyPI namespace) | **high** (flat npm namespace) |
| **Dependency-confusion risk** | low (module path = domain) | low-medium | medium (group:artifact) | high | **high** |
| **Transitive blast radius** | small (lean graphs) | medium | medium | medium | **huge** (thousands of transitives) |
| **Integrity verification** | `go.sum` + checksum DB | crate checksums | (opt-in) | hashes in lock (poetry/uv) | SRI in lock |

The structural differences that matter:

- **Go's import paths are URLs** (`github.com/org/repo`). You can't typosquat `github.com/lodash` the way you can publish `lodahs` to npm's flat namespace. The namespace *is* the provenance.
- **npm's blast radius is categorically larger.** A flat global namespace + thousands of transitives + auto-run lifecycle scripts is why the famous incidents (`event-stream`, `colors`/`faker` sabotage, the left-pad unpublish) are *npm* incidents. The surface is just bigger.
- **Dependency-confusion** (publishing a public package with the same name as a company's *private* one, so the resolver fetches the attacker's) hits flat-namespace ecosystems (npm, PyPI) hardest — and is why private-registry scoping and `--registry` pinning are non-optional at org scale (professional level).
- **`build.rs` and `postinstall` are pre-auth RCE on every developer machine.** A compromised transitive dependency executes the instant someone runs `cargo build` or `npm install`. pnpm's deny-dependency-scripts-by-default and `npm ci --ignore-scripts` exist precisely to shrink this.

> **Key insight:** supply-chain risk is not evenly distributed across ecosystems — it's a function of (namespace structure) × (transitive count) × (does install run code). Go scores low on all three by design; npm scores high on all three by history. When a security team says "we're standardizing on Go for the edge service," this matrix is the unstated argument.

## Caching Internals — What the Cache Key Actually Hashes

The cache is only as good as its *key*. A correct cache key includes **every input that can change the output**; miss one and you get stale-result bugs (false hit) — the worst kind, because the build "succeeds" with wrong output. ([07 — Build Caching · senior](../07-build-caching/senior.md) is the dedicated page; here's the per-tool reality.)

- **Go** — the cache key is a hash of: source file contents + the compiler/toolchain version + build flags (`GOFLAGS`, tags, `-trimpath`) + the hashes of all dependency packages. This is why Go's cache is safe to share and why a toolchain upgrade correctly invalidates everything. `go build` writes keyed entries under `$GOCACHE`.
- **Cargo** — uses a "fingerprint" per build unit: a hash combining the crate's source, the resolved dependency versions, the profile (debug/release), features, `RUSTFLAGS`, and the rustc version. The fingerprint files live in `target/.../.fingerprint`. `sccache` adds a *compiler-level* cache (hashing the preprocessed input + compiler + flags) that can be shared remotely.
- **Gradle** — task-level: each task declares inputs (files, properties) and outputs; the key is a hash of declared inputs. **Incorrectly declared inputs are the #1 cause of Gradle cache bugs** — a task that reads a file it didn't declare gets a false hit. The remote build cache shares these across the team.
- **Maven** — historically *no* build cache (it rebuilds modules each `mvn install`); the Maven build-cache extension is a recent bolt-on.
- **npm/pip** — these cache *downloads*, not compilation (interpreted). pnpm's content-addressed store keys on the *tarball content hash*, so identical package versions are stored once globally and linked in.

```bash
go env GOCACHE                       # where Go's keyed compile cache lives
cargo build -v 2>&1 | grep Fresh     # "Fresh" = fingerprint hit; "Compiling" = miss
gradle build --build-cache --info | grep -i cache   # see hits/misses + why
RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache cargo build && sccache --show-stats   # compiler-level shared cache
```

> **Key insight:** the difference between a fast build farm and a flaky one is whether the cache key captures *all* inputs. Go and cargo compute the key from content automatically and are hard to fool. Gradle makes you *declare* inputs, so the key is only as correct as your task definitions — which is why "clean build fixes it" is a Gradle catchphrase: a clean build sidesteps a wrong key.

## When a Language Tool Stops Scaling

Every language tool has a ceiling. Knowing the symptoms is what separates "we need a bigger CI runner" from "we need a different build system."

**Symptoms you're hitting the ceiling:**

1. **Cross-language dependencies the tool can't model.** Your Go service generates code from a Protobuf shared with a TypeScript frontend and a Python ML service. No single language tool understands "rebuild the TS client when the `.proto` changes." Each tool sees only its own language.
2. **No correct incremental builds across the whole repo.** Cargo caches *its* crates; Gradle caches *its* tasks; they don't share a graph. A change to a shared schema can't trigger precise rebuilds across languages.
3. **No hermeticity, so caching is unsafe to share.** Because `build.rs`/`postinstall`/host-JDK leak the host in, a cache entry built on machine A may be subtly wrong on machine B. You can't trust a shared remote cache without hermeticity.
4. **CI time dominated by redundant rebuilds.** Without a unified content-addressed graph, CI rebuilds things that didn't change because no tool can prove they didn't.

**What teams reach for:** a **polyglot, hermetic build system** — Bazel (Google), Buck2 (Meta), Pants (Twitter/Toolchain), or Nix. These impose:

- **One dependency graph across all languages** — the `.proto` change correctly invalidates the Go, TS, and Python consumers.
- **Hermetic execution** — sandboxed actions with *declared* inputs only, so cache entries are safe to share across the whole org (remote caching + remote execution).
- **Content-addressed, fine-grained caching** that actually works at monorepo scale.

The cost is real: Bazel makes you re-describe your build in `BUILD` files, wrap each language's toolchain, and abandon the ergonomic `cargo build` for `bazel build //...`. You adopt it when the *correctness and scale* of the unified graph outweighs the *ergonomics* of the native tool — typically a large polyglot monorepo with a build-platform team. The full treatment is [05 — Polyglot / Hermetic Builds](../05-polyglot-hermetic-builds/junior.md).

> **Key insight:** language tools optimize for *one language, great ergonomics*. They have no concept of "the language next door." The day your build graph crosses languages and your cache must be shared org-wide *safely*, the language tool's lack of hermeticity and cross-language modeling becomes the bottleneck — and that, not raw speed, is the real reason teams migrate to Bazel.

---

## Mental Models

- **Determinism is a property of defaults, not of ceilings.** Anything can be made reproducible. The question is what the *naive command* produces. Go's naive command is reproducible; npm's isn't without `ci` + committed lock. You operate the defaults.

- **Reproducible ⊂ requires hermetic.** You can be reproducible-here-by-luck without being hermetic. You cannot be reproducible-everywhere without being hermetic. Hermeticity is the prerequisite; reproducibility is the result.

- **The cache key is the whole game.** A cache that hashes too little gives false hits (stale wrong output) — catastrophic. Go/cargo hash content automatically; Gradle makes you declare inputs (and you'll get it wrong). "Clean build fixed it" almost always means "the key was incomplete."

- **Supply-chain risk = namespace × transitives × install-executes-code.** Multiply the three. Go is low·low·no; npm is high·huge·yes. The product predicts your incident rate.

- **The language tool ends at the language border.** Its entire worldview is one language. Cross that border and no amount of `cargo`/`npm` tuning helps — you've left the tool's problem domain and entered Bazel's.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Claiming a build is reproducible because *you* can reproduce it.** Reproducible-on-one-machine is the easy 80%. Without hermeticity it breaks on a different host. Test reproduction on a *clean, different* machine before claiming it.

2. **Trusting a shared/remote cache from a non-hermetic build.** If `build.rs` or `postinstall` reads the host, a cache entry from machine A can be wrong on machine B. Only hermetic builds make remote caching *safe*, not just fast.

3. **Under-declaring inputs to a Gradle task.** A task that reads an undeclared file gets a false cache hit and produces stale output. The fix is correct `@Input`/`@InputFiles` declarations, not `--no-build-cache`.

4. **Treating npm's supply-chain surface as equal to Go's.** It isn't — flat namespace, huge transitive graphs, and auto-run lifecycle scripts make npm categorically higher-risk. Apply heavier controls (lockfile + `ci` + `--ignore-scripts` + audit + private scoping) accordingly.

5. **Adopting Bazel to "make builds faster" in a single-language repo.** Bazel's payoff is *cross-language correctness + safe org-wide caching at scale*. In a single-language repo with a good native tool, you pay all the ergonomic cost for little benefit. Migrate for the right reason.

6. **Ignoring cgo when reasoning about Go's hermeticity.** Pure-Go is nearly hermetic; the moment you enable cgo, you depend on the host C toolchain and headers, and the "Go is reproducible" guarantee weakens. Know which side of cgo you're on.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Define *reproducible* and *hermetic* and explain why reproducibility (everywhere) requires hermeticity.
2. Give three structural reasons Go builds are reproducible by default that npm builds historically were not.
3. Why is "reproducibility is a property of defaults" the right framing, given that npm *can* be made reproducible?
4. Express supply-chain risk as a product of three factors and use it to compare Go and npm.
5. What does Go's build cache key hash, and why does that make a shared cache safe — whereas a Gradle shared cache can produce stale output?
6. Name two symptoms that a language tool has hit its scaling ceiling, and what teams adopt in response.

## Cheat Sheet

```
DETERMINISM GRADIENT (by default, naive command)
  Go  >  cargo  >  JVM ≈ npm  >  Python
  tracks: how much the build depends on the HOST

TWO DISTINCT GUARANTEES
  reproducible = same inputs → same bytes        (version selection + ordering)
  hermetic     = depends ONLY on declared inputs (sealed from host)
  reproducible-everywhere  REQUIRES  hermetic

GO REPRODUCIBILITY (structural)
  MVS (deterministic) + go.sum (integrity) + content-hash cache + -trimpath
  go build -trimpath -ldflags="-buildid="    # bit-identical binary
  caveat: cgo escapes to host C toolchain

NPM HISTORY (why it wasn't reproducible)
  no lockfile pre-v5 ; floating ranges ; install-order tree shape ; lifecycle scripts
  fixed by: package-lock.json + npm ci + SRI hashes + pnpm CAS store

SUPPLY-CHAIN RISK = namespace × transitives × install-runs-code
  Go   : URL paths   · lean   · no     → LOW
  npm  : flat        · huge   · yes    → HIGH
  defenses: lockfile + ci + --ignore-scripts + audit + private-registry scoping

CACHE KEY = every input that affects output
  Go/cargo: hash content automatically (hard to fool)
  Gradle  : you DECLARE inputs (false hit if under-declared → "clean build fixes it")

WHEN TO LEAVE THE LANGUAGE TOOL → Bazel/Buck2/Pants/Nix
  cross-language deps it can't model · no safe org-wide cache · non-hermetic
  cost: re-describe build, wrap toolchains; payoff: unified graph + safe remote cache
```

## Summary

- The **comparison matrix** scores the five tools on manifest, lockfile, resolution, determinism, hermeticity, install-runs-code, caching, and scaling ceiling. Two cells dominate: **Go is the only "deterministic by default" with no qualifier**, and **npm is the only "multiple versions coexist."**
- **Reproducible** (same inputs → same bytes) and **hermetic** (sealed from host) are distinct; reproducing *everywhere* requires hermeticity. The determinism gradient Go → cargo → JVM/npm → Python tracks how much each build depends on the host.
- **Go's reproducibility is structural** — MVS + `go.sum` + content-hash cache + `-trimpath`. **npm's historical non-determinism** came from no early lockfile, floating ranges, install-order tree shape, and lifecycle scripts; fixes closed the gap but the *defaults* still differ.
- **Supply-chain surface = namespace structure × transitive count × install-runs-code.** Go scores low on all three by design; npm scores high by history — which is why the famous incidents are npm incidents.
- **The cache key is the whole game.** Go/cargo hash content automatically (safe to share); Gradle makes you declare inputs (under-declaration → false hits → "clean build fixes it"). Hermeticity is what makes a *shared* cache safe, not just fast.
- A language tool's ceiling is the **language border**: cross-language dependencies, unified incremental builds, and safe org-wide caching are where teams leave `cargo`/`npm` for **Bazel/Buck2/Pants/Nix** — adopted for cross-language correctness and safe caching, not raw speed.

The professional page takes this from "what's true about the tools" to "how do I run them across an org" — CI caching strategy per tool, lockfile hygiene and provenance, private registries, polyglot repos, and the war stories (npm lockfile churn, the Gradle daemon OOM, dependency-confusion attacks).
