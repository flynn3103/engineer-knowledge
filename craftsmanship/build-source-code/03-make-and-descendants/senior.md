## Introduction

> Focus: **What are the real correctness and design trade-offs across the Make family, and how do you choose?**

A senior engineer's relationship with build tools is not "I can write a Makefile." It's "I know exactly how this tool's correctness model can lie to me, I know why each descendant exists, and I can pick the right one for a given project and defend the choice in a design review."

This page covers the three things that distinguish that level. First, **Make's correctness failure modes** — the ways an incremental build can be *wrong* while reporting success, which is far more dangerous than a build that visibly fails. Second, the **design philosophies** of the descendants — not just "Ninja is fast" but *why* its minimalism is the source of that speed and correctness. Third, **selection judgment** — the actual decision matrix among Make, Ninja-via-generator, CMake, and Meson, with the trade-offs that matter in practice.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** [middle.md](middle.md) — pattern rules, generated header deps, the recursive-make problem, reading `build.ninja`, CMake as a generator.
- **Required:** Comfort with the dependency-graph model and incrementality from [02 — Dependency Graphs](../02-dependency-graphs/middle.md).
- **Helpful:** You've maintained a multi-thousand-line build configuration and felt where it hurt.
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with where Bazel/Buck go beyond this family ([05 — Polyglot & Hermetic Builds](../05-polyglot-hermetic-builds/junior.md)).

---

## Make's Correctness Failure Modes

Make's incrementality rests on two assumptions, and *every* correctness bug is one of them being violated:

1. The declared dependency graph is **complete** (every real input is a declared prerequisite).
2. File **mtimes** faithfully reflect "did the content change."

Both are routinely false. The failures, ranked by how much time they cost:

**Incomplete dependencies (the silent killer).** If an input isn't declared, Make won't rebuild on its change — and reports success. The header case is the famous one (fixed by `-MMD`, see [middle.md](middle.md)), but it generalizes: a generated source not declared as a prerequisite, a `CFLAGS` change that Make can't see (changing a flag doesn't change any file's mtime, so nothing rebuilds), a tool-version bump. **A build that is stale-but-green is worse than one that's red**, because it ships. Detection: periodically diff an incremental build against a clean (`make clean && make`) build; any difference is an undeclared dependency.

**`.PHONY` misuse.** Two opposite errors. (a) Forgetting `.PHONY` on an action target — a same-named file disables it ([junior.md](junior.md)). (b) Over-using phony: making real artifacts depend on phony targets forces perpetual rebuilds, destroying incrementality. A phony target is "always newer," so its dependents are always stale.

**Clock skew and mtime fragility.** Make trusts mtimes absolutely. This breaks when:
- Files are checked out from version control (Git sets mtime to *checkout time*, not commit time) — a fresh clone can have a `.o` "newer" than its `.c` purely by checkout order, masking a needed rebuild, or the reverse.
- Builds run across NFS or in containers where the build host and file host clocks differ — a file can appear to be from the *future*, and Make will rebuild it forever (or never).
- `touch` / `cp -p` / restored backups reset mtimes in ways that don't reflect content.
- A build completes in under one second on a filesystem with 1-second mtime granularity — input and output get the *same* timestamp, and Make can't tell stale from fresh.

> **Key insight:** Make's model is "mtime is a proxy for content change." Every descendant that improved on Make attacked this proxy. Ninja additionally records the *command line* used (so a flag change forces a rebuild — Make can't do this without manual `.FORCE` tricks). Bazel ([05](../05-polyglot-hermetic-builds/junior.md)) abandons mtime entirely for **content hashing** plus a *hermetic, fully-declared* input set, eliminating both failure classes by construction. When you understand Make's two assumptions, you understand precisely what each successor was buying you.

---

## Non-Recursive Make at Scale

The middle page named the recursive-make problem; here's how the *correct* pattern is actually built. The goal: one Make process, one complete graph, with per-directory modularity preserved through `include` rather than `$(MAKE) -C`.

The technique uses a per-directory fragment plus a small stack to track "which directory am I in":

```makefile
# top-level Makefile
all:                       # default target declared early, before fragments add prereqs

include libfoo/module.mk
include libbar/module.mk
include app/module.mk

# libfoo/module.mk — note paths are relative to the TOP, not the subdir
LIBFOO_SRCS := $(wildcard libfoo/*.c)
LIBFOO_OBJS := $(LIBFOO_SRCS:.c=.o)
libfoo/libfoo.a: $(LIBFOO_OBJS)
	$(AR) rcs $@ $^
all: libfoo/libfoo.a       # fragment APPENDS to the shared `all` target

# app/module.mk
app/app: $(wildcard app/*.o) libfoo/libfoo.a
	$(CC) $^ -o $@
all: app/app
```

Key properties this buys you: one process sees `app` depends on `libfoo/libfoo.a`, so the order is *derived*, not hand-sequenced; `make -j` parallelizes across the whole tree; no redundant re-parsing. The cost is discipline — every path is relative to the top-level directory, and large non-recursive Makefiles develop their own conventions (variable namespacing per module, `$(d)` directory-stack macros) that are real engineering. This is why, past a certain size, teams stop hand-rolling non-recursive Make and adopt a generator (CMake/Meson) that produces a correct single graph automatically.

> **Practical reality:** non-recursive Make is *correct* but *expensive to maintain by hand*. The honest senior position is: know how and why it works, but reach for a generator before you reinvent half of CMake in `.mk` fragments. The exception is a small-to-medium project where the team's Make fluency exceeds its CMake fluency.

## Ninja's Design Philosophy: Execute a Precomputed Graph, Fast

Ninja is the purest expression of a single principle: **separate description from execution, then optimize execution to the metal.** Understanding *why* its restrictions exist is the senior-level point.

What Ninja deliberately lacks, and what each omission buys:

- **No globbing/wildcards.** The generator must list every input explicitly. This means the graph is *fully known before any work starts* — Ninja never has to touch the filesystem to *discover* the graph, only to check mtimes of known files. A no-op build is then nearly instant: read the graph, stat the known files, compare against the build log.
- **No general string functions or conditionals.** Nothing to *evaluate* at build time, so parsing is trivial and fast.
- **Per-output explicit `build` statements.** No rule has to be matched/instantiated at build time; the generator already did that. Ninja just walks edges.
- **A build log + command hashing.** Ninja stores the exact command used to produce each output. If the *command* changes (a flag flip from the generator) — even with identical mtimes — Ninja rebuilds. This closes Make's "flag change → no rebuild" hole.
- **`depfile` / `deps` support.** Ninja consumes the compiler's generated header deps and can store them in its own fast database (`deps = gcc`), avoiding re-parsing `.d` files.

The result is the property Chromium needed: a multi-hundred-thousand-file project where `ninja` with nothing to do returns in well under a second. That speed is not a clever optimization bolted on — it is the *consequence* of refusing to do anything but execute a complete, precomputed graph.

> **Key insight:** Ninja's minimalism is a *correctness and speed strategy*, not asceticism. By forbidding build-time computation, it guarantees the graph is complete and known up front, which is exactly what makes both fast no-op builds and full-core parallelism possible. "Ninja is fast" and "Ninja is dumb" are the same sentence — and that's the design.

## CMake Internals: Configure vs Generate vs Build

Most CMake confusion comes from not distinguishing its three phases. They run at different times, fail for different reasons, and produce different things:

| Phase | Trigger | What it does | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Configure** | `cmake -S . -B build` | Runs `CMakeLists.txt` as a *script*: detects compiler, probes the system (`check_symbol_exists`, `find_package`), builds the in-memory target graph. Results cached in `CMakeCache.txt`. | `CMakeCache.txt`, configured headers |
| **Generate** | (end of the same command) | Translates the in-memory target graph into the chosen generator's files. | `build.ninja` / `Makefile` / `.sln` |
| **Build** | `cmake --build build` / `ninja -C build` | Runs the generated low-level build. CMake/CMake-language no longer involved. | Artifacts |

Critical consequences a senior must internalize:

- **`CMakeCache.txt` persists configure-time decisions.** Found-library paths, compiler identity, cached options — all frozen at first configure. This is the source of the infamous **cache corruption**: you switch compilers or move the source tree, but the cache still points at the old compiler/paths, and you get bizarre failures. The fix is brutal and correct: `rm -rf build/` and re-configure. Never debug a corrupted cache; delete it.
- **Out-of-source builds are mandatory practice.** Always `-B build` (a separate directory). In-source builds litter your tree with generated files and make "delete and re-configure" mean "delete everything."
- **Configure runs your `CMakeLists.txt` as code.** It is a full imperative language with variables, control flow, and side effects. This is why CMake is powerful *and* why old CMake is a swamp — people wrote elaborate configure-time logic that modern target-based CMake makes unnecessary.

> **Key insight:** "CMake is slow / weird / corrupts" almost always means someone is conflating the phases — editing source and only re-running build, or fighting a stale cache. The three-phase model is the diagnostic: *which phase failed?* tells you where to look. (Meson splits the same way: `meson setup` = configure+generate, `ninja`/`meson compile` = build.)

---

## Modern Target-Based CMake and Usage Requirements

CMake before ~3.0 was *directory-and-variable* oriented: global `include_directories()`, global `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`, manual propagation of flags to every consumer. It did not scale — flags leaked, dependencies were implicit, and large projects became unmaintainable.

Modern ("target-based") CMake treats each target as an object carrying its own **usage requirements** that propagate automatically along the dependency edges:

```cmake
add_library(json src/json.c)

# Usage requirements, scoped:
target_include_directories(json
  PUBLIC  include            # consumers of json AND json itself see this
  PRIVATE src)               # only json's own build sees this

target_compile_features(json PUBLIC c_std_11)
target_link_libraries(json PUBLIC m)     # consumers also link libm

add_executable(app main.c)
target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE json)  # app inherits json's PUBLIC requirements
                                          # → app automatically gets include/ and links m
```

The scoping keywords are the whole idea:

- **`PRIVATE`** — needed to build *this* target, not propagated to consumers.
- **`INTERFACE`** — *not* needed to build this target, but propagated to consumers (header-only libraries use this).
- **`PUBLIC`** — both (`PRIVATE` + `INTERFACE`).

`app` links `json` and *automatically* inherits `json`'s include directory, C standard, and transitive `libm` link — because they were declared `PUBLIC` on `json`. No global state, no manual propagation. This is the difference between CMake that scales to a large org ([professional.md](professional.md)) and CMake that becomes a tarball of global-variable spaghetti.

> **Key insight:** modern CMake is "describe each target's interface; let propagation handle the rest" — the same encapsulation principle as good software design, applied to the build graph. If a CMake codebase uses global `include_directories()` and `CMAKE_*_FLAGS` instead of `target_*`, it predates this model and is a migration candidate.

---

## Toolchain Files and Cross-Compilation

Cross-compilation ([08 — Cross-Compilation](../08-cross-compilation/junior.md) goes deep) is where CMake's configure phase earns its keep. A **toolchain file** is a small CMake script, passed at configure time, that tells CMake "you are not building for this machine":

```cmake
# arm64-linux.toolchain.cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR aarch64)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER   aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH /opt/sysroots/arm64)
# only find target libraries in the sysroot, never the host's:
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
```

```bash
cmake -S . -B build-arm64 --toolchain arm64-linux.toolchain.cmake -G Ninja
cmake --build build-arm64
```

The toolchain file is consumed at *configure* time, which is exactly right: cross-compilation decisions (which compiler, which sysroot, which libraries are "the target's") must be fixed before any probing happens. The `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*` settings prevent the classic cross-compile bug — `find_package` silently picking up the *host's* libraries instead of the target's. Meson uses an analogous "cross file" (`--cross-file`) for the same purpose. Hand-written Make has no built-in concept here; you wire it all through variables manually, which is why cross-compiling raw Makefiles is notoriously fragile.

---

## Meson's Design Choices

Meson is the "what would we build if we started over in 2012" answer. It generates Ninja (and only Ninja, plus VS/Xcode), so it inherits Ninja's speed and never tries to be an execution engine. Its deliberate choices, contrasted with CMake:

- **A real, restricted DSL — not Turing-complete.** Meson's language has no user-defined functions and no arbitrary loops over mutable state by design. The point: build descriptions should be *declarative and analyzable*, not programs. This trades flexibility for readability and predictability — the opposite of CMake's "configure is a full language" stance.
- **Sane defaults and conventions.** Out-of-source builds enforced, sensible warning levels, built-in unit-test and install support. Less ceremony to do the common thing right.
- **First-class subprojects and wraps.** Dependency fetching (`subprojects/*.wrap`) is built in, addressing the C/C++ "there is no package manager" gap more cleanly than CMake's `FetchContent`.
- **Speed and readability as explicit goals**, learned directly from watching CMake's pain points.

```meson
project('myapp', 'c', default_options : ['c_std=c11', 'warning_level=3'])

json = static_library('json', 'src/json.c', include_directories : 'include')
executable('app', 'main.c',
  link_with : json,
  include_directories : 'include',
  install : true)
```

The trade-off is ecosystem gravity: CMake is the de facto standard with vastly more `find_package` modules, IDE support, and existing projects. Meson is technically cleaner but adopting it means swimming against the current of "every C++ dependency assumes CMake." A senior weighs *language quality* against *ecosystem inertia* — and inertia usually wins for libraries meant to be consumed by others.

---

## Choosing Among Them

The decision is not aesthetic. The factors that actually drive it:

| If you... | Choose | Because |
|---|---|---|
| Have a small/medium project, Make-fluent team, Unix-only | **Make** (non-recursive) | Lowest barrier; ubiquitous; fine at this scale |
| Build C/C++ that others must *consume* and `find_package` | **CMake** | Ecosystem standard; export targets/package config others expect |
| Want a clean greenfield C/C++ build, value readability | **Meson** | Better language, faster, sane defaults — if you can accept smaller ecosystem |
| Need a fast executor under a generator | **Ninja** (never alone) | The default backend for both CMake and Meson |
| Have a large polyglot monorepo needing hermeticity & remote cache | **Bazel/Buck** ([05](../05-polyglot-hermetic-builds/junior.md)) | Make-family's mtime/non-hermetic model breaks at this scale |

Two principles cut through it:

1. **Always generate Ninja, never hand-write the low-level layer.** Whether CMake or Meson, target Ninja as the backend (`-G Ninja`). It's faster than Make backends and the standard.
2. **Library-for-others vs application-for-us is the pivotal axis.** A library that others embed almost *has* to ship CMake (and good `find_package` support) because that's what consumers expect — ecosystem compatibility outweighs language quality. An internal application has more freedom to pick Meson or even raw Make.

> **Key insight:** the senior question is never "which tool is best" in the abstract — it's "given this project's *consumers*, *team*, *platforms*, and *scale*, which trade-off is correct, and what's the migration cost if I'm wrong?" Generated vs authored, ecosystem vs ergonomics, mtime-incrementality vs hermeticity: name the axis the decision turns on, and the answer follows.

---

## Mental Models

- **Make's mtime model is a *proxy*, and every descendant attacks the proxy.** Make: mtime ≈ content change. Ninja: mtime + recorded command line. Bazel: content hash + hermetic declared inputs. Each step buys correctness by relying less on the proxy.

- **A stale-but-green build is the worst outcome in the whole field.** A red build stops you. A green-but-wrong build ships. The entire discipline of build correctness exists to eliminate the second case — which is why "diff incremental vs clean build" is a senior reflex.

- **CMake is a compiler; its bugs are compiler-phase bugs.** Configure = front end (parse + analyze the system). Generate = code generation (emit Ninja). Build = running the output. Diagnose by asking *which phase* — same as you would for a misbehaving compiler.

- **Usage requirements are encapsulation for the build graph.** A `target_*(... PUBLIC ...)` declaration is an *interface*; `PRIVATE` is an *implementation detail*. Good build design, like good code design, is about controlling what propagates across boundaries.

- **Ninja's stupidity is its correctness.** It can't compute anything at build time, so it can't be *wrong* about a graph it didn't compute — it only executes one handed to it complete. Restriction as a guarantee.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Trusting an incremental build's green status.** Undeclared dependencies (headers, flags, generated files, tool versions) make Make report success on a stale result. Periodically validate against a clean build.

2. **Debugging a corrupt `CMakeCache.txt` instead of deleting it.** Switched compilers, moved the tree, or got mysterious configure errors? `rm -rf build/` and re-configure. The cache freezes first-configure decisions; don't fight it.

3. **In-source CMake/Meson builds.** Generated files pollute the source tree; "clean" becomes dangerous. Always build in a separate directory (`-B build`).

4. **Writing old-style global CMake** (`include_directories()`, `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`) in new code. Flags leak, dependencies go implicit, it doesn't scale. Use `target_*` with `PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE`/`INTERFACE`.

5. **Letting a flag change not trigger a rebuild in Make.** Changing `CFLAGS` changes no file's mtime, so Make won't rebuild. Either force a clean, or encode flags into a tracked file the targets depend on. (Ninja handles this natively via command hashing.)

6. **Cross-compiling without root-path scoping.** Omitting `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*` lets `find_package` grab host libraries into a target build — links fine, fails on the device.

7. **Picking Meson for a public library and surprising consumers.** Technically nicer, but consumers expect CMake's `find_package`. For libraries-for-others, ecosystem compatibility usually outranks language quality.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Give two distinct ways a Make incremental build can report success while producing a *wrong* artifact, and how each is prevented.
2. Why does changing a compiler flag fail to trigger a rebuild in plain Make but not in Ninja?
3. Explain the three CMake phases. Which one does `CMakeCache.txt` belong to, and what's the standard fix for cache corruption?
4. What do `PUBLIC`, `PRIVATE`, and `INTERFACE` mean on a `target_*` command, and why do they matter at scale?
5. Why is a CMake/Meson toolchain/cross file consumed at *configure* time rather than build time?
6. You're choosing a build tool for a new C++ *library* meant for wide reuse. What's the decisive factor, and what do you likely pick?

---

## Cheat Sheet

```
MAKE'S TWO ASSUMPTIONS (every bug violates one)
  1. declared deps are COMPLETE   → undeclared header/flag/tool = stale-but-green
  2. mtime == content change      → clock skew, sub-second granularity, VCS checkout
  validate: diff `make` (incremental) vs `make clean && make`

DESCENDANTS vs THE MTIME PROXY
  Make   : mtime
  Ninja  : mtime + recorded command line (flag change → rebuild)
  Bazel  : content hash + hermetic declared inputs   (see ../05)

NON-RECURSIVE MAKE
  one process, `include subdir/module.mk`, paths relative to TOP
  → complete graph, correct order, full -j  (vs recursive: fragmented, slow, wrong)

CMAKE THREE PHASES
  configure  cmake -S . -B build   parse+probe → CMakeCache.txt
  generate   (same command)        → build.ninja / Makefile
  build      cmake --build build   run it
  cache corrupt? → rm -rf build && re-configure   (never repair)
  ALWAYS out-of-source (-B build)

MODERN CMAKE (target-based)
  target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE json)
  target_include_directories(json PUBLIC include PRIVATE src)
  PRIVATE  = build this only      INTERFACE = consumers only      PUBLIC = both
  AVOID global include_directories() / CMAKE_*_FLAGS

CROSS-COMPILE
  cmake --toolchain arm64.cmake     (consumed at CONFIGURE time)
  set CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_{LIBRARY,INCLUDE} ONLY  (no host leakage)
  Meson: --cross-file

CHOOSING
  consume-by-others C/C++  → CMake (ecosystem)
  greenfield, readability  → Meson
  small, Make-fluent, Unix → non-recursive Make
  always backend           → Ninja (never hand-written)
  huge polyglot/hermetic   → Bazel/Buck (../05)
```

---

## Summary

- Make's correctness rests on two assumptions — **complete declared dependencies** and **mtime ≈ content change** — and *every* Make bug is one being violated. The dangerous class is **stale-but-green**: undeclared headers/flags/tools producing a wrong artifact that reports success. Validate with incremental-vs-clean diffs.
- **Non-recursive Make** (one process, `include`d fragments, one complete graph) is the correct pattern but expensive to hand-maintain — past a point, generate instead.
- **Ninja's minimalism is its strategy**: by forbidding build-time computation it guarantees a complete, precomputed graph, enabling sub-second no-op builds and full-core parallelism. It also records command lines, closing Make's flag-change hole.
- **CMake has three phases** — configure (probe + build graph, cached in `CMakeCache.txt`), generate (emit Ninja/Make), build. Most CMake pain is phase confusion or cache corruption; the fix for the latter is to delete and re-configure.
- **Modern target-based CMake** uses `target_*` with `PUBLIC`/`PRIVATE`/`INTERFACE` usage requirements that propagate along edges — encapsulation for the build graph, and what makes CMake scale.
- **Meson** is the "start-over" design: a restricted, declarative DSL, Ninja-only, sane defaults — cleaner than CMake but with smaller ecosystem gravity.
- **Choosing** turns on concrete axes: consumers (libraries-for-others lean CMake for `find_package`), team fluency, platforms, and scale (huge polyglot/hermetic → Bazel/Buck). Name the axis; the answer follows.

The [professional.md](professional.md) page takes this into the field: maintaining and migrating large Make/CMake codebases, CMake at org scale (`find_package`, exported targets, package config), cross-platform realities, when to escape to Bazel, and the war stories that teach what the docs don't.
