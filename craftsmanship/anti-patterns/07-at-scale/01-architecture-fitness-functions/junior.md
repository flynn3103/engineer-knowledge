## Introduction

> Focus: **What is a fitness function?** and **Why automate "module A must not import module B"?**

You already know how to spot a bad shape in one file — a God Object, a circular dependency, a layer reaching into a layer it shouldn't. The problem is that *spotting* is a one-time act done by one person, and a codebase is edited by many people, forever. The rule "the web layer must never call the database directly" is true on Monday, agreed in a meeting on Tuesday, and quietly violated on Thursday by someone who never saw the meeting.

An **architecture fitness function** closes that gap. It is **an automated test that checks the *shape* of the code** — which module imports which, how deep a package nests, whether a layer is bypassed — and **fails the build** when the shape drifts toward the thing you agreed to avoid. The agreement stops being a sentence on a wiki and becomes a red CI check that blocks the merge.

The name comes from evolutionary biology by way of *Building Evolutionary Architectures*: a fitness function measures how close a system is to the characteristic you want it to keep. Here the characteristic is structural — "the dependency graph points the right way" — and the function is just a test you can run.

> **The mindset shift:** a normal test asserts *what the code does* (`add(2, 2) == 4`). A fitness function asserts *what the code is allowed to look like* (`package web does not import package db`). Both fail the build. Only one of them notices when a teammate quietly couples two things that should stay apart.

At the junior level your goal is to understand **what** a fitness function is, write the **simplest** one (a single forbidden dependency), and run it in three ecosystems. Designing a whole suite for a real codebase is `senior.md`; making the checks fast and trustworthy is `professional.md`.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can read and write code in at least one of Go, Java, or Python (examples use all three).
- **Required:** You understand `import` / `package` — what it means for one file to depend on another module.
- **Required:** You've run a unit test and seen it pass and fail. A fitness function *is* a test.
- **Helpful:** You've seen a CI pipeline turn red and block a merge. That red check is where a fitness function does its job.
- **Helpful:** You've felt the pain of an anti-pattern at least once — a "quick" import that coupled two things that should have stayed apart ([Coupling & State](../../02-design/02-coupling-and-state/professional.md) is the in-the-file view of what we now enforce from outside).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Fitness function** | An automated check that asserts a structural / architectural property of the code and fails the build when it's violated. |
| **Structural test** | A test about the *shape* of the code (dependencies, naming, nesting) rather than its runtime behavior. |
| **Forbidden dependency** | A rule that says "package A must not depend on package B" — the simplest fitness function. |
| **Layer** | A horizontal slice of an app (e.g. `web` → `service` → `repository`) with rules about which slice may call which. |
| **Dependency graph** | The directed graph of "X imports Y" across your modules. Fitness functions are assertions about this graph. |
| **Cycle** | A loop in the dependency graph (A → B → A). Almost always a smell; easy to detect and forbid. |
| **CI gate** | A check in continuous integration that blocks a merge when it fails. A fitness function only bites if it's a gate. |
| **ArchUnit / import-linter / madge** | The "hello world" tools for fitness functions in Java, Python, and JS/TS. Go usually uses `go list` plus a small custom check. |

## A Test for the Shape, Not the Output

Hold two tests side by side. They look similar — both are functions the test runner executes, both pass or fail — but they assert completely different things.

```python
# A BEHAVIORAL test: asserts what the code DOES at runtime.
def test_total_includes_tax():
    cart = Cart(items=[Item(price=100)])
    assert cart.total(tax_rate=0.1) == 110      # about the OUTPUT
```

```python
# A FITNESS FUNCTION (structural test): asserts what the code IS ALLOWED to look like.
# Using import-linter's API directly to make the idea concrete:
def test_web_does_not_import_db():
    graph = build_import_graph("shop")
    assert not graph.find_path(                  # about the SHAPE
        importer="shop.web", imported="shop.db"
    ), "shop.web must not import shop.db — go through the service layer"
```

The behavioral test would still pass if someone made `web` import `db` directly — the totals are still correct, the tax still adds up. Nothing about the *output* changed. What changed is the *shape*: a layer was bypassed, and the next person who needs to swap the database now has a hidden dependency to untangle.

A fitness function is the test that notices that. It never touches a cart or a tax rate. It loads the dependency graph and asserts a property of it.

> Behavioral tests protect **correctness**. Fitness functions protect **structure**. A codebase with green behavioral tests can still be rotting — the rot just isn't a wrong answer, it's a wrong shape. That's exactly the kind of decay no behavioral test will ever catch.

---

## The Simplest Rule: A Forbidden Dependency

Every fitness-function journey starts with one rule:

> **Package A must not import package B.**

This single shape covers a huge fraction of real architecture rules, because most layering and isolation rules are forbidden dependencies in disguise:

| Architecture intent | The forbidden dependency |
|---|---|
| "The web layer can't touch the DB directly." | `web` must not import `db` |
| "Domain logic must not depend on the framework." | `domain` must not import `spring` / `django` / `gin` |
| "No module may import the `legacy` package." | `*` must not import `legacy` |
| "The `payment` and `audit` modules must not form a cycle." | `payment` must not import `audit` **and** vice-versa |

Pick one real rule your codebase already wants — most teams have at least the first one — and that's your first fitness function. You are not boiling the ocean; you are writing *one* assertion about *one* edge that should not exist in the dependency graph.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    W[web] --> S[service]
    S --> R[repository]
    R --> DB[(database)]
    W -. "FORBIDDEN: skips the service layer" .-> DB
```

The dotted edge is what the fitness function forbids. If it appears, the build goes red.

---

## Hello, World — Three Tools

Here is the *same* rule — "the web layer must not import the data layer" — written as a runnable check in three ecosystems. Don't memorize the APIs; notice that all three do the same thing: build the dependency graph, assert an edge is absent, fail if it's present.

### Java — ArchUnit

ArchUnit is a plain JUnit test. It scans compiled classes, builds the dependency graph, and lets you assert rules in a fluent DSL. Because it's *just a test*, it runs everywhere your tests already run — no extra CI plumbing.

```java
// src/test/java/com/shop/ArchitectureTest.java
import com.tngtech.archunit.junit.AnalyzeClasses;
import com.tngtech.archunit.junit.ArchTest;
import com.tngtech.archunit.lang.ArchRule;
import static com.tngtech.archunit.lang.syntax.ArchRuleDefinition.noClasses;

@AnalyzeClasses(packages = "com.shop")          // scan this package tree
class ArchitectureTest {

    @ArchTest
    static final ArchRule web_must_not_touch_db =
        noClasses().that().resideInAPackage("..web..")
            .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAPackage("..db..");
    // Reads almost like English: no web class should depend on a db class.
}
```

### Python — import-linter

`import-linter` reads a config file describing your allowed/forbidden imports, then `lint-imports` checks it. The "forbidden" contract type is the hello-world rule.

```ini
# setup.cfg  (or .importlinter)
[importlinter]
root_package = shop

[importlinter:contract:web-not-db]
name = Web layer must not import the db layer
type = forbidden
source_modules =
    shop.web
forbidden_modules =
    shop.db
```

```bash
lint-imports            # exits non-zero (fails CI) if shop.web imports shop.db
```

### JS/TS — madge (and dependency-cruiser)

For polyglot repos, `madge` is the one-liner for the most common rule of all — *no cycles* — and `dependency-cruiser` expresses richer forbidden-edge rules. `madge --circular` is the "hello world" of fitness functions in the JS world because it needs zero config.

```bash
# Fail the build if any import cycle exists anywhere under src/
npx madge --circular --extensions ts,tsx src/
```

### Go — `go list` + a tiny check

Go forbids *import cycles* at compile time, so you get the no-cycles rule for free. For "layer A must not import layer B," a few lines over `go list` is the idiomatic hello-world; richer rules later use ArchUnit-style libraries or `go vet` analyzers.

```bash
# Fail if anything in .../web imports .../db
go list -deps ./web/... | grep -q 'myapp/db' \
  && { echo "FORBIDDEN: web imports db"; exit 1; } \
  || echo "ok: web does not import db"
```

All four answer the same question — *does a forbidden edge exist in the dependency graph?* — and all four exit non-zero (red CI) when it does.

## Why a Wiki Rule Is Not Enforcement

It is tempting to think you already *have* this rule: it's on the architecture wiki, it's in the onboarding doc, the tech lead mentions it in reviews. Why automate it?

Because none of those is **enforcement** — they're all **hope**.

| "Enforcement" by hope | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| **Wiki page / ADR** | Nobody re-reads the wiki before each commit. New hires never saw it. It silently goes stale. |
| **Code-review comment** | Depends on the reviewer *noticing* a bad import among 400 changed lines, *this time and every time*, forever. Humans miss it — especially in a big diff at 6pm. |
| **A linter warning** | A warning that doesn't fail the build is a warning everyone scrolls past. Ten thousand warnings = zero warnings. |
| **"Everyone knows that"** | Tribal knowledge evaporates the moment the person who held it changes teams. |

A fitness function is different in exactly one way that matters: **it cannot be politely ignored.** It is not advice the reviewer might give; it is a red X that blocks the merge button. The rule is enforced by the machine, identically, on every commit, with no fatigue and no exceptions it forgot to mention.

> **The core argument:** a rule that isn't executable isn't a rule — it's a suggestion. The only architecture decisions that survive contact with a growing team and a deadline are the ones a machine checks. Everything else regresses to "whatever compiled."

This is the whole reason the chapter exists. You don't write a fitness function because you distrust your teammates; you write it because *every* team, including yours, eventually ships the import the wiki forbade — and a red build catches it in seconds, while a human catches it in months (if ever).

---

## Reading Your First Violation

When a fitness function fails, it doesn't just say "no." A good one tells you the **exact edge** that broke the rule and **why** it's forbidden. Learning to read that output is half the skill.

Here's a typical ArchUnit failure:

```
Architecture Violation [Priority: MEDIUM] -
Rule 'no classes that reside in a package '..web..'
should depend on classes that reside in a package '..db..'' was violated (1 times):
  Method <com.shop.web.OrderController.list()>
  calls method <com.shop.db.OrderRows.findAll()>
  in (OrderController.java:42)
```

Read it as three facts:

1. **Which rule broke** — `web` must not depend on `db`.
2. **The exact offending edge** — `OrderController` → `OrderRows`.
3. **Where to look** — `OrderController.java:42`.

The fix is mechanical: line 42 reached straight into the data layer, so route it through the service layer instead (the layer that *is* allowed to talk to `db`). import-linter prints the same information as an import *chain* (`shop.web.orders -> shop.db.rows`), and madge prints the *cycle* it found (`a.ts > b.ts > a.ts`). In every case the output names the edge; your job is to remove that edge, not to weaken the rule.

> **First instinct check:** when a fitness function goes red, the wrong move is to edit the *rule* to allow the new import. The right move is to fix the *code* so the forbidden edge disappears. The rule is the thing you agreed protects the architecture — relaxing it the moment it bites defeats the entire purpose. (When the rule *itself* is wrong, that's a real case too — handled deliberately in `senior.md`, not reflexively at 6pm.)

---

## Common Mistakes

Mistakes juniors make with their first fitness functions:

1. **Writing the rule but not making it a CI gate.** A fitness function that lives on your laptop and never runs in CI enforces nothing. It must fail the *shared* build, or it's just a private opinion.
2. **Confusing it with a behavioral test.** "Does the cart total work?" is not a fitness function. "Does the web layer avoid importing the db layer?" is. One checks output; the other checks shape.
3. **Relaxing the rule the instant it fails.** Adding the forbidden import to an "allowed" list to get green is undoing the rule. Fix the code, not the rule (unless the rule is genuinely wrong — a senior-level decision, not a reflex).
4. **Trying to encode the whole architecture on day one.** Start with *one* forbidden dependency that the team already agrees on. A single enforced rule beats a grand un-merged ruleset.
5. **Thinking a code-review comment is "enforcement."** Review catches the violation it happens to notice; a gate catches every violation, every time. They are not equivalent.
6. **Writing a rule no one understands.** A rule with no message (`should.not.depend...` and nothing else) produces a cryptic red build. Always attach the *why* ("go through the service layer") so the next person fixes the code instead of cursing the check.

---

## Test Yourself

1. In one sentence, what is the difference between a behavioral test and an architecture fitness function?
2. Your team's wiki says "the `domain` package must not depend on the web framework." Why is that sentence *not* enforcement, and what turns it into enforcement?
3. The rule "the `web` layer must not call the `db` layer directly" is an example of which simplest fitness-function shape? Name two other architecture intents that reduce to the same shape.
4. A fitness function and all behavioral tests are green, yet a senior engineer says the architecture just got worse. How is that possible?
5. Your ArchUnit rule fails with `OrderController calls OrderRows`. A teammate "fixes" it by adding `..web..` to the rule's allowed packages and the build goes green. What's wrong with that fix?
6. Why is `madge --circular` often the very first fitness function a team adds, even before any layering rules?

## Cheat Sheet

| Concept | What it means | Tool (hello-world) |
|---|---|---|
| **Fitness function** | Automated test of the code's *shape*, fails the build on drift | ArchUnit / import-linter / madge |
| **Forbidden dependency** | "A must not import B" — the simplest rule | `noClasses()...dependOnClassesThat()`, `type = forbidden` |
| **No-cycle rule** | Forbid loops in the dependency graph | `madge --circular`; Go rejects cycles at compile time |
| **Layering rule** | Web → service → repo, no upward/skip imports | ArchUnit `..web..` ↛ `..db..` |
| **CI gate** | The check that blocks the merge | exit non-zero in the pipeline |

> **One rule to remember:** *a structural rule that isn't an executable CI gate isn't a rule — it's a suggestion, and suggestions lose to deadlines.*

---

## Summary

- An **architecture fitness function** is an automated test of the code's *shape* (its dependency graph, naming, nesting) that **fails the build** when the architecture drifts toward an anti-pattern. It complements behavioral tests, which only check output.
- The **simplest** fitness function is a **forbidden dependency** — "package A must not import package B." Most layering and isolation rules reduce to this one shape.
- The same rule is one short check in every ecosystem: **ArchUnit** (Java), **import-linter** (Python), **madge / dependency-cruiser** (JS/TS), and **`go list` + a tiny script** (Go). All build the dependency graph and assert a forbidden edge is absent.
- A **wiki page, an ADR, a review comment, or "everyone knows"** is *hope*, not enforcement. Only a **CI gate** enforces a rule identically on every commit, with no fatigue and no exceptions.
- When a fitness function fails, **read the named edge and fix the code** — don't relax the rule to go green. Always give the rule a message that explains *why*.
- Next: [`middle.md`](middle.md) — *writing real layered-architecture rules, no-cycle and naming gates, and wiring them into CI so a violation actually fails the build.*
