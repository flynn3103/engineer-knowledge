## Introduction

> Focus: **Why a rewrite usually fails; what a seam is.**

You will, sooner than you expect, be handed code that everyone hates. It's old, tangled, badly named, and slow. The obvious move feels like: *throw it away and rewrite it properly.* That instinct is almost always wrong, and this topic is about what to do instead.

The professional answer is to **replace legacy code in small slices while it keeps working** — never in one dramatic switch-over. Two ideas make that possible:

- **The Strangler Fig** — a strategy. You grow the new system *around* the old one, move one piece of work at a time onto the new code, and delete the old piece once nothing calls it. The old system shrinks slice by slice until it's gone.
- **A Seam** — a technique. A seam is a place where you can **change what code does without editing that code in the place it runs.** Seams are what let you insert the new behavior beside the old.

At the junior level you don't plan whole migrations yet — that's [`senior.md`](senior.md). Your job is to *understand why the big rewrite is a trap* and to *recognize and create a seam* in the small piece of code in front of you today.

> **The mindset shift:** "rewrite" sounds like progress and feels heroic; it is usually the riskiest thing you can do. The slow, boring, slice-by-slice replacement is the one that actually ships.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write functions, classes, and interfaces in at least one language (examples here use Java, Go, and Python).
- **Required:** You understand what an *interface* (or abstract type / protocol) is — a contract that hides which concrete implementation is behind it.
- **Helpful:** You've worked with **legacy code** at least once — code you were scared to change because you couldn't predict what would break.
- **Helpful:** Basic familiarity with unit tests; later levels lean on tests heavily.

## Why the Rewrite Almost Always Fails

The "let's just rewrite it" plan fails for reasons that have very little to do with how good a programmer you are:

1. **The old system is the spec.** Years of bug fixes, edge cases, and "we handle this weird customer" logic live *only* in the old code. Nobody wrote them down. A rewrite from the visible requirements quietly drops all of them, and you rediscover each one as a production incident.
2. **You can't ship until it's 100% done.** A rewrite delivers *zero* value until the day it fully replaces the old system. For months you have two codebases, double the bugs, and nothing to show. Meanwhile the old system keeps changing — so you're chasing a moving target.
3. **"Second-system" bloat.** Given a blank page, teams pile in every feature they always wanted. The rewrite balloons, the deadline slips, and management eventually cancels it — leaving you with the old system *plus* a half-finished new one.
4. **Big-bang cutover is terrifying.** Flipping everything to the new system on one night means if anything is wrong, *everything* is wrong, and rollback means reverting the whole world.

The incremental approach inverts every one of these: it ships value continuously, keeps the old behavior as a living reference, and makes each step small enough to verify and undo.

## The Strangler Fig Metaphor

The name comes from a real plant. A **strangler fig** seed sprouts in the canopy of a host tree and sends roots down *around* the trunk. Over years the fig grows a complete structure of its own around the host. Eventually the original tree dies and rots away — and the fig is left standing, now fully self-supporting, in the exact shape of the tree it replaced.

Martin Fowler borrowed this for software:

- The **host tree** is the legacy system.
- The **new fig** is your replacement, growing *around* the old one rather than inside it.
- You **route work** over to the new structure one slice at a time.
- When **nothing uses the old piece anymore**, you delete it — the legacy "dies and rots away."

The whole point: at every moment, *something* is running and serving real traffic. You are never in a state where the old system is broken but the new one isn't ready. You grow new, route over, delete old — repeat — until the legacy is gone.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Step1["Start"]
        L1[Legacy does all the work]
    end
    subgraph Step2["Mid-migration"]
        F2[Facade] --> L2[Legacy: slices A, B]
        F2 --> N2[New: slice C]
    end
    subgraph Step3["Done"]
        F3[Facade] --> N3[New: A, B, C]
    end
```

The thin **facade** in the middle picture is doing the routing: callers talk to the facade, and *it* decides whether each request goes to the old code or the new code. That routing layer is the senior-level machinery; here, just notice that it lets old and new coexist.

## What a Seam Is

The term **seam** comes from Michael Feathers' *Working Effectively with Legacy Code*. His definition is precise and worth memorizing:

> A **seam** is a place where you can alter behavior in your program **without editing in that place.**

Read that twice. The power is *"without editing in that place."* If the only way to change what a piece of code does is to open it up and rewrite its insides, you have no seam — and legacy code is hard precisely because it's full of behavior with no seams. A seam gives you a *different* spot — a parameter, an interface, a config value — where you can swap behavior in and out.

The most common seam is an **interface (object seam).** When code calls through an interface rather than naming a concrete class, you can hand it a different implementation without touching the calling code at all:

```java
// NO seam: callers name the concrete class. To change behavior you must
// edit every call site — there's no place to swap it out.
class Report {
    void send() {
        new SmtpMailer().mail(render());   // hard-wired to SMTP
    }
}

// SEAM: callers depend on an interface. The behavior can be changed from
// OUTSIDE — by passing a different Mailer — without editing Report at all.
interface Mailer { void mail(String body); }

class Report {
    private final Mailer mailer;
    Report(Mailer mailer) { this.mailer = mailer; }   // the seam is right here
    void send() { mailer.mail(render()); }
}
```

In the second version, `Report` has a seam: the `Mailer` it receives. A test can pass a fake mailer; production can pass the real one; and tomorrow you can pass a *new* implementation — all **without editing `Report`.** That "swap from outside" ability is the foundation of every technique in this whole topic.

## A Tiny Worked Example: Wrapping a Legacy Function

Let's create a seam where there isn't one. Suppose you have a gnarly legacy pricing function you can't safely change yet, but you want to start migrating callers toward a new implementation.

**Step 1 — the legacy function, called directly everywhere:**

```go
// Legacy: 200 lines of accumulated pricing rules. Called from 30 places.
func calcPrice(order Order) int {
    // ...tax, discounts, loyalty, currency rounding, the works...
    return total
}
```

There's no seam: every caller says `calcPrice(o)` by name. To swap in new code you'd have to edit all 30 callers at once.

**Step 2 — introduce an interface (the seam):**

```go
// A seam: an interface that BOTH the old and a future new implementation satisfy.
type Pricer interface {
    Price(order Order) int
}

// Wrap the legacy function so it satisfies the interface — behavior unchanged.
type LegacyPricer struct{}
func (LegacyPricer) Price(o Order) int { return calcPrice(o) }
```

**Step 3 — make callers depend on the seam, not the function:**

```go
// Callers now hold a Pricer. They no longer name calcPrice directly.
type Checkout struct {
    pricer Pricer
}

func (c *Checkout) Total(o Order) int {
    return c.pricer.Price(o)   // goes wherever the injected Pricer points
}
```

Wire it up with `LegacyPricer` for now and nothing changes — same behavior, same output. But you've gained something huge: **the day a new implementation exists, you swap it in at one wiring point**, and no caller code changes.

```go
// Today:
checkout := &Checkout{pricer: LegacyPricer{}}

// Tomorrow, when the new one is ready and verified:
checkout := &Checkout{pricer: NewPricer{}}   // one line; callers untouched
```

That single swappable point is your strangler fig in miniature: old behavior wrapped, callers routed through a seam, new implementation ready to grow in. The senior level scales this from one function to a whole subsystem.

## Seams You Already Have

You don't always have to *build* a seam — many already exist in code that was written with normal good practices. Recognizing them is half the skill:

| Seam | Where the swap happens | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Object / interface seam** | Pass a different implementation of an interface | The `Mailer` and `Pricer` examples above |
| **Parameter seam** | Pass a different function or value as an argument | `sort(items, byPrice)` vs `sort(items, byName)` |
| **Config / flag seam** | Flip a setting read at startup | `USE_NEW_PRICER=true` chooses the implementation |
| **Subclass / override seam** | Override a method in a subclass (or test double) | A test subclass overrides `now()` to return a fixed time |

The richest seam is the object seam, because it swaps a whole bundle of behavior cleanly. If you take one habit from this file, make it this: **depend on interfaces, inject implementations.** Code written that way is *already* ready to be strangled.

## The Vocabulary You'll Hear

You'll meet these words in standups and design docs. Here's the junior-level gist; deeper levels unpack each.

- **Branch by Abstraction** — the disciplined recipe for swapping an implementation behind a seam: add the abstraction, move every caller to it, build the new implementation, flip the seam, delete the old. Full walkthrough in [`middle.md`](middle.md).
- **Characterization test** (a.k.a. *golden-master* test) — a test that captures *what the legacy code does right now*, even if that behavior is weird. You write it *before* you change anything, so you'll know the instant your change alters behavior. Also in [`middle.md`](middle.md).
- **Parallel run / shadow** — run the old and new implementations *side by side* on real input and compare their outputs, without the new one affecting users. It's how you build confidence that "new == old" before cutting over. Covered in [`senior.md`](senior.md) and [`professional.md`](professional.md).

## Common Mistakes

1. **Reaching for the rewrite.** "It'd be faster to start fresh" is the single most expensive sentence in software. Default to incremental; justify a rewrite only when the slice-by-slice path is genuinely impossible.
2. **Confusing a seam with a code edit.** If your plan to change behavior is "open the file and rewrite the body," that's not a seam — that's editing in place, with all the risk that entails. A seam changes behavior *from outside.*
3. **Hard-wiring concrete classes.** `new SmtpMailer()` inside a method destroys the seam you could have had. Depend on the interface; receive the implementation.
4. **Changing behavior while creating the seam.** Introducing the seam (wrapping legacy behind an interface) must be a *pure refactor* — same behavior, byte for byte. "Improve it while I'm in here" is how a safe step becomes a bug.
5. **Deleting the old code too early.** The old path is your safety net and your spec. Delete it only when you've verified nothing uses it — not the moment the new code compiles.

---

## Test Yourself

1. In one sentence each, give two concrete reasons a big-bang rewrite of a legacy system usually fails.
2. State Michael Feathers' definition of a *seam.* What four words make it powerful?
3. Why is an interface a seam but a directly-called concrete class is not?
4. You have `func calcTax(o Order) int` called directly from 20 places, and you want to start migrating to a new tax engine. What is the *first* step, and why does it not change any behavior?
5. A teammate says: "While I'm wrapping the legacy pricer behind an interface, I'll also fix that rounding bug I spotted." Why is that a bad idea *in this step*?

## Cheat Sheet

| Concept | One-line meaning | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Big-bang rewrite** | Throw it all away, build fresh, switch over once | Usually fails: loses the spec, ships late, scary cutover |
| **Strangler Fig** | Grow new around old; route work over slice by slice; delete old when unused | Always something running; each step small + reversible |
| **Seam** | A place to change behavior *without editing in place* | The mechanism that lets old + new coexist |
| **Object seam** | Depend on an interface; inject the implementation | Swap whole behaviors from outside — the richest seam |
| **Wrap the legacy** | Put old code behind an interface unchanged | Creates a seam where there was none, with zero behavior change |

> **One rule to remember:** *Don't rewrite — strangle. And before you can strangle anything, find or make a seam.*

## Summary

- The instinct to **rewrite** legacy code is almost always a trap: rewrites lose the undocumented spec, deliver no value until fully done, bloat with new features, and end in a terrifying all-or-nothing cutover.
- The **Strangler Fig** is the alternative: grow the new system *around* the old, route work over one slice at a time, and delete each old piece once nothing uses it — so something always works and every step is small and reversible.
- A **seam** is a place where you can change behavior *without editing in that place.* It is the technique that lets old and new code coexist. The richest seam is the **object seam**: depend on an interface, inject the implementation.
- You create a seam by **wrapping legacy code behind an interface as a pure refactor** — no behavior change — then routing callers through the interface, so a new implementation can be swapped in later at one point.
- At this level you recognize *why* incremental beats big-bang and you can *make a seam* in a small piece of code. Next: [`middle.md`](middle.md) — *introduce a seam methodically with Branch by Abstraction, and pin the legacy's current behavior with characterization tests before you touch it.*
