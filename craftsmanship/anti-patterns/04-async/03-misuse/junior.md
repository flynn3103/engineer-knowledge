## Introduction

> Focus: **What does it look like?** and **Why is it bad?**

The other async anti-patterns are about errors that vanish or code that runs differently than it reads. These two are different: the code is usually *correct*, it just does **needless extra work** and **lies about its own nature**. They are the async equivalent of writing `if (x == true)` instead of `if (x)` — not a bug, but a sign the author hasn't quite internalized how the tool works.

Both come from the same misunderstanding: treating `Promise` (and `async`) as magic incantations you sprinkle on for safety, rather than precise tools with a specific job.

- **Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern** — you already *have* a Promise, but you wrap it inside a brand-new `new Promise(...)` "to be safe." This adds nothing and silently throws your error handling away.
- **`async` Without `await`** — you mark a function `async` even though it never `await`s anything, so it pays for asynchrony it never uses and advertises behavior it doesn't have.

At the junior level your goal is to **recognize both on sight**, understand *why* the extra machinery is wasted (and in the first case, dangerous), and apply the one-line fix: **return the Promise you already have**, and **only write `async` when you actually `await`.**

> **The mindset shift:** a `Promise` is already a complete, composable value. You don't need to "re-wrap" it to make it safe — it's safe already. And `async` is not a label that means "this is important"; it's a switch that changes how the function returns. Use it when you mean it.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can read JavaScript/TypeScript `Promise`, `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `async`/`await`.
- **Required:** You know that an `async` function always returns a `Promise`, and that `await` pauses until a Promise settles.
- **Helpful:** A basic mental model of the **microtask queue** — the idea that `.then`/`await` continuations don't run *right now*, they run *after* the current synchronous code finishes.
- **Helpful:** You've seen Python `asyncio` (`async def`, `await`, `asyncio.Future`). The same two mistakes appear there, and we show both.

If "an `async` function always returns a Promise" is new to you, read it again — it's the single fact that explains both anti-patterns.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Promise** | An object representing a value that will exist later — it's *pending*, then becomes *fulfilled* (with a value) or *rejected* (with an error). |
| **Promise constructor** | `new Promise(executor)` — the low-level way to *create* a brand-new Promise from scratch. |
| **Executor** | The function `(resolve, reject) => { ... }` you pass to `new Promise`. It runs **synchronously, immediately**, and is meant to start some operation that later calls `resolve` or `reject`. |
| **`resolve` / `reject`** | The two callbacks the executor receives. `resolve(value)` fulfills the Promise; `reject(error)` rejects it. |
| **`thenable`** | Any object with a `.then()` method — Promises are thenables. `resolve(aPromise)` *adopts* the inner Promise's eventual state. |
| **Microtask** | A small unit of work (a `.then`/`await` continuation) the engine runs after the current synchronous stack empties, before the next timer or I/O event. |
| **Microtask hop** | The unavoidable one-tick delay before a Promise continuation runs. `async`/`await` schedules at least one. Cheap, but not free. |
| **Deferred** | An object that exposes a Promise plus its `resolve`/`reject` from the outside. A common (usually unnecessary) wrapper pattern that leads people into the Promise constructor anti-pattern. |

---

## The Two at a Glance

| Anti-pattern | One-line symptom | The smell you feel |
|---|---|---|
| **Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern** | `new Promise(res => existingPromise.then(res))` | "Why are we re-wrapping a Promise we already have?" |
| **`async` Without `await`** | `async function f() { return x; }` — no `await` inside | "What is the `async` even doing here?" |

Neither is spotted by a crash. You spot them by the *shape*: a `new Promise` wrapped around something that's already a Promise, or an `async` keyword on a function whose body never `await`s. Read each section for the shape, why it's wasteful (and sometimes unsafe), and the fix.

---

## Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern

### What it looks like

You have a function that already returns a Promise — `fetchUser(id)`. For some reason, someone wraps it in a fresh `new Promise`:

```js
// JavaScript — the Promise constructor anti-pattern
function getUser(id) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fetchUser(id).then((user) => {
      resolve(user);
    });
  });
}
```

`fetchUser(id)` **is already a Promise**. The surrounding `new Promise(...)` does nothing but copy its fulfilled value across — at the cost of extra code, an extra object, an extra microtask hop, and (the real danger) a hole where error handling used to be.

The fix is almost insultingly short — **return the Promise you already have:**

```js
// Fixed — just return it
function getUser(id) {
  return fetchUser(id);
}
```

The same behavior, no wrapper, and — crucially — rejections still propagate.

#### The "deferred" variant

The same anti-pattern wears a fancier costume. A **deferred** pulls `resolve`/`reject` out of the executor so they can be called from elsewhere:

```js
// JavaScript — a hand-rolled "deferred" wrapping an existing Promise
function getUser(id) {
  let resolve, reject;
  const promise = new Promise((res, rej) => { resolve = res; reject = rej; });
  fetchUser(id).then(resolve, reject);   // forward to the deferred
  return promise;
}
```

This is more elaborate but identical in spirit: you built a new Promise by hand to forward another Promise into it. Again — `fetchUser(id)` already *is* the promise you want. `return fetchUser(id);`.

### Why it's bad

- **It throws away errors (the dangerous part).** Look again at the first example: it calls `.then(resolve)` but provides **no second argument and no `.catch`**. If `fetchUser` *rejects*, nothing calls `reject`. The outer Promise stays **pending forever** — your `await getUser(id)` hangs and never resolves, and the original error is lost. The "safe-looking" wrapper is actually *less* safe than the one-liner it replaced.

  ```js
  // The lost-error trap: fetchUser rejects → outer Promise hangs forever
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    fetchUser(id).then(resolve);   // no reject path — rejection vanishes
  });
  ```

- **It's pure overhead even when correct.** Suppose someone "fixes" it by passing both handlers (`fetchUser(id).then(resolve, reject)`). Now errors propagate — but you've still allocated a second Promise and added a second microtask hop to forward a value that was already in a Promise. You wrote five lines to do what `return` does in one.

- **It hides intent.** A reader sees `new Promise` and assumes you're bridging some *non-Promise* source (a callback, an event). When the body is just another Promise, they waste time looking for the thing that isn't there.

```mermaid

    A["fetchUser(id)<br/>already a Promise"] -->|"return it"| OK["caller gets the Promise<br/>errors propagate ✓"]
    A -->|"wrap in new Promise<br/>(.then resolve only)"| BAD["extra object + hop<br/>rejection lost ✗"]
```

### When `new Promise` IS correct

`new Promise` is not banned — it is the **right and only** tool for *creating* a Promise from something that **isn't a Promise yet**: a callback-based API, an event, or a timer. The rule is narrow: **use `new Promise` to bridge a non-Promise source into the Promise world; never to wrap a value that's already a Promise.**

```js
// CORRECT — wrapping a callback API (no Promise exists yet to return)
function readFilePromise(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(path, "utf8", (err, data) => {
      if (err) reject(err);     // both paths handled — note the reject!
      else resolve(data);
    });
  });
}

// CORRECT — wrapping a timer (setTimeout has no Promise of its own)
const delay = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
```

In both, there was **no Promise to begin with** — `fs.readFile` and `setTimeout` speak callbacks. That's the legitimate job of the constructor. (In Node you'd often reach for `util.promisify(fs.readFile)`, which does this same wrapping for you correctly.)

### Python `asyncio` analog

The same misuse appears when people wrap an existing awaitable in a new coroutine or `Future` for no reason:

```python
# Python — needless wrapping of an awaitable
async def get_user(id):
    fut = asyncio.Future()
    async def _forward():
        fut.set_result(await fetch_user(id))   # forwards result, but...
    asyncio.create_task(_forward())             # ...drops the error path
    return await fut

# Fixed — fetch_user is already awaitable; just await/return it
async def get_user(id):
    return await fetch_user(id)
```

And just like JS, the constructor *is* the right tool when bridging a callback-style API into `asyncio` — `loop.create_future()` + a callback that calls `fut.set_result(...)` / `fut.set_exception(...)` is the canonical adapter. The rule is identical: wrap a **non-awaitable** source, never an awaitable you already hold.

> **Smell test:** if a `new Promise` executor's body contains a `.then(...)` (or your "deferred" forwards another Promise), you almost certainly want to delete the wrapper and `return` the inner Promise. Ask: *"Is the thing inside already a Promise?"* If yes → drop the constructor.

## `async` Without `await`

### What it looks like

A function is marked `async`, but its body never `await`s anything — it's all synchronous work:

```js
// JavaScript — async with nothing to await
async function double(x) {
  return x * 2;          // no await anywhere
}
```

Or a function that has *one* call it could just return, dressed up with `async`/`await` for no gain:

```js
async function getConfig() {
  return await loadConfig();   // await-then-return-immediately: pointless await
}
```

The fixes match the cause. If there's genuinely no asynchronous work, **drop `async`:**

```js
// Fixed — it's a plain synchronous function
function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}
```

If the function only forwards another Promise, you don't need `async`/`await` *or* the wrapper — just return:

```js
// Fixed — return the Promise directly (no async, no await)
function getConfig() {
  return loadConfig();
}
```

### Why it's bad

- **It pays a microtask hop for nothing.** An `async` function *always* returns a Promise, and resolving it costs at least one trip through the microtask queue. `double(2)` could be the number `4` immediately; as written it's a `Promise<4>` that the caller must `await`. You've turned a free synchronous answer into a deferred one — tiny per call, but real in hot loops, and it forces every caller to become async too (the "async creeps up the call stack" effect).

- **It changes the return type and lies about it.** `async function double(x)` returns `Promise<number>`, not `number`. Every caller now has to `await double(2)`. The `async` keyword signaled "this does async work — `await` me," but it does no async work. The signature is now misleading.

  ```js
  const n = double(2);          // n is Promise<2>... not 4
  console.log(n * 2);           // NaN — multiplying a Promise
  ```

- **`return await x` specifically is a code smell.** When you immediately `await` the only call and return it, the `await` adds an extra hop and (historically) muddied stack traces, with no benefit. `return loadConfig();` is simpler and lets the caller's `await` do the waiting. *(There is one narrow exception — see Common Mistakes — but it does not apply to a one-liner like this.)*

> **Note — not every `async` without a literal `await` is wrong.** Marking a function `async` *can* be a deliberate, valid choice: it forces the return value to be a Promise (handy for a consistent interface) and turns any `throw` inside into a rejection rather than a synchronous exception. The anti-pattern is the *thoughtless* case — `async` added as decoration on plain synchronous work, where it only buys overhead and a confusing signature. If you can't name a reason the result *must* be a Promise, drop the keyword.

### Python `asyncio` analog

Identical idea: `async def` with no `await` inside still produces a **coroutine object**, which does nothing until it's awaited or scheduled — easy to forget, easy to break.

```python
# Python — async def with no await
async def double(x):
    return x * 2          # no await; this is just sync work in disguise

double(2)                 # returns a coroutine, NOT 4 — and warns "never awaited"

# Fixed — a plain function
def double(x):
    return x * 2
```

The failure mode is sharper in Python: calling `double(2)` and using the result as a number doesn't quietly give `Promise<4>` — it gives a coroutine object and usually a `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'double' was never awaited`. The cure is the same: if there's nothing to `await`, it's not a coroutine — make it a normal `def`.

> **Smell test:** scan the body of every `async` function for an `await`. None there? Either the function should not be `async`, or it should genuinely be awaiting something and someone forgot. Decide which — don't leave the keyword as decoration.

## How They Relate

Both are **"machinery I don't need"** mistakes, and they often appear together — the deferred/constructor wrapper is frequently *also* a needless `async` function:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    M["Misunderstanding:<br/>'async/Promise = safety I sprinkle on'"]
    M --> PCA["Promise Constructor<br/>(wrap a Promise in new Promise)"]
    M --> AWA["async Without await<br/>(async on sync work)"]
    PCA -. "the wrapper often drops .catch" .-> ERR["Swallowed Rejection<br/>(see 01-error-handling)"]
    AWA -. "forces callers to await<br/>a non-async value" .-> CONF["misleading signature"]
```

The shared root: **both treat async constructs as labels rather than tools.** A `Promise` is already a finished, composable value — you return it, you don't re-wrap it. `async` is a switch that changes how a function returns — you flip it when you `await`, not for decoration. Internalize those two facts and you stop writing both.

The Promise constructor anti-pattern also feeds directly into a *real* bug — a [Swallowed Promise Rejection](../01-error-handling/junior.md) — because the hand-written wrapper so often forgets the `reject` path. That's what makes it the more dangerous of the two.

## Quick Spotting Checklist

Run this over any async code you touch this week:

- [ ] Is there a `new Promise(...)` whose body contains a `.then(...)`? → **Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern** (return the inner Promise).
- [ ] Is there a hand-rolled `let resolve; const p = new Promise(...)` "deferred" that just forwards another Promise? → same anti-pattern.
- [ ] Does any `new Promise` wrap something that's already a Promise (rather than a callback/event/timer)? → drop the wrapper.
- [ ] Is there an `async` function with **no `await`** anywhere in its body? → **`async` Without `await`** (drop the keyword, or actually await).
- [ ] Do you see `return await x;` as the whole body? → drop `async`/`await`, just `return x;`.

If you check any box, the fix is almost always *deleting* code, not adding it.

## Common Mistakes

Mistakes juniors make *around* these two anti-patterns:

1. **Wrapping a Promise "to make sure it's a Promise."** It already is one. `return existingPromise;` is complete and safe. The wrapper adds risk (lost `reject`) and overhead, never safety.
2. **Forgetting the `reject` path in a real constructor.** When you *do* legitimately use `new Promise` (a callback API), handle the error: `if (err) reject(err); else resolve(data);`. Omitting `reject` is how the constructor anti-pattern silently swallows failures.
3. **Adding `async` "because it might be async later."** Don't. Add it when you actually `await`. Speculative `async` changes the return type now and forces every caller to deal with a Promise that wraps nothing.
4. **Thinking `async` makes synchronous code faster or "non-blocking."** It does not. `async` on CPU work still runs that work synchronously on the same thread — it just defers the *result* by a microtask. It adds latency, not parallelism.
5. **Over-correcting `return await` everywhere.** `return loadConfig();` is the right default. The **one** narrow exception: inside a `try/catch`, `return await loadConfig();` is correct, because without the `await` the function returns before the rejection happens and your `catch` never fires. So: drop `await` on a bare return; *keep* it when the return is inside a `try`.
6. **Confusing the two fixes.** For the constructor anti-pattern the fix is *"return the inner Promise."* For `async`-without-`await` on sync work the fix is *"drop `async`."* When a function does *both* — wraps a Promise *and* is needlessly `async` — `return innerPromise;` (no `async`, no `await`) fixes both at once.

## Test Yourself

1. Name the two Async Misuse anti-patterns and give the one-line symptom of each.
2. What is wrong with this function, and what is the one-line fix?
   ```js
   function getOrder(id) {
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       fetchOrder(id).then((order) => resolve(order));
     });
   }
   ```
3. In question 2's code, what happens at runtime if `fetchOrder(id)` **rejects**? Why is that worse than the simple version?
4. Give one situation where `new Promise(...)` is the *correct* tool, and explain what makes it different from the anti-pattern.
5. What does `double` return here, and what will `console.log(double(5) + 1)` print? What's the fix?
   ```js
   async function double(x) { return x * 2; }
   ```
6. When is `return await something;` actually correct rather than a smell?

## Cheat Sheet

| Anti-pattern | Spot it by | Fix it with |
|---|---|---|
| **Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern** | `new Promise(...)` whose body `.then`s another Promise; hand-rolled "deferred" forwarding a Promise | `return theInnerPromise;` — never wrap an existing Promise |
| **`async` Without `await`** | `async` function with no `await`; `return await x;` as the whole body | Drop `async` (sync work) or `return x;` (forwarding a Promise) — or genuinely `await` |
| **(Legit) `new Promise`** | Wrapping a **callback / event / timer** — no Promise exists yet | Keep it — and handle *both* `resolve` **and** `reject` |
| **(Legit) `return await`** | The return is inside a `try/catch` | Keep the `await` so the local `catch` can fire |

> **One rule to remember:** *A Promise is already a complete value — return it, don't re-wrap it. `async` is a switch, not a sticker — flip it only when you `await`.*

---

## Summary

- **Async Misuse anti-patterns** are cases where the async machinery is *unnecessary* — usually not a crash, but wasted work and a misleading signature. The human signal is *"why is this here?"*
- **Promise Constructor Anti-Pattern:** wrapping an existing Promise in `new Promise` adds an extra object and microtask hop, and — most dangerously — the hand-written wrapper usually forgets the `reject` path, so rejections vanish and the outer Promise hangs forever. Fix: `return` the Promise you already have. `new Promise` is correct **only** for bridging a non-Promise source (callback, event, timer) — and then you must handle `reject` too.
- **`async` Without `await`:** marking a function `async` when it never `await`s pays a microtask hop for nothing, changes the return type to `Promise<T>`, and forces every caller to `await` a value that isn't really async. Fix: drop `async` for sync work; `return` the Promise directly when forwarding; keep `async` only when you genuinely `await` (or deliberately need a Promise/throw-as-rejection interface).
- The two share one root: **treating `async`/`Promise` as decoration rather than tools.** A Promise is already complete; `async` is a switch you flip when you `await`.
- The fixes are almost always *deletions*. The same applies in Python `asyncio`: don't wrap an awaitable in a new `Future`, and don't write `async def` with no `await`.
- Next: [`middle.md`](middle.md) — these in real services, the deferred pattern at scale, and where wrapping legitimately earns its keep.
