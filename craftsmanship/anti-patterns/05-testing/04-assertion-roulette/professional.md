# Assertion Roulette — Professional

> **Focus:** many unlabeled assertions that make failures hard to diagnose.

## What this guide builds

At the professional level, learn to **make prevention a repeatable team practice**. The goal is not perfect code; it is to make the next decision clearer and safer.

## Recognize the pattern

A failure says only that a value was wrong, not which behavior matters.

Common signals:

- The intent is hard to infer from the call site or module boundary.
- A small change creates surprising work, delay, or risk elsewhere.
- The code needs an undocumented rule to stay correct.

## A better direction

Use focused tests and assertions with clear messages or separate examples.

## Python example

```python
def test_discount_for_member():
    total = price_for(member=True, subtotal=100)
    assert total == 90, "members receive a ten-percent discount"
```

## Action checklist

- Set a shared rule, automate a useful signal, review trends, and adjust the practice from results.
- Write down the behavior or constraint that must not change.
- Prefer a small, reversible step over a broad rewrite.
- Verify the result with the fastest relevant test, check, or measurement.

## Evidence of progress

An operating practice that reduces recurrence without blocking delivery.

## Check yourself

- What observable signal tells you this anti-pattern is present?
- What is the smallest change that reduces the risk?
- How will you know the improvement preserved the required behavior?
