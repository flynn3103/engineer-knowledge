## Introduction

> Focus: **Why slow tests quietly kill the suite.**

A test suite has one job: tell you, fast, whether your change broke anything. The "fast" is not a nicety — it's the whole point. The value of a test is the feedback it gives, and feedback you get in 3 seconds shapes how you work; feedback you get in 18 minutes does not, because you've already moved on, opened a different file, lost the context.

Here is the trap, and it's almost invisible while you build it. You write a unit test for `createUser`. It needs a user in the database, so your test connects to a real Postgres, inserts a row, runs the function, asserts, deletes the row. It takes **2 seconds**. That feels fine — 2 seconds is nothing. You ship it.

Then it happens 400 more times, across the whole team, over a year.

> 400 tests × 2 seconds = **13 minutes** for a suite that should run in **8 seconds**.

Now nobody runs the suite before pushing. They push and hope, or they run "just the test I touched," or they wait for CI and context-switch away. The suite still exists. It's still green. But it has stopped doing its job, because **a test nobody runs is not a safety net** — it's a 13-minute decoration.

That's the anti-pattern. **Slow Tests** is not one broken test; it's a suite that got slow one reasonable-looking 2-second test at a time, until the team's habit changed from "run it" to "skip it."

> **The mindset shift:** a unit test that touches a real database is not a slow unit test — it's a *misclassified integration test*. The speed problem is a symptom; the real problem is testing the wrong thing at the wrong layer. Fix the layer and the speed follows.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** You can write a basic unit test in at least one language (examples here use Go, Java with JUnit 5, and Python with pytest).
- **Required:** You know the difference between *your code* and a *dependency* it talks to — a database, an HTTP API, the filesystem, the clock.
- **Helpful:** You've waited for a slow CI run and felt the urge to push without running tests locally. That urge is exactly what this file is about.
- **Helpful:** Basic familiarity with the idea of a *test double* (a stand-in for a real dependency) — covered properly in the `unit-testing-patterns` and `mocking-strategies` skills.

## What "Slow" Actually Costs

The cost of a slow suite isn't the wall-clock time. It's the **behavior change** the slowness causes. Watch the chain:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Tests are slow] --> B[People run them less]
    B --> C[Feedback arrives later]
    C --> D[Bugs found later<br/>and farther from the cause]
    D --> E[Fixing costs more]
    B --> F[People skip the safety net<br/>and stop refactoring]
```

A bug caught by a unit test on your laptop costs seconds to fix — you know exactly what you just changed. The *same bug* caught in CI 20 minutes later costs minutes, because you've context-switched. Caught in a teammate's branch next week, it costs an investigation. Caught in production, it costs an incident. **Slowness pushes every bug down that chain**, toward the expensive end.

There's a second, quieter cost. A fast suite makes refactoring safe and cheap — change the code, run the tests, know in seconds whether you broke anything. A slow suite makes refactoring *expensive*, so people stop doing it, and the production code rots into the [structural anti-patterns](../../01-development/01-bad-structure/junior.md) the rest of this roadmap warns about. Slow tests don't just fail to catch bugs; they remove the safety net that keeps the whole codebase healthy.

---

## The One Cause You'll Create First: Real I/O

By far the most common way a junior creates a slow test is **doing real I/O in a unit test** — talking to a real database, a real HTTP endpoint, the real filesystem, or the real clock. I/O is *thousands of times slower* than running code in memory.

| Operation | Rough cost | Relative |
|---|---|---|
| Call a pure function | ~10 nanoseconds | 1× |
| Read in-memory map | ~50 nanoseconds | 5× |
| Round-trip to a local DB | ~1–5 **milliseconds** | ~100,000× |
| HTTP call to a real service | ~50–500 **milliseconds** | ~10,000,000× |

A unit test should exercise *your logic*, and your logic runs in memory. The database round-trip in the test below isn't testing your logic — it's testing Postgres, which already works, and paying a 100,000× speed tax to do it.

```python
# Python — a "unit" test that is secretly an integration test
import psycopg2

def test_discount_for_gold_member():
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test")          # real DB connection
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO members (id, tier) VALUES (1, 'gold')")
    conn.commit()

    result = compute_discount(conn, member_id=1)     # the thing we care about

    assert result == 0.20
    cur.execute("DELETE FROM members WHERE id = 1")   # cleanup
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
# ~30–80 ms per run. Multiply by your whole suite.
```

The logic we actually want to test is *"gold members get 20% off."* That rule lives in `compute_discount`. The database is just where the member *happens* to be stored. So **don't store it in a real database for the test** — hand the function the data directly, through a tiny in-memory stand-in (a **fake**):

```python
# Python — same logic, no I/O. Microseconds, not milliseconds.
class FakeMembers:
    def __init__(self, members):
        self._members = members
    def tier_of(self, member_id):
        return self._members[member_id]

def test_discount_for_gold_member():
    members = FakeMembers({1: "gold"})       # data in memory, visible in the test
    result = compute_discount(members, member_id=1)
    assert result == 0.20
```

This requires that `compute_discount` take its data through an interface it doesn't own (here, a `tier_of` method) rather than reaching for a global connection — which is exactly the dependency-injection habit (see Clean Code → Boundaries) that makes code testable. The test is now **microseconds**, reads top-to-bottom (no [Mystery Guest](../03-mystery-guest/junior.md) hidden in a database), and tests *your rule* instead of Postgres.

> Real databases and real HTTP calls absolutely belong in tests — just not in *unit* tests. They go in a smaller number of **integration tests** (the `integration-testing` skill), which you keep deliberately few and run on their own. That separation is the test pyramid, below.

---

## The Second Cause: `sleep`

The other slowness you'll create early is waiting with `sleep`. Something happens asynchronously — a background job, a goroutine, a callback — and you need it to finish before you assert. The tempting fix is to wait "long enough":

```go
// Go — the sleep anti-pattern
func TestJobCompletes(t *testing.T) {
    queue.Submit(job)
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second) // "should be done by now"
    if !job.Done() {
        t.Fatal("job did not complete")
    }
}
```

This is slow **and** unreliable, which is why it shows up in both this chapter and [Flaky Tests](../02-flaky-tests/junior.md). It's slow because you pay the full 2 seconds *even when the job finished in 5 ms*. It's flaky because on a loaded CI machine the job might take 2.1 seconds and the test fails for no real reason. You can't win: short sleeps are flaky, long sleeps are slow.

The fix is to **wait for the condition, not for the clock** — poll cheaply until the thing is true (or a timeout fires):

```go
// Go — await the condition; returns the instant it's true
func TestJobCompletes(t *testing.T) {
    queue.Submit(job)
    waitUntil(t, 2*time.Second, func() bool { return job.Done() })
}

func waitUntil(t *testing.T, timeout time.Duration, cond func() bool) {
    t.Helper()
    deadline := time.Now().Add(timeout)
    for time.Now().Before(deadline) {
        if cond() {
            return // success — we stop the moment it's true
        }
        time.Sleep(5 * time.Millisecond) // cheap poll, not the whole wait
    }
    t.Fatal("condition not met before timeout")
}
```

The timeout is the *ceiling* (so a real hang still fails the test), but the common case returns in milliseconds. Same correctness, a hundredth of the time, and no flakiness.

## The Test Pyramid, in One Picture

Where the I/O lesson and the layering lesson meet is the **test pyramid** (Mike Cohn, *Succeeding with Agile*; popularized by Martin Fowler). It's a budget for how many tests of each kind you should have:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E["End-to-End / UI<br/><i>few — slow, realistic, run rarely</i>"]
    I["Integration<br/><i>some — real DB/HTTP at the boundary</i>"]
    U["Unit<br/><i>many — fast, in-memory, run constantly</i>"]
    E --- I --- U
    style U fill:#2d5a2d,color:#fff
    style I fill:#5a5a2d,color:#fff
    style E fill:#5a2d2d,color:#fff
```

- **Many unit tests** — fast, in-memory, no I/O. These are the bulk. They run in seconds, so you run them constantly.
- **Some integration tests** — real database, real HTTP, real filesystem, at the boundaries. Slower, so fewer. Run before merge, not on every keystroke.
- **Few end-to-end tests** — the whole system through the front door. Slowest and most realistic; a handful for the critical flows.

The **Slow Tests** anti-pattern is what you get when this pyramid flips upside-down into an "ice-cream cone": a few unit tests on top and a huge base of slow end-to-end tests. Everything goes through every layer (and a real database), so everything is slow, and the suite takes an hour. Senior-level files cover reshaping that inverted pyramid; at your level, just don't *build* it — when you can test a rule with an in-memory fake, do, and reserve the real database for the small number of tests that genuinely need it.

---

## Fast Is a Feature

A useful target for the suite you run before every push: **under 10 seconds for the unit tests, ideally under 2.** That number isn't arbitrary — it's roughly the limit of patience. Below it, running the tests is frictionless and becomes automatic. Above it, every run is a small decision ("is it worth waiting?"), and decisions get skipped.

So treat test speed the way you treat correctness: as a property worth protecting. When a test you write does real I/O, that's a signal to ask *"is this actually a unit test?"* — and usually the answer, and the fix, is to push the I/O behind a fake and test your logic directly.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **"2 seconds is fine."** It is — once. The anti-pattern is *aggregate*: 2 seconds × the whole suite is what kills it. Always think about a test's cost multiplied by how many tests like it will exist.
2. **Putting a real database in a unit test.** If the test needs a running service to pass, it isn't a unit test. Use a fake for the unit test; keep a *few* real-DB integration tests separately.
3. **Waiting with `sleep`.** It's slow on the happy path and flaky under load. Await the condition with a polling helper and a timeout ceiling instead.
4. **Measuring the whole suite, never the parts.** "The suite takes 12 minutes" is not actionable. "These 6 tests take 9 of the 12 minutes" is. (How to find them: `middle.md`.)
5. **Assuming slow = thorough.** A slow test is not a *better* test. Realism has value (that's what integration tests are for), but a unit test that's slow is usually slow by accident, not by design.
6. **Treating speed as separate from quality.** A suite people skip catches nothing. Speed *is* part of whether the suite works at all.

---

## Test Yourself

1. A teammate says "each test only takes 1.5 seconds, that's fast." Why is this the wrong way to think about test speed?
2. You have a unit test that connects to a real Redis to check a caching rule. What's the cleaner design, and what does it require of the code under test?
3. Why is `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)` both slow *and* flaky? What replaces it?
4. In the test pyramid, which layer should have the *most* tests, and why?
5. What is the "ice-cream cone," and why does it produce a slow suite?
6. Your suite takes 15 minutes and the team has stopped running it locally. Name two distinct costs this is creating beyond the wasted 15 minutes.

## Cheat Sheet

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Unit test takes 30+ ms | Real DB / HTTP / filesystem I/O | Replace the dependency with an in-memory **fake**; inject it |
| Test waits a fixed time | `sleep`-based waiting | **Await the condition** with a polling helper + timeout ceiling |
| Whole suite takes minutes | Too many tests go through every layer | Push logic into **unit tests**; keep real-I/O tests few (pyramid) |
| Suite is green but nobody runs it | It's too slow to run before pushing | Get the unit suite **under ~10 s**; segregate the slow tests |

> **One rule to remember:** *A test's job is fast feedback. A unit test that does real I/O isn't a slow unit test — it's an integration test in the wrong place.*

---

## Summary

- A test exists to give **fast feedback**. When the suite gets slow, people run it less, bugs are caught later and farther from their cause, and refactoring stops because the safety net is too expensive to use.
- Slowness is **aggregate**: each 2-second test feels fine, but the suite is the sum. Always weigh a test's cost against how many like it will exist.
- The two causes you'll create first are **real I/O in unit tests** (replace the dependency with an in-memory fake and inject it) and **`sleep`-based waiting** (await the condition with a polling helper and a timeout ceiling).
- The **test pyramid** is the budget: many fast unit tests, some integration tests, few end-to-end. The Slow Tests anti-pattern is this pyramid flipped into an "ice-cream cone."
- Treat speed as a feature: aim for a unit suite that runs in **under ~10 seconds**, so running it stays automatic.
