# Estimation Under Uncertainty — Senior

> **What?** At the senior level, estimation under uncertainty is *decision-grade forecasting*: producing the smallest, cheapest estimate that is precise enough to make the decision at hand, expressing it as a calibrated probability distribution, and defending that distribution against the organizational gravity that wants to collapse it to its optimistic end.
>
> **How?** You match estimate precision to the *decision's* needs (two-way doors get a gut call; one-way doors get a real distribution). You calibrate yourself with measured feedback (Hubbard's calibrated-estimation work), run Monte Carlo over decomposed tasks instead of summing means, lead reference-class forecasting for the team, and turn raw uncertainty into risk-cost so it can be traded off against everything else on the table.

## Quick use
1. Match precision to reversibility and decision stakes.
2. Build a calibrated distribution from decomposed work and reference classes.
3. Convert uncertainty into risk cost for the decision-maker.

**Decision rule:** buy only the information that changes the decision.

## 1. Precision should match the decision, not the question

The most common senior mistake is over-estimating. Spending a week building a careful capacity model for a choice you can reverse in an afternoon is *waste dressed as rigor*. The right amount of estimation is a function of the **decision**, not the curiosity of the question.

| Decision type | Reversibility | Estimate precision needed |
|---|---|---|
| Pick a JSON library | Two-way door (swap later) | Gut call. 5 minutes. |
| Choose hot-path data store | One-way-ish (migration is painful) | Real Fermi + load model |
| Commit a launch date to a partner | One-way (contractual) | Full distribution, p90 committed |
| Provision a cluster size | Cheap to resize | Order-of-magnitude only |

The governing question is **"what would I do differently if the estimate were 2× higher or 2× lower?"** If the answer is "nothing," stop estimating — you've already gathered enough. This is **value-of-information** thinking: only buy precision the decision will actually use. (Hubbard's *How to Measure Anything* frames the entire measurement question this way: measure only what reduces decision-relevant uncertainty, and only until further measurement isn't worth it.)

## 2. Calibration: most engineers' "90% confident" is ~60%

A range is only honest if it's **calibrated** — your 90% intervals should contain the truth 90% of the time. Douglas Hubbard's research (and Tetlock's forecasting work) shows untrained estimators are wildly *overconfident*: their stated 90% intervals capture the answer maybe 40–60% of the time. Good news: calibration is a *trainable skill*, and the training is cheap.

### The equivalent-bet test (to widen honest intervals)

For any 90% interval you state, ask yourself: *"Would I rather (a) win $1,000 if the true value lands inside my range, or (b) win $1,000 on a spin of a wheel that pays out 90% of the time?"*

- If you prefer the **wheel**, your interval is too narrow — widen it.
- If you prefer your **range**, it's too wide — tighten it.
- When you're indifferent, you're calibrated.

### Track it organizationally

Keep an **estimate ledger** across the team:

| Period | # estimates | p90 ranges hit | Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | 40 | 26 (65%) | 90% — overconfident |
| Q2 | 38 | 31 (82%) | improving |
| Q3 | 41 | 37 (90%) | calibrated |

When the hit rate sits well below the nominal confidence, the team is overconfident and every roadmap is at risk. The fix is structural: widen intervals, then re-measure. Calibration is the difference between a range that protects you and a range that's theater.

## 3. Monte Carlo beats summing means

PERT's `E = (O+4M+P)/6` per task and summing is a fine first pass, but it has two flaws at senior scale: it assumes a specific beta distribution, and naive summing ignores that the *project* p90 is not the sum of *task* p90s. Summing pessimistic cases over-pads; summing means under-pads. The clean answer is simulation.

```python
import random

# (optimistic, most_likely, pessimistic) days per task
tasks = [(2,4,9), (3,5,12), (1,3,6), (2,4,8)]

def sample(o, m, p):
    # triangular dist: cheap, captures the right-skew, no library needed
    return random.triangular(o, p, m)   # (low, high, mode)

trials = [sum(sample(*t) for t in tasks) for _ in range(100_000)]
trials.sort()

p50 = trials[len(trials)//2]
p90 = trials[int(len(trials)*0.90)]
print(f"p50 = {p50:.1f} days   p90 = {p90:.1f} days")
# e.g. p50 ≈ 17 days   p90 ≈ 22 days
```

Now you can *commit p90 and plan p50* with numbers you can show. Two senior refinements:

- **Model correlation.** If one shared risk (flaky CI, a vendor outage) hits multiple tasks, draw a single shared factor and apply it across tasks. Independent sampling *understates* tail risk — and the tail is what kills launches.
- **Model the discrete disasters separately.** "10% chance the vendor API doesn't support batch and we rebuild ingestion (+15 days)" is not a wider triangle; it's a **bimodal** outcome. Add it as an explicit `if random.random() < 0.10: total += 15`. These low-probability, high-impact branches are exactly what point estimates erase.

This connects directly to [risk and failure probabilities](../03-risk-and-failure-probabilities/): the pessimistic tail of an estimate *is* a risk, and should be priced like one.

## 4. A fully worked capacity estimate (decision-grade)

> **Scenario.** Product wants to add full-text search over user documents. Before committing to a managed Elasticsearch tier vs. building on Postgres, you need: index size, query QPS, and a rough monthly cost — accurate to an order of magnitude, in an hour, not a sprint.

**Step 1 — Corpus size (index storage).**
```
Users:                       5,000,000
Active users with docs:      20%        → 1,000,000
Avg docs per active user:    50
Total docs:                  1,000,000 × 50 = 5×10^7 docs
Avg doc text:                10 KB
Raw text:                    5×10^7 × 10 KB = 5×10^11 B = 500 GB
Inverted-index overhead:     ~1.5× raw   → ~750 GB index
```
**Index ≈ 0.75 TB.** That fits comfortably in a mid-size managed cluster — *not* an exotic problem. First decision input secured.

**Step 2 — Query load.**
```
Searches/active user/day:    5
Searches/day:                1,000,000 × 5 = 5×10^6/day
Average QPS:                 5×10^6 / 8.64×10^4 ≈ 58 QPS
Peak (×5 for business hours): ≈ 300 QPS
```
**~60 QPS average, ~300 QPS peak.** A single well-tuned node handles this for simple queries; you size for redundancy, not throughput. Second input secured.

**Step 3 — Rough monthly cost (the actual decision driver).**
```
Hot index 0.75 TB + replica = 1.5 TB across, say, 3 nodes
Managed search node (~30 GB RAM, decent CPU): ~$300/mo each
3 nodes:                     ~$900/mo
+ ingest/snapshot overhead:  ~$1,100/mo all-in
```
**~$1k/month, order of magnitude 10^3 $/mo.** Now the decision is framed precisely: managed search costs ~$13k/year; the build-on-Postgres alternative trades that for engineering time and weaker relevance. That is a *clean two-option trade*, surfaced in an hour — and the estimate's job is done the moment it makes the choice obvious. The decompose-from-fundamentals move here is [first-principles reasoning](../../05-first-principles-thinking/01-reasoning-from-fundamentals/).

Always state the **load-bearing assumptions** (20% active, 50 docs each, 10 KB avg) so anyone can challenge the *inputs* rather than the conclusion. An estimate whose assumptions are visible is debuggable; one that isn't, is dogma.

## 5. Reference-class forecasting as a team practice

The senior version of fighting the planning fallacy is institutional: make the outside view the *default* for any non-trivial estimate.

1. **Build the reference classes.** Tag completed epics by size (S/M/L/XL) and store their *actuals*. This is your forecasting gold.
2. **For a new epic, start from the class distribution**, not from imagination. "Last 8 L-epics ran median 6 weeks, p90 11 weeks" is the anchor.
3. **Adjust for genuine specifics**, with the burden of proof on any claim that *this one* is faster than its class.
4. **Re-anchor as the cone narrows** — re-forecast at each phase boundary, not just at kickoff.

Flyvbjerg's megaproject research found reference-class forecasting is the single most reliable corrective to systematic optimism. The inside view *feels* more accurate because it's detailed; the outside view *is* more accurate because it's data. When they disagree, lead with the data and let specifics adjust it.

## 6. Defending a range without it collapsing

You will give "5–9 weeks" and a stakeholder will repeat "so, 5 weeks." Holding the range is a senior skill in itself.

| Pressure | Senior response |
|---|---|
| "Just give me one number." | "The one number you can plan against is the p90: **9 weeks.** The 5 is the lucky case — don't build the plan on it." |
| "Can you commit to the optimistic end?" | "I can commit to p90. Committing to p50 means we miss half the time by design." |
| "The range is too wide." | "The width is real — it's where we are on the cone. Fund a 1-week spike and I'll halve it." |
| "Competitor X ships in 4 weeks." | "Then we're choosing scope, not estimate. Here's what fits in 4 weeks at p90." |

The meta-move: **never surrender the distribution, trade scope instead.** Estimates are about *when you'll be done with this scope*; if the date is fixed, the variable that moves is scope or confidence, never the laws of probability. Anchoring the conversation on **p90 as the commit and p50 as the hope** stops the silent collapse to the optimistic end before it starts.

### Takeaways

1. **Match precision to the decision** — stop estimating once a 2× swing wouldn't change your choice (value of information).
2. **Calibrate explicitly** — untrained 90% intervals capture ~50%; widen with the equivalent-bet test and track hit rate.
3. **Monte Carlo, not summed means** — and model correlation and discrete disasters explicitly; the tail is what hurts.
4. A decision-grade estimate states its **load-bearing assumptions** so the inputs, not the conclusion, are what get argued.
5. **Defend the distribution** by trading scope — commit p90, hope p50, never let the range collapse to its floor.

## Recall and apply

Try to answer these questions from memory:

1. A stakeholder asks you to commit to the optimistic end of your range. What do you say?
2. How should the precision of an estimate relate to the decision?
3. Estimate the monthly bandwidth cost to serve a 2 MB page to 10 million visitors/day. (Worked Fermi)
4. What is Hofstadter's Law and what does it imply about padding?
