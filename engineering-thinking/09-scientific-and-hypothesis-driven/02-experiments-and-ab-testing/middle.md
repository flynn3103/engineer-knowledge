# Experiments and A/B Testing — Middle

> **What?** The quantitative core of an A/B test: a **metric** you're trying to move, **statistical power** and **sample size** that decide whether the test can even detect a real change, and **p-values / confidence intervals** that tell you how much to trust the result. An underpowered test isn't a small test — it's a misleading one.
>
> **How?** At this level you design tests, not just read them. You compute the sample size *before* launching from a target MDE, pick a primary metric plus guardrails, run an A/A test to trust your pipeline, and interpret results without committing the classic p-value and peeking sins.

## 1. Metrics: primary, guardrail, OEC

Not all metrics are equal. You need to be deliberate about which one decides the experiment.

| Metric type | Role | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| **Primary / decision metric** | The one number that decides ship/no-ship | Checkout conversion rate |
| **Guardrail metric** | Must *not* get worse, even if primary improves | p95 latency, error rate, refund rate, unsubscribe rate |
| **OEC** (Overall Evaluation Criterion) | The long-term goal the primary is a proxy for | Revenue per user, retained active days |
| **Debug / drill-down** | Help explain *why* the primary moved | Clicks per step, funnel drop-off |

The **OEC** is the concept from Kohavi et al.'s *Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments* (2020) worth internalizing: a *single* criterion that captures what the business actually wants, chosen so that improving it is genuinely good. The danger is optimizing a proxy that diverges from the goal — e.g. you boost "clicks" but the clicks are rage-clicks on a broken page. Guardrails exist precisely to catch the case where the primary went up but something important went down.

> Rule: a "win" is *primary up* **and** *every guardrail flat or better*. One broken guardrail can veto a ship.

## 2. The unit of assignment — and why it matters

You can randomize at different granularities:

- **Per request** — each HTTP call independently bucketed.
- **Per session** — one bucket per visit.
- **Per user** — one bucket forever (hash of user ID).

The choice is not cosmetic. Two rules:

1. **Randomize at the level your metric is measured.** If your metric is "users who convert," randomize per user. Mixing levels breaks the statistics, because the math assumes independent units and one user's many requests are not independent.
2. **Randomize coarsely enough that the user's experience is consistent.** If you bucket per request, a user sees the new button on one page and the old on the next. That's a broken UX *and* it pollutes the comparison — the user is partly in both arms.

Coarser units (user) give cleaner UX but need more total users for the same power, because the *effective sample size* is the number of independent units, not the number of events. Finer units (request) give huge sample counts but the units are correlated, which inflates your apparent confidence — a trap covered in [senior.md](./senior.md).

## 3. Sample size and power — the part everyone skips

Before launching, ask: *if there really is an effect of size X, will this test have enough data to see it?* That's **statistical power** — the probability of detecting a true effect. The convention is 80% power.

Three quantities are linked:

- **MDE (minimum detectable effect)** — the smallest change you care about. Set this by what's *worth shipping*, not what's convenient.
- **Baseline rate** — the control's current metric value.
- **Sample size per arm** — what you solve for.

A workable approximation for a conversion-rate test (two-sided, 5% significance, 80% power):

$$ n \approx \frac{16 \cdot p(1-p)}{(\text{MDE}_{abs})^2} \quad \text{per arm} $$

where `p` is the baseline rate and MDE is **absolute**. The constant 16 bundles the z-values for 95% confidence and 80% power.

### Worked example

Baseline conversion `p = 0.10`. You want to detect a **1% relative** lift, i.e. 0.10 → 0.101, so `MDE_abs = 0.001`.

$$ n \approx \frac{16 \times 0.10 \times 0.90}{(0.001)^2} = \frac{1.44}{0.000001} = 1{,}440{,}000 \text{ per arm} $$

That's **2.88 million users total** to detect a 1% relative lift on a 10% baseline. Now flip it: you want a **10% relative** lift (0.10 → 0.11, `MDE_abs = 0.01`):

$$ n \approx \frac{16 \times 0.09}{(0.01)^2} = 14{,}400 \text{ per arm} $$

A factor of 10 in MDE costs a factor of 100 in sample size, because `n` scales as `1/MDE²`. This is the single most useful intuition in experiment design: **small effects are extraordinarily expensive to detect.**

### Why underpowered tests are worse than no test

Suppose you have traffic for only 14,400 users per arm but you're chasing a 1% lift — you're running at ~10% power instead of 80%. Two things happen:

1. **You'll usually miss real effects** (90% false-negative rate) and wrongly conclude "no difference," killing good changes.
2. **The wins you *do* report are inflated.** With low power, the only way to clear significance is to catch a lucky, exaggerated sample — so significant results from underpowered tests systematically *overstate* the effect (the "winner's curse"). You ship, the lift evaporates in production, and you've burned trust.

A test you don't have the traffic to power should not be run as an A/B test. Pick a bigger MDE, get more traffic, or decide another way.

## 4. p-values and confidence intervals, stated honestly

A **p-value** is: *if there were truly no difference, how likely is data at least this extreme?* A small p (conventionally < 0.05) means "this would be surprising under no-effect, so we doubt no-effect."

What a p-value is **not**:

- ❌ The probability the null is true. (`p = 0.04` does **not** mean "96% chance B is better.")
- ❌ The probability your result will replicate.
- ❌ A measure of effect size. A tiny, useless effect can be highly significant with enough data.

A **confidence interval** is more useful for decisions. "Lift = +1.2%, 95% CI [+0.1%, +2.3%]" tells you the effect is probably positive *and* roughly how big. Always prefer reporting an interval over a bare p-value or a bare point estimate — the width tells you how much you actually know.

```
Treatment:  12.0% (n = 200,000)
Control:    11.4% (n = 200,000)
Lift:       +0.6 percentage points  (+5.3% relative)
95% CI:     [+0.2pp, +1.0pp]
p-value:    0.004
→ CI excludes 0, effect is positive; magnitude is modest but real.
```

## 5. Peeking and early stopping — quantified

Standard p-values assume you look **once**, at the pre-planned end. Each time you peek and would-stop-if-significant, you get another chance to cross p < 0.05 by luck. The false-positive rate compounds:

| Number of peeks | Actual chance of a false "significant" |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 (correct)     | ~5% |
| 5               | ~14% |
| 10              | ~19% |
| continuous      | →100% eventually |

If you watch a null test long enough and stop the moment it's "significant," you are **guaranteed** to eventually declare a false win. Two honest options:

1. **Fixed-horizon:** decide the sample size up front, look once at the end. Simple, what you should default to.
2. **Sequential testing:** use methods designed for repeated looks (e.g. always-valid p-values, group-sequential boundaries) that spend your error budget across peeks. More flexible, but you must use the right statistics — you can't just look at ordinary p-values repeatedly.

## 6. A/A tests — validate the pipeline first

Before trusting any A/B result, run an **A/A test**: split traffic into two groups that get the *identical* experience. There should be no difference. If your A/A test shows a "significant" difference, your experimentation system is broken — bad randomization, a logging bug, a population mismatch, or correlated units inflating confidence.

A/A tests also tell you your *natural variance*: how much the metric wiggles between two truly-identical groups. If A/A swings ±2% routinely, a 1% "lift" in an A/B is within noise. Run A/A tests periodically, not just once — they're the smoke detector for your whole platform.

## 7. Statistical vs practical significance

These are different questions:

- **Statistically significant:** the effect is probably not zero. (A p-value / CI question.)
- **Practically significant:** the effect is big enough to be worth shipping. (A judgment call about cost vs benefit.)

With millions of users, a 0.05% lift can be wildly statistically significant and completely not worth the engineering cost, added complexity, or guardrail risk. Conversely, a promising 3% lift with a CI of [−1%, +7%] is not significant — you can't ship on it, but it may be worth a bigger, better-powered rerun. Decide your **practical** threshold (the MDE) up front so significance alone never makes the call.

## Key takeaways

- Separate **primary**, **guardrail**, and **OEC** metrics; a win needs primary up *and* guardrails intact.
- **Unit of assignment** = the level your metric is measured at, coarse enough for consistent UX; mismatches break the stats.
- Compute **sample size from MDE before launch**; `n ∝ 1/MDE²`, so small effects are very expensive.
- **Underpowered tests are worse than none** — they miss real effects and inflate the ones they report.
- A p-value is *not* the probability the change is better; **report confidence intervals**.
- **Don't peek-and-stop** on ordinary p-values; the false-positive rate compounds. Run **A/A tests** to validate the pipeline.
- Distinguish **statistical** from **practical** significance.

## Use it today

1. Define population, control, treatment, duration, primary metric, and guardrails.
2. Check assignment and instrumentation before trusting the result.
3. Record the result, including an inconclusive one, and the next decision.

## Recall and apply

Try to answer these questions from memory:

1. Why is peeking at the dashboard and stopping when it's significant wrong?
2. What is statistical power and what's a sensible default?
3. Sample size scales how with the effect you want to detect?
4. Difference between statistical and practical significance?
