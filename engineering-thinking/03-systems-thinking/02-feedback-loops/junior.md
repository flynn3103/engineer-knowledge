# Feedback Loops — Junior

> **What?** A feedback loop is when a system's output is fed back as an input, so the system acts on itself. The current state influences the next state. Two flavors: **balancing** loops fight change and seek a target (a thermostat keeping a room at 21°C); **reinforcing** loops amplify change and compound (a retweet that gets seen, retweeted, seen more).
>
> **How?** As a junior engineer you learn to *spot* the loop: trace where an output comes back around to affect its own input. You name it (balancing or reinforcing), you find the **delay** between signal and correction, and you recognize the everyday loops you already touch — autoscaling, retries, CI feedback.

## 1. The one idea: output becomes input

Most things you build are linear in your head: request comes in → handler runs → response goes out. A feedback loop is when the *response changes the next request* — directly or through the world.

```mermaid

  A[Input] --> B[System]
  B --> C[Output]
  C -- feedback --> A
```

That little curved arrow back to the input is the whole topic. Everything else — oscillation, runaway, stability — comes from what that arrow does.

A concrete pair:

- **Autoscaler.** CPU goes up → autoscaler adds servers → load per server drops → CPU goes down. The output (high CPU) triggers an action that *reduces* the thing that triggered it. This loop **opposes** change.
- **Retry storm.** A service gets slow → clients retry → more requests hit the slow service → it gets slower → even more retries. The output (slowness) triggers an action that *increases* the thing that triggered it. This loop **amplifies** change.

Same shape, opposite sign. Learning to tell them apart is the first skill.

## 2. Balancing loops: the system corrects itself

A **balancing loop** (also called *negative feedback*) has a goal and pushes the system toward it. When the output drifts from the target, the loop generates a correction in the *opposite* direction.

The canonical example is a thermostat:

1. **Target:** 21°C.
2. **Measure:** room is 18°C.
3. **Compare:** 3°C too cold (the *error*).
4. **Act:** turn on heat.
5. Room warms → error shrinks → heat turns off.

Engineering is full of these:

| Loop | Target it seeks | Correction action |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Thermostat | Set temperature | Heat / cool |
| Autoscaler | Target CPU % | Add / remove instances |
| TCP congestion control | "Don't overflow the link" | Slow down sending when packets drop |
| Connection pool limit | Max N connections | Make callers wait when full |
| Load shedding | Stay under capacity | Drop low-priority requests |

The signature of a balancing loop: **it has a goal, and it resists being pushed away from it.** Push a stable system and it pushes back. That's why your servers don't melt the instant traffic spikes — a balancing loop kicks in.

## 3. Reinforcing loops: the system runs away

A **reinforcing loop** (also called *positive feedback*) feeds change back as *more* change. The output makes the next output bigger, which makes the next one bigger still. Small things compound into large things, fast.

Good versions:

- **Viral growth:** more users → more content/invites → more users.
- **Caching warmth:** popular item gets cached → faster → more popular → stays cached.

Dangerous versions (the ones that page you at 3am):

- **Retry storm:** slow service → retries → more load → slower → more retries.
- **Cache stampede:** a hot cache key expires → every request misses at once → all of them hit the database → database slows → requests pile up.
- **Thundering herd:** a service comes back online → every waiting client connects at the same instant → it falls over again.

> "Reinforcing" doesn't mean "good." It means "self-amplifying." A death spiral is a reinforcing loop you didn't want.

The signature: **no goal, just amplification.** A reinforcing loop has no target it's heading toward — it just makes the trend stronger until something outside the loop stops it (it hits a limit, or it crashes).

## 4. Balancing vs reinforcing at a glance

| | Balancing (negative) | Reinforcing (positive) |
|--|----------------------|------------------------|
| Effect on change | Opposes it | Amplifies it |
| Has a goal/target? | Yes | No |
| Long-run behavior | Settles toward equilibrium | Grows or collapses |
| Feels like | Stability, control | Momentum, runaway |
| Engineering examples | Autoscaler, TCP, load shedding | Retry storm, viral growth, stampede |
| When you want it | Keeping things steady | Growth — but watch the downside |

A trick that always works: ask **"if the output goes up, does the loop push it back down (balancing) or push it up more (reinforcing)?"**

## 5. Delay: why loops wobble instead of settling

Real loops don't act instantly. There's a **delay** between the signal and the correction. Delay is where instability comes from.

Picture a shower with a slow water heater. You turn the knob hot, nothing happens, you turn it hotter, suddenly it's scalding, you yank it cold, nothing, then it's freezing. You and the shower are *oscillating* — not because anyone is doing it wrong, but because the **delay** between your action and the result makes you over-correct.

Autoscalers do exactly this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[CPU high] --> B[Scale up]
  B -- "boot delay 3 min" --> C[New capacity]
  C --> D[CPU drops below target]
  D --> E[Scale down]
  E -- "by now traffic rose again" --> A
```

If new instances take 3 minutes to boot, the autoscaler is always reacting to *old* information. It adds too many, then removes too many — this is **autoscaler thrash**. The fix isn't a smarter target; it's shrinking the delay (faster boots, pre-warmed capacity) or slowing down reactions (cooldown periods) so the loop doesn't chase its own tail.

**Remember:** the longer the delay in a balancing loop, the more it tends to oscillate.

## 6. Short loops beat long loops (and that's why CI exists)

The *speed* of a feedback loop decides how fast a system can learn and correct. Short loops are better than long ones.

This is the whole reason continuous integration exists. Compare two ways of finding a bug:

- **Long loop:** write code → merge → release monthly → user reports a crash → you debug in production weeks later. The feedback took weeks; by then you've forgotten the change and built more on top of it.
- **Short loop:** write code → tests run in 90 seconds → red build → you fix it while it's still in your head.

Same bug, wildly different cost, purely because of loop length. As a junior, the practical version is: **make your own feedback loops short.** Run tests locally before pushing. Use a linter that flags problems as you type. Watch the CI result on your PR. Each of these shortens the gap between "I made a mistake" and "I found out."

This connects to [second-order effects](../03-second-order-effects/) — a slow feedback loop hides consequences, so problems compound before you ever see them.

## 7. Observability *is* feedback

You can't run a balancing loop without a signal. A thermostat with no thermometer can't keep the room warm. A system with no metrics can't correct itself — and neither can you.

That's the deep reason logs, metrics, and traces matter: **observability is the measurement step of every feedback loop in your system.** Latency dashboards, error-rate alerts, request traces — these are the "thermometer" that lets both the autoscaler *and the on-call engineer* close the loop.

A junior takeaway: when you add a feature, ask "how will I *see* whether it's working?" That signal is what makes the feedback loop possible at all.

## 8. Common loops you already touch

You don't need to build a control system to meet feedback loops. You already use these:

- **Tests → red/green:** a balancing loop on correctness. Error appears, you correct.
- **Code review → comments → revisions:** a balancing loop on quality. The *latency* of review matters — a review that takes 3 days is a slow loop, and your work drifts while you wait.
- **Alert → page → fix:** the operations loop. Slow alerts = slow correction.
- **Retries:** be careful — a retry is a tiny reinforcing loop hiding in your client. One retry is fine; everyone retrying a struggling service at once is a storm.

## 9. The junior toolkit

When you look at any system, run this checklist:

1. **Find the loop.** Where does an output come back to affect its input?
2. **Sign it.** Does it fight change (balancing) or amplify it (reinforcing)?
3. **Find the delay.** How long between the signal and the correction?
4. **Find the signal.** What measures the output — and is it fast and accurate?

Get good at this and you'll start predicting behavior before it happens: "this retry config plus a slow dependency is a storm waiting to happen," or "this autoscaler will thrash because boot time is too long."

## 10. Where to go next

- [Parts, whole, and emergence](../01-parts-whole-and-emergence/) — feedback loops are *how* the parts produce whole-system behavior.
- [Second-order effects](../03-second-order-effects/) — what loops do over time, beyond the first reaction.
- [Mental models of systems](../04-mental-models-of-systems/) — stocks, flows, and loops as a thinking toolkit.
- Section root: [Systems Thinking](../).

**One sentence to keep:** find the loop, sign it, time it, and shorten it — that's most of the value before you ever touch control theory.
