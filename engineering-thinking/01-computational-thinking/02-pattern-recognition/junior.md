# Pattern Recognition — Junior

> **What?** Pattern recognition is noticing that a new problem you're facing is *the same shape* as a problem you (or someone else) has already solved — so you can reuse the known solution instead of inventing one from scratch. It's the second pillar of computational thinking, sitting right after [decomposition](../01-decomposition/).
>
> **How?** When you hit a problem, before you start typing, ask: *"What does this remind me of? Have I seen this shape before?"* If a new task looks like "find the longest substring without repeats," and you've seen sliding-window problems, you say *"this is a sliding-window problem"* and pull the known template instead of writing a triple-nested loop.

## 1. What a "pattern" actually is

A pattern is a **recurring structure** that shows up across many different surface problems. The surface details change — names, data types, business domain — but the underlying *shape* repeats.

A concrete example. These three tasks look unrelated:

- Find the longest substring of a string with no repeated character.
- Find the maximum sum of any 5 consecutive numbers in an array.
- Count how many time-windows of 60 seconds contain more than 100 requests.

Surface: strings, numbers, log timestamps. Different domains entirely. But they're **the same problem**: you slide a window over a sequence and maintain something about what's inside the window. Once you see that, you don't re-derive the algorithm three times — you recognize *"sliding window"* and apply one template.

```
Surface problem  →  "what shape is this?"  →  known pattern  →  known solution
"longest substring" →  slide a window      →  sliding window →  two indices + a set
```

Recognizing the shape is the skill. The solution is already known — it's written down in a hundred places. Your job is the *mapping*.

## 2. Why this matters more than memorizing solutions

You cannot memorize a solution for every problem you'll ever face — there are infinitely many surface problems. But there is a **small, finite set of underlying patterns**. Maybe a few dozen algorithmic patterns cover the overwhelming majority of coding-interview and day-to-day data-shuffling problems.

So the leverage is enormous: learn ~30 patterns, and you can attack thousands of problems. Memorize 1000 solutions, and you can attack 1000 problems. Patterns are **compressed experience** — one pattern stands in for hundreds of specific cases.

This is exactly why senior engineers seem fast. They're usually not smarter on the spot; they've just seen the shape before. Where you see a brand-new, scary problem, they see *"oh, this is just a graph traversal with a visited-set."*

## 3. The most common algorithmic patterns (your starter library)

Build these into your reflexes first. The right-hand column is the *signal* — the clue in the problem statement that should trigger recognition.

| Pattern | Signal in the problem | Known solution sketch |
|---|---|---|
| **Two pointers** | sorted array, "find a pair", "in-place reverse/dedup" | one pointer from each end (or fast/slow) move toward each other |
| **Sliding window** | "contiguous subarray/substring", "longest/shortest window where…" | expand right, shrink left, track window state |
| **Hash map / set lookup** | "have I seen this before?", "count occurrences", "find duplicates" | store seen items for O(1) lookup |
| **BFS** | "shortest path in unweighted graph", "level by level", "nearest" | queue + visited set |
| **DFS** | "explore all paths", "connected components", "does a path exist" | recursion or stack + visited set |
| **Binary search** | sorted input, "find threshold", "minimize the maximum" | halve the search space each step |
| **Sorting first** | "find pairs/intervals", "group similar items" | sort, then a linear pass becomes easy |

You don't need to know *how* to implement all of these perfectly yet. You need to start **naming** them, so when you meet one in the wild, a bell rings.

## 4. A worked example: recognizing the shape

You're asked: *"Given a list of users and the friends each one has, find everyone reachable from user A."*

A junior who can't pattern-match starts inventing loops, gets tangled, and reinvents a buggy version of something well-known. A junior who *can* pattern-match thinks:

1. "Users connected to other users" → that's **nodes and edges** → it's a **graph**.
2. "Everyone reachable from a starting point" → that's **graph traversal**.
3. "Reachability, order doesn't matter" → **BFS or DFS** both work, pick one.

Now the solution writes itself, because the BFS template is standard:

```python
def reachable(start, friends):
    seen = {start}
    queue = [start]
    while queue:
        person = queue.pop(0)
        for friend in friends[person]:
            if friend not in seen:      # the "visited set" half of the pattern
                seen.add(friend)
                queue.append(friend)
    return seen
```

The hard part was never the code. It was the sentence: *"this is a graph traversal."* Everything after that is template.

## 5. How to start building your pattern library

Patterns don't arrive by magic. You install them deliberately.

- **Do katas, but reflect.** After solving a problem, don't just move on. Ask: *"What category was that? What was the signal that should have told me?"* Write the category next to it. The reflection is where the pattern gets filed in your memory — not the solving.
- **Read other people's solutions.** When you see an elegant solution, name its pattern. "Ah, they used two pointers here." You're stocking your shelf.
- **Group problems by pattern, not by topic.** Don't think "this is an Amazon problem." Think "this is a sliding-window problem." That's the label that transfers.

This is closely tied to how learning works — see [learning how to learn](../../10-metacognition-and-learning/01-learning-how-to-learn/). Patterns are *chunks*: bundles of knowledge your brain treats as a single unit, so they take up less working memory and free you to think about the hard parts.

## 6. The first trap to know about: forcing the pattern

Once you learn a pattern, there's a strong pull to see it *everywhere* — even where it doesn't fit. You learn recursion and suddenly every problem "should" be recursive. You learn a fancy data structure and want to use it on a five-element list.

The classic name for this is **the law of the instrument**, often quoted as: *"If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"* (Abraham Maslow, 1966). When you only know one pattern, every problem looks like that pattern.

The cure at your level is simple awareness plus a habit: after you *think* you've matched a pattern, do one sanity check — **does the problem actually have the signal?** A sliding-window pattern needs a *contiguous* window. If the problem allows skipping elements, it's not a sliding window, no matter how much you want it to be. Check the signal, not your hope.

## 7. Pattern recognition in debugging

Patterns aren't only for writing code — they're huge in fixing it. Bugs have **signatures**: a recurring symptom that maps to a class of cause.

| Symptom you see | Pattern it usually signals |
|---|---|
| `NullPointerException` / `undefined is not a function` | something you assumed existed didn't — a missing null check |
| Works alone, fails under load | a concurrency / shared-state problem |
| `index out of range` at the last element | an off-by-one in a loop boundary |
| Memory keeps climbing, then crash | a leak — something held that should've been freed |
| Fast in dev, slow in prod | the dataset is bigger; an O(n²) you didn't notice |

When you've seen a symptom enough times, you stop debugging from scratch. You see the stack trace and think *"oh, this signature — it's almost always X."* That instinct is pure pattern recognition, and it's why experienced engineers fix some bugs in seconds that would take you an hour.

## Key takeaways

- A **pattern** is a recurring *shape* across surface-different problems; recognizing it lets you reuse a known solution instead of inventing one.
- A small set of patterns covers a huge range of problems — patterns are **compressed experience**, far more leverage than memorizing solutions.
- Learn to **name** the common algorithmic patterns (two pointers, sliding window, BFS/DFS, binary search) and the *signal* that triggers each.
- The mapping — *"this is a graph traversal"* — is the hard, valuable part; the code is usually template.
- Beware the **law of the instrument**: don't force a familiar pattern onto a problem that lacks its signal. Check the signal, not your hope.
- Build your library deliberately through **reflection** on katas and reading others' code; the same skill powers fast **debugging** via symptom signatures.

**Next:** [abstraction and generalization](../03-abstraction-and-generalization/) — once you recognize a pattern, you can abstract it into something reusable. See also [decomposition](../01-decomposition/) and the [section overview](../).

## Recall and apply

**Practice loop:** Apply one idea to a current task. State the signal you saw, the choice you made, and what happened.

Use these prompts to check your understanding and choose one action to try in your next task.

Try to answer these questions from memory:

1. Classify five problems by underlying pattern
2. Map a messy ticket to a known class
3. Spot the false pattern (superstition vs. real pattern)
