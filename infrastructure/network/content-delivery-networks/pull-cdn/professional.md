# Pull CDN — Professional

<!-- level-focus -->
At professional level, focus on this question:

> How should teams adopt and operate **Pull CDN** with measurable outcomes and limited coordination?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.

## 1. The Pull CDN as an RFC-9111 Cache

A pull CDN edge is a *shared cache* in RFC 9111 terminology: one cache instance
serves many users, which changes the rules relative to a browser's *private* cache.
Two consequences matter throughout this document:

- **`s-maxage` and `private` apply.** `Cache-Control: s-maxage=N` sets the freshness
  lifetime for shared caches only and overrides `max-age` and `Expires` for them.
  `Cache-Control: private` forbids a shared cache from storing the response at all —
  which is why user-specific responses must never leak into a pull CDN without an
  explicit key that isolates them.
- **The edge stores a *response*, not a *representation truth*.** Everything it later
  decides — is this fresh, must I revalidate, may I serve it stale — is derived from
  the stored response's headers plus two clocks: when the edge *requested* the object
  and when it *received* it.

The lifecycle of one object through a pull edge:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant E as Edge (shared cache)
    participant O as Origin
    U->>E: 1. GET /img/hero.jpg
    E-->>U: 2. MISS — nothing stored
    E->>O: 3. GET /img/hero.jpg
    O-->>E: 4. 200 + Cache-Control: s-maxage=600, ETag "v7", Date, Age
    Note over E: 5. store body + headers;<br/>record request_time / response_time
    E-->>U: 6. 200 (from origin)
    U->>E: 7. GET /img/hero.jpg (later)
    Note over E: 8. compute current_age;<br/>compare to freshness_lifetime
    E-->>U: 9. 200 (HIT) with Age: <current_age>
```

Steps 5 and 8 are where the formal model lives: the edge must *record* two timestamps
at store time so that later it can compute `current_age` correctly, including time the
response already spent aging in upstream caches.

---

## 2. Freshness Lifetime — Where It Comes From

RFC 9111 §4.2.1 defines a strict precedence for computing an object's
`freshness_lifetime`. A shared cache (the CDN edge) uses the first of these that is
present:

| Rank | Source | Directive / Header | Applies to | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | `s-maxage` | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=N` | **shared caches only** | Overrides `max-age` and `Expires` for the CDN. Ignored by private (browser) caches. |
| 2 | `max-age` | `Cache-Control: max-age=N` | all caches | Overrides `Expires` when both are present. |
| 3 | `Expires` | `Expires: <HTTP-date>` | all caches | `freshness_lifetime = Expires − Date`. Legacy; a malformed or past date means already stale. |
| 4 | Heuristic | *(no explicit freshness)* | all caches | Cache **may** guess. Common: 10% of `(Date − Last-Modified)`, per §4.2.2. Only for cacheable status codes. |

Key precision points:

- `s-maxage`/`max-age`/`Expires` are all **relative to `Date`**, the origin's
  timestamp for when the response was generated — not to the edge's clock. This is why
  a correct implementation stores the origin `Date`.
- `no-store` forbids storage entirely; `no-cache` **permits storage but forbids reuse
  without successful revalidation** — its `freshness_lifetime` is effectively zero,
  every reuse is a conditional round-trip.
- `must-revalidate` changes what happens *after* expiry: a stale response may not be
  served; `stale-while-revalidate`/`stale-if-error` are then disallowed.
- Heuristic freshness is a trap for a pull CDN: an origin that omits `Cache-Control`
  can have its objects cached for hours by the edge's 10%-of-age guess. Professionals
  disable heuristic caching or require explicit directives at the edge.

`freshness_lifetime` alone does not decide reuse. Reuse requires
`current_age < freshness_lifetime` (§4.2). The subtle half is `current_age`.

---

## 3. Current Age — The Formula, Worked

RFC 9111 §4.2.3 defines age precisely so that an object that has *already* been aging
in an upstream cache is not treated as fresh at the edge. The edge records, at the
moment it stores the response:

- **`request_time`** — the edge's clock when it *sent* the request to origin.
- **`response_time`** — the edge's clock when it *received* the full response.

And reads from the response:

- **`age_value`** — the numeric `Age:` header the origin/upstream returned (0 if absent).
- **`date_value`** — the origin's `Date:` header, as a timestamp.

The formula (verbatim structure from §4.2.3):

```
apparent_age      = max(0, response_time − date_value)
response_delay    = response_time − request_time
corrected_age     = age_value + response_delay
corrected_initial_age = max(apparent_age, corrected_age)

resident_time     = now − response_time
current_age       = corrected_initial_age + resident_time
```

- `apparent_age` uses the origin's `Date` and defends against a missing/low `Age`.
- `corrected_age` adds back the network transit time (`response_delay`) to the reported
  upstream age, so we never *undercount* how old the body is.
- `corrected_initial_age` takes the max — the safe (older) of the two estimates.
- `resident_time` is how long the body has sat in *this* edge since storage.

### Worked number

Origin response headers and edge clocks for one object:

| Quantity | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `Date` (origin generated) | `12:00:00` |
| `Age` returned by upstream | `30` s |
| `request_time` (edge sent) | `12:00:04` |
| `response_time` (edge received) | `12:00:06` |
| `now` (later user hit) | `12:03:06` |
| `Cache-Control` | `s-maxage=600` |

Compute:

```
apparent_age          = max(0, 12:00:06 − 12:00:00) = 6 s
response_delay        = 12:00:06 − 12:00:04         = 2 s
corrected_age         = 30 + 2                       = 32 s
corrected_initial_age = max(6, 32)                   = 32 s
resident_time         = 12:03:06 − 12:00:06          = 180 s
current_age           = 32 + 180                      = 212 s
```

`freshness_lifetime = s-maxage = 600 s`. Since `current_age (212) < 600`, the object
is **fresh**: the edge serves the stored body directly, emitting `Age: 212`. Note the
30 s of upstream age is correctly carried forward — a naive `resident_time`-only
implementation would have reported `Age: 180` and served this object ~32 s past its
true expiry near the boundary. The 600 s budget will be exhausted at
`now = 12:00:06 + (600 − 32) = 12:10:14` of resident time.

## 4. The Freshness / Age Decision, as a State Machine

Every request against a stored object walks this decision. The distinction between
"fresh → serve", "stale but reusable → serve + async revalidate", and "must go to
origin" is the whole professional model in one diagram.

## 5. Revalidation: Conditional Requests, 304, and Validators

When an object is stale and cannot (or should not) be served stale, the edge does not
blindly re-download. It sends a **conditional request** (RFC 9110 §13) so the origin
can answer "still valid, keep your copy" in a few bytes:

- `If-None-Match: "<etag>"` — precondition using the stored `ETag`. The origin returns
  `304 Not Modified` if any listed entity-tag matches the current one.
- `If-Modified-Since: <HTTP-date>` — precondition using the stored `Last-Modified`.
  `ETag` is preferred; `If-Modified-Since` is the fallback when no `ETag` exists.

On **`304 Not Modified`** (RFC 9110 §15.4.5) the origin sends *no body*. The edge:

1. Updates the stored response's headers with those in the 304 (notably a fresh `Date`,
   `Cache-Control`, `Expires`) — this **resets `current_age` toward zero** because
   `resident_time` restarts and `date_value` advances.
2. Serves the previously stored body.

The bandwidth win is the entire point: a 304 is typically a few hundred bytes versus a
multi-megabyte asset. A pull CDN with `no-cache` (or expired) objects and stable
bodies spends most of its origin traffic on cheap 304s, not full transfers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant E as Edge
    participant O as Origin
    Note over E: object stale, ETag "v7" stored
    E->>O: GET /style.css<br/>If-None-Match: "v7"
    alt unchanged
        O-->>E: 304 Not Modified (no body) + new Date/Cache-Control
        Note over E: refresh headers → age resets;<br/>serve stored body
    else changed
        O-->>E: 200 + new body + ETag "v8"
        Note over E: replace stored response
    end
```

---

## 6. Strong vs Weak Validators

RFC 9110 §8.8 distinguishes **strong** and **weak** validators, and this distinction
governs *which* conditional requests are legal and what a match guarantees.

| Property | Strong validator | Weak validator |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Syntax | `ETag: "abc"` | `ETag: W/"abc"` (weak prefix) or `Last-Modified` |
| Guarantee | Byte-for-byte identical representation | *Semantically* equivalent (may differ byte-wise) |
| Changes on | Any change to the representation body | Only "significant" changes; equivalent renderings share a tag |
| Usable for | Range requests / `If-Range`, cache validation | Cache validation only — **not** `If-Range` |
| Typical source | Content hash, version id | Timestamp, "good enough" fingerprint |

Precise rules that trip people up:

- **Range/partial-content requires a strong validator.** `If-Range` with a weak
  validator is not allowed to yield a `206 Partial Content`; the origin must return the
  full `200`. This matters for a pull CDN doing range-based large-file delivery: weak
  ETags silently defeat efficient resume/segmented fetches.
- **`Last-Modified` is inherently weak** and has 1-second resolution. Two edits within
  the same second are indistinguishable — an origin that mutates sub-second must ship a
  strong `ETag` or the edge can serve a stale-but-"validated" body.
- **Comparison functions differ.** RFC 9110 defines *strong comparison* (both must be
  strong and equal) and *weak comparison* (equal ignoring the `W/`). `If-None-Match`
  uses weak comparison; `If-Range` uses strong comparison.

Operationally: emit content-addressed **strong ETags** (e.g. a hash of the body) at
origin. It costs a hash on origin but gives the CDN exact revalidation, correct range
support, and immunity to timestamp-resolution bugs.

## 7. stale-while-revalidate and stale-if-error (RFC 5861)

RFC 5861 adds two `Cache-Control` extensions that let a shared cache trade a bounded
amount of staleness for lower tail latency and higher availability — both are central
to a well-run pull CDN.

- **`stale-while-revalidate=N`** — for `N` seconds *after* an object becomes stale, the
  edge MAY serve the stale body **immediately** to the user while asynchronously
  revalidating in the background. The user pays zero revalidation latency; the next
  request gets the refreshed copy. This converts a synchronous origin round-trip on the
  request critical path into a background one.
- **`stale-if-error=N`** — for `N` seconds after staleness, if a revalidation attempt
  *fails* (origin 5xx, connection error, timeout), the edge MAY serve the stale body
  rather than propagate the error. This is a graceful-degradation lever: a brief origin
  outage becomes invisible to users for objects that were recently fresh.

Example header a resilient origin ships:

```
Cache-Control: s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=600, stale-if-error=86400
```

Interpretation: fresh for 60 s; for the next 600 s serve-stale-then-refresh
(no user-facing origin latency at the edge); and for a full day, if the origin is
*down*, keep serving the last good copy rather than erroring. `must-revalidate` in the
same response would **disable** both behaviors — the two are mutually exclusive by
intent.

The availability math is why this matters: with `stale-if-error=86400`, an origin
outage of minutes affects only the *newly-published* objects and users hitting a
genuine miss; the long tail of already-cached, recently-fresh objects rides straight
through the outage.

---

## 8. Vary and Secondary Cache Keys

The primary cache key is the request method + effective URI. But a single URL can map
to *multiple* stored representations — gzip vs brotli, English vs French — selected by
request headers. `Vary` (RFC 9110 §12.5.5, RFC 9111 §4.1) tells the cache which request
headers form the **secondary cache key**.

```
Vary: Accept-Encoding
```

means: two requests for the same URL match a stored response only if their
`Accept-Encoding` values match under the cache's normalization. Consequences a
professional must control:

- **Cardinality explosion.** `Vary: User-Agent` is nearly fatal — the UA string is
  effectively unique per client, so every request is a miss and hit ratio collapses.
  Vary only on headers with a *small, normalized* value space (`Accept-Encoding`
  reduced to `gzip`/`br`/identity; `Accept-Language` reduced to a primary tag).
- **`Vary: *`** means the response is *uncacheable by key* — never reusable. Treat as
  effectively no-store for the CDN.
- **Normalization belongs at the edge.** A good pull CDN canonicalizes the varying
  header (sort/dedupe `Accept-Encoding`, collapse `Accept-Language` to `en`/`fr`)
  before forming the secondary key, or the raw header variety fragments the cache.
- **Cookies.** Varying on `Cookie` is almost always wrong for a shared cache — it makes
  responses per-user. Strip cookies at the edge for cacheable static paths instead.

Rule of thumb: the number of stored variants per URL is the product of the distinct
normalized values across all `Vary` headers. Keep that product tiny (2–6), or the cache
degenerates toward miss-per-request.

## 9. A Hit-Ratio Model: Working Set, Che's Approximation, Origin QPS

Hit ratio is not a vibe; it is predictable from the request popularity distribution and
the cache size. Two complementary models:

### TTL-driven origin QPS (freshness-limited)

For an object requested at rate `λ` (req/s) that is cacheable with `freshness_lifetime
= T` seconds, an LRU/TTL cache under steady traffic sends at most **one origin fetch per
`T` seconds** for that object (the first request after each expiry). So:

```
origin_QPS ≈ Σ over objects  (1 / T)   [freshness-limited term]
           = (number of distinct cacheable objects) / T   (uniform T)
```

If the CDN fronts `D = 1,000,000` distinct hot objects each with `T = 60 s`, the
*freshness* floor on origin traffic is `D / T = 1,000,000 / 60 ≈ 16,700` origin
fetches/s — independent of user QPS. This is the term you reduce by raising `T` (or
using revalidation so those fetches are cheap 304s).

### Che's approximation (capacity-limited, LRU)

When the cache **cannot hold the whole working set**, misses also come from eviction.
Che's approximation models an LRU cache of `C` objects via a **characteristic time**
`t_C` (the "cache eviction time"): an object survives in cache iff it is re-requested
within `t_C`. For object *i* with request rate `λ_i` (Poisson/IRM assumption), its hit
probability is:

```
h_i = 1 − e^(−λ_i · t_C)
```

and `t_C` is the unique solution of the capacity constraint:

```
Σ_i (1 − e^(−λ_i · t_C)) = C
```

The **overall hit ratio** is the request-weighted average:

```
H = ( Σ_i λ_i · h_i ) / ( Σ_i λ_i )
```

Intuition: popular objects (large `λ_i`) have `h_i → 1`; cold objects (small `λ_i`)
have `h_i → 0`. Under a Zipf popularity law — realistic for web/CDN traffic — a small
`C` covering the head already captures most requests, which is why real CDN hit ratios
sit at 85–98% with caches far smaller than the full catalog.

### Which term dominates?

Total origin traffic ≈ **capacity misses (Che)** + **freshness expirations (TTL)**. For
a cache large enough to hold the hot set, the freshness term dominates and the fix is
longer TTL + cheap revalidation. For an undersized edge, the capacity term dominates and
the fix is more edge storage or better admission (don't cache one-hit-wonders).

---

## 10. Putting It Together — A Worked Capacity Slice

Assume a pull CDN edge in front of an image origin:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| User request rate at the edge | `λ_total = 50,000` req/s |
| Distinct hot objects | `D = 200,000` |
| Popularity | Zipf(α≈0.9); top 20k objects ≈ 80% of requests |
| Edge cache capacity | `C = 40,000` objects |
| Freshness lifetime | `T = 300 s`, with `stale-while-revalidate=300` |
| Revalidation outcome | mostly `304` (bodies stable) |

**Capacity-limited hit ratio (Che, order-of-magnitude):** `C = 40,000` comfortably
covers the ~20k-object head that drives 80% of traffic plus a long secondary band, so
`H ≈ 0.92`. Miss (capacity) traffic to origin ≈ `(1 − 0.92) × 50,000 = 4,000` req/s
worst case — but most of those are *warm re-fetches*, not truly cold.

**Freshness floor on true origin fetches:** the *distinct* cacheable objects that must
be refreshed on TTL expiry drive `≈ D_hot / T`. For the ~40k resident objects,
`40,000 / 300 ≈ 133` refreshes/s — and with `stale-while-revalidate` these happen
**off** the user critical path, and as `304`s they cost a few hundred bytes each, not a
full image.

**Net origin load:** dominated by the ~4,000 req/s of capacity misses (real body
transfers for the cold tail) plus ~133 req/s of cheap background 304 revalidations. The
levers are now explicit and quantified: increase `C` to shrink the 4,000 (capacity),
increase `T` to shrink the 133 (freshness), and keep strong `ETag`s so the 133 stay
cheap 304s. `stale-if-error` then converts an origin outage into invisible stale-serving
for the resident 40k objects — a fully specified, formally reasoned pull-CDN edge.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Pull CDN** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Pull CDN?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
