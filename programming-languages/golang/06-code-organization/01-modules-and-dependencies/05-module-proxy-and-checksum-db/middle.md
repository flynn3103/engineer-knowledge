# Module Proxy & Checksum Database — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Module Proxy & Checksum Database** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
## The GOPROXY Protocol (HTTP Endpoints)

A module proxy is just an HTTP (or HTTPS) server that answers a fixed set of GET requests. There is no authentication scheme baked into the protocol, no POST, no websockets — only GETs that return files. This simplicity is deliberate: you can serve a proxy from a static file tree, an S3 bucket, or `python3 -m http.server`.

For a module with path `M` and version `V`, the endpoints are:

| Endpoint | Returns | Content-Type |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `$base/<M>/@v/list` | Newline-separated list of known *tagged* versions (no pseudo-versions). | `text/plain` |
| `$base/<M>/@v/<V>.info` | JSON metadata: `{"Version": "...", "Time": "..."}`. | `application/json` |
| `$base/<M>/@v/<V>.mod` | The raw `go.mod` file for version `V`. | `text/plain` |
| `$base/<M>/@v/<V>.zip` | The module source, zipped, with a canonical layout. | `application/zip` |
| `$base/<M>/@latest` | JSON metadata for the version Go considers "latest" (used when no version is given). | `application/json` |

A worked example with `curl` against the public proxy:

```bash
base=https://proxy.golang.org

curl "$base/github.com/google/uuid/@v/list"
# v1.0.0
# v1.1.0
# ...
# v1.6.0

curl "$base/github.com/google/uuid/@v/v1.6.0.info"
# {"Version":"v1.6.0","Time":"2024-01-12T20:25:00Z"}

curl "$base/github.com/google/uuid/@v/v1.6.0.mod"
# module github.com/google/uuid
# ...

curl -sO "$base/github.com/google/uuid/@v/v1.6.0.zip"

curl "$base/github.com/google/uuid/@latest"
# {"Version":"v1.6.0","Time":"2024-01-12T20:25:00Z"}
```

### Case encoding

Module paths can contain uppercase letters, but many filesystems are case-insensitive. The proxy protocol therefore **escapes uppercase letters** with a `!` prefix and a lowercase letter. `github.com/Masterminds/semver` becomes `github.com/!masterminds/semver` in proxy URLs and in the on-disk cache. You will see this encoding when debugging real fetches.

```bash
curl "https://proxy.golang.org/github.com/!masterminds/semver/v3/@v/list"
```

### `.info` and pseudo-versions

The `.info` endpoint also answers for *pseudo-versions* — synthesized versions for untagged commits, like `v0.0.0-20240101000000-abcdef123456`. The `list` endpoint, however, returns only proper tagged releases; pseudo-versions are resolved on demand through `.info`.

## How `go` Resolves a Module Through a Proxy

When the toolchain needs `M@V`, the sequence is:

1. **Determine the proxy list** from `GOPROXY` (split on `,` and `|`).
2. **For the first proxy**, request the metadata: usually `.info` (and `list` if it needs to resolve a query like `@latest` or `@>=v1.2.0`).
3. **Fetch the `.mod`** for the resolved version (needed for the module graph even if the zip is not yet required).
4. **Fetch the `.zip`** when source is actually needed for a build.
5. **Verify** the downloaded bytes against `go.sum` and, on first use, against the checksum database.
6. **Store** the verified module in the cache.

If a proxy returns **404 Not Found** or **410 Gone**, Go treats that as "this proxy does not have it" and *falls forward* to the next entry in the list (the comma separator controls this — see below). Any other error (500, network timeout) is fatal for that proxy and, depending on the separator, may or may not fall forward.

The `.mod`-before-`.zip` ordering matters: Go builds the *module graph* from `.mod` files alone, which is much cheaper than downloading every zip. It only downloads zips for packages it actually compiles.

---

## GOPROXY Configuration: Comma vs Pipe, `direct`, `off`

`GOPROXY` is a list of entries separated by either `,` or `|`. The separator changes the fall-forward semantics:

| Separator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `,` (comma) | Fall forward to the next entry **only on 404 or 410** (module genuinely not found). Any other error stops the whole resolution. |
| `\|` (pipe) | Fall forward to the next entry **on any error** (including 500, timeout, TLS failure). More permissive. |

Two special keywords may appear in the list:

- **`direct`** — not a URL but an instruction: "bypass proxies and fetch from the source repository's version-control system (Git, Mercurial, etc.) directly." Usually the last entry.
- **`off`** — "stop here; do not download anything. Fail if the module is not already available." Anything after `off` is unreachable.

### Examples

```bash
# The default: public proxy, then fall back to direct VCS on "not found"
GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.org,direct

# Corporate proxy first, then public, then direct
GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct

# Only the corporate proxy; if it fails for ANY reason, give up
GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example.com

# Permissive: try corporate, on any failure try public, then direct
GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example.com|https://proxy.golang.org|direct

# Fully offline: never touch the network
GOPROXY=off
```

The comma-vs-pipe distinction is subtle but important: with a comma, a transient 500 from your corporate proxy aborts the build (you find out it is broken); with a pipe, the same 500 silently falls through to the public proxy (your build succeeds but bypasses your corporate controls). Choose deliberately.

## The Module Cache (`$GOMODCACHE`)

Downloaded modules are stored in the module cache, by default at `$GOPATH/pkg/mod`, overridable via `GOMODCACHE`:

```bash
go env GOMODCACHE
# /Users/you/go/pkg/mod
```

### Layout

```
$GOMODCACHE/
├── cache/
│   ├── download/                         ← raw proxy responses, mirrors the protocol
│   │   └── github.com/google/uuid/@v/
│   │       ├── list
│   │       ├── v1.6.0.info
│   │       ├── v1.6.0.mod
│   │       ├── v1.6.0.zip
│   │       ├── v1.6.0.ziphash            ← the h1: hash of the zip
│   │       └── v1.6.0.lock
│   └── lock
└── github.com/google/uuid@v1.6.0/        ← the EXTRACTED, read-only source tree
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── uuid.go
    └── ...
```

Two parts matter:

- **`cache/download/`** mirrors the proxy protocol exactly. `go` can act as a proxy *serving from this directory* — that is the basis of `GOPROXY=file:///...` and `GOFLAGS=-modcacherw`.
- **`<module>@<version>/`** is the extracted source, made **read-only** so accidental edits are caught.

### Important properties

- The cache is **shared across every project and user** on the machine. Two repos using `uuid@v1.6.0` download it once.
- Files are read-only by default. Set `GOFLAGS=-modcacherw` (or `go env -w GOFLAGS=-modcacherw`) if a tool needs writable cache files (rarely a good idea).
- Wipe it with `go clean -modcache`. This forces a full re-download next build. Reserve for corruption or disk pressure.
- `cache/download/<M>/@v/<V>.ziphash` stores the `h1:` hash so Go can verify cache integrity without re-hashing the whole zip every time.

### Serving the cache as a proxy

Because `cache/download/` is exactly the proxy protocol on disk, you can point another machine at it:

```bash
GOPROXY="file://$(go env GOMODCACHE)/cache/download" go build ./...
```

This is the simplest possible "private proxy" — a directory served over `file://`.

---

## The Checksum Database and `go.sum`

`go.sum` is the per-module record of expected hashes. The checksum database (`sum.golang.org`) is the global record that bootstraps and cross-checks it.

### How a `go.sum` entry is created

When Go fetches a version it does not yet have a `go.sum` entry for:

1. It downloads the `.zip` and `.mod` from the proxy.
2. It computes the `h1:` hash of each.
3. **If `GOSUMDB` is set and the module is not private**, it asks the checksum database for the official hash and verifies the download matches.
4. It writes the verified hashes into `go.sum`.

After that, the entry in `go.sum` is the authority. On every subsequent build, Go re-hashes the cached bytes and compares to `go.sum` — the sumdb is not consulted again for that version.

### What `go.sum` protects against

- **Cache or download corruption** — bit-flips, truncated files.
- **A proxy serving different bytes** than what was originally recorded.
- **An upstream author silently changing a published version** (moving a Git tag).
- **A man-in-the-middle** swapping module contents.

It does **not** protect against:
- Malicious-but-consistent code (the hash is valid; the code is still hostile).
- Choosing the wrong version in the first place.

### The lifecycle

```
go get M@V  ──►  download .zip/.mod
                       │
                       ├─► sumdb verify (first time only) ──► go.sum entry written
                       │
go build    ──►  read cache, re-hash, compare to go.sum ──► match? build : SECURITY ERROR
```

---

## The `h1:` Hash: What It Actually Hashes

The `h1:` prefix names the *hashing scheme*, version 1. It is **not** a plain SHA-256 of the zip file. Computing it correctly is what makes the hash stable across different zip implementations.

The algorithm (paraphrased):

1. For the module zip, list every file path inside it with its SHA-256.
2. Produce lines of the form `<sha256-hex>  <filepath>\n`, sorted by file path.
3. Take the SHA-256 of that *entire listing*.
4. Base64-encode it and prefix with `h1:`.

This means the `h1:` hash is a **hash of a sorted manifest of per-file hashes**, not a hash of the raw zip bytes. The benefit: two zips with identical file contents but different compression or ordering produce the *same* `h1:` hash. Integrity is about content, not packaging.

For the `/go.mod` line, the scheme hashes the single `go.mod` file the same way (a one-entry manifest).

So each module version has two `go.sum` lines:

```
github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0 h1:NIvaJDMOsjHA8n1jAhLSgzrAzy1Hgr+hNrb57e+94F0=
github.com/google/uuid v1.6.0/go.mod h1:TIyPZe4MgqvfeYDBFedMoGGpEw/LqOeaOT+nhxU+yHo=
```

- The first hashes the *zip's file manifest* (the whole source tree).
- The second hashes only the *`go.mod`* (used during module-graph construction, before any zip is fetched).

The `/go.mod` hash exists separately because Go reads `go.mod` files to build the dependency graph long before it downloads source. It needs to verify those `go.mod` files independently.

---

## GOPRIVATE, GONOSUMDB, GONOPROXY, GOINSECURE

These four variables control *which modules bypass the public infrastructure* and *how*. They take comma-separated glob patterns matched against module path prefixes.

| Variable | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `GONOPROXY` | Modules matching these patterns are fetched **directly from VCS**, never through a proxy. |
| `GONOSUMDB` | Modules matching these patterns are **not** checked against the checksum database. (`go.sum`, if present, is still enforced.) |
| `GOPRIVATE` | A convenience: sets the **default** for both `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB`. The single setting most people use. |
| `GOINSECURE` | Modules matching these patterns may be fetched over **plain HTTP** and skip TLS certificate validation. Use only for trusted internal hosts. |

### The key relationship

`GOPRIVATE` does not do anything itself — it *provides the default value* for `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB`. So:

```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE='github.com/yourco/*,git.internal.example.com/*'
```

is equivalent (in effect) to setting both `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` to that pattern. If you set `GONOPROXY` or `GONOSUMDB` explicitly, they override the `GOPRIVATE`-derived default for their respective concern.

### Why you need it

Private modules are invisible to the public proxy and sumdb. Without `GOPRIVATE`:

- Go asks `proxy.golang.org` for your internal module → 404/410, or it leaks the path.
- Go asks `sum.golang.org` for a hash → fails, because the sumdb has never seen your private code.

`GOPRIVATE` tells Go: "for these paths, go straight to the VCS and do not consult the public checksum database."

### Subtle but important

- `GONOSUMDB` disables the *checksum database* lookup, **not** `go.sum` verification. Your `go.sum` is still enforced for private modules. You are still protected against your *own* cache changing — you are only skipping the *global* log (which could not help anyway).
- `GOINSECURE` is the most dangerous of the four. It permits unencrypted, unauthenticated fetches. Reserve it for internal hosts you fully control.
- `GONOSUMCHECK` (note: **not** `GONOSUMDB`) is a deprecated, removed variable — see below.

---

## GONOSUMCHECK (Deprecated) and Why It's Gone

`GONOSUMCHECK` was an early, blunt environment variable that disabled **all** checksum verification — both the sumdb lookup *and* `go.sum` enforcement. It existed briefly during the module-system rollout (around Go 1.12–1.13) and was **removed** before the modern system stabilized.

It was replaced by a more precise set:

- `GONOSUMDB` (now usually set via `GOPRIVATE`) — skip only the *checksum database*, keep `go.sum`.
- `GOFLAGS=-insecure` / `GOINSECURE` — relax transport security narrowly.
- `GONOSUMDB`/`GOPRIVATE` for path-scoped exclusions instead of a global off-switch.

The lesson: do not reach for an old `GONOSUMCHECK` tip you find in a stale blog post. It does nothing on modern Go. If you genuinely need to disable the global checksum database, set `GOSUMDB=off` (machine-wide, blunt) or, far better, scope it with `GOPRIVATE`/`GONOSUMDB`.

### Quick disambiguation

| Name | Status | What it does |
|------|--------|--------------|
| `GONOSUMCHECK` | **Removed** | (historical) disabled all checksum checks |
| `GONOSUMDB` | Active | skip the *checksum database* for matching paths; `go.sum` still enforced |
| `GOSUMDB=off` | Active | disable the checksum database entirely, machine-wide |
| `GONOPROXY` | Active | fetch matching paths directly from VCS, skip the proxy |
| `GOPRIVATE` | Active | sets defaults for both `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` |
| `GOINSECURE` | Active | allow HTTP / skip cert checks for matching paths |

## Verifying and Repairing: `go mod verify`, `go mod download`

Two commands cover most cache and integrity operations.

### `go mod download`

Populates the cache with everything `go.mod` requires (or a specific module), without building. Use it to warm caches in CI and before offline work:

```bash
go mod download              # all required modules
go mod download github.com/google/uuid
go mod download -x           # show the HTTP requests
go mod download -json        # machine-readable output (paths, hashes, errors)
```

`-json` is especially useful in tooling: it emits the cache path, the zip path, the `Sum`, and any `Error` per module.

### `go mod verify`

Re-checks that the modules **in the cache** still match their recorded `go.sum` hashes:

```bash
go mod verify
# all modules verified
```

If a cached module was tampered with or corrupted, `go mod verify` reports it. Note: it verifies the *cache against `go.sum`*; it is not the same as the on-the-fly verification that happens during every build.

### Repair recipe

```bash
go clean -modcache     # drop the (possibly corrupt) cache
go mod download        # re-fetch and re-verify everything
go mod verify          # confirm clean
```

---

## Common Proxy/Sumdb Errors and Their Real Causes

A field guide.

### `checksum mismatch ... SECURITY ERROR`

```
verifying github.com/foo/bar@v1.2.0: checksum mismatch
	downloaded: h1:AAA...
	go.sum:     h1:BBB...
```

The downloaded bytes do not match `go.sum`. Causes, in order of likelihood:
1. Corrupted cache → `go clean -modcache && go mod download`.
2. Upstream author moved a tag (changed published bytes) → investigate; update or pin a clean version.
3. A malicious or misconfigured proxy serving different bytes → take seriously; never just delete `go.sum`.

### `missing go.sum entry for ...`

You imported a package whose hash is not recorded. Fix: `go mod tidy` or `go mod download <module>`.

### `... 404 Not Found` / `... 410 Gone`

The proxy cannot resolve the module/version. Causes: typo, unpublished version, or a private module that needs `GOPRIVATE`.

### `verifying ...: checksum database disabled by GOSUMDB=off`

Informational — you (or your environment) turned the sumdb off. New modules are recorded in `go.sum` without a global cross-check (TOFU with weaker guarantees).

### `module declares its path as X but was required as Y`

Not a proxy error per se, but surfaces during fetch. The `go.mod` inside the module declares a different module path than you imported. Cause: a fork without a path update, or a vanity-import mismatch. Fix the import path or use a `replace`.

### `dial tcp ... connect: connection refused` / TLS errors

Network/firewall problem reaching the proxy. Fix: confirm the proxy URL, check corporate proxy/VPN, or fall back to a reachable proxy.

---

## Configuring for Private and Corporate Environments

A realistic enterprise setup combines several settings.

### Private modules on an internal Git host

```bash
go env -w GOPRIVATE='git.corp.example.com/*,github.com/yourco/*'
```

This makes Go fetch those paths directly from VCS and skip the public sumdb. You still need *credentials* — typically via `~/.netrc` (HTTPS) or SSH config, plus a `GONOSUMCHECK`-free `.gitconfig` rewrite:

```
# ~/.gitconfig
[url "git@git.corp.example.com:"]
    insteadOf = https://git.corp.example.com/
```

### Routing everything through a corporate proxy

```bash
go env -w GOPROXY='https://goproxy.corp.example.com'
go env -w GOSUMDB='off'                       # if the corp proxy serves its own checks
go env -w GONOSUMDB='*'                        # or scope it
```

Many corporate proxies (Athens, Artifactory) mirror both public and private modules and can serve a sumdb of their own. In that case you point `GOPROXY` at the mirror and let it handle upstream.

### A common, balanced configuration

```bash
GOPROXY=https://goproxy.corp.example.com,https://proxy.golang.org,direct
GOPRIVATE=github.com/yourco/*
GOSUMDB=sum.golang.org
```

Read as: try the corporate mirror first, then the public proxy, then direct; treat `yourco` paths as private (skip proxy + public sumdb); keep the public checksum database for everything public.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Leave `GOPROXY`/`GOSUMDB` at defaults** unless you have a corporate mirror or private modules.
2. **Set `GOPRIVATE` for all internal paths** — one setting, applied globally with `go env -w`.
3. **Prefer comma (`,`) over pipe (`|`) in `GOPROXY`** so transient proxy failures surface instead of silently falling through corporate controls.
4. **Commit `go.sum`** and never hand-edit it.
5. **Use `go mod download -json` in tooling** for structured cache/hash data.
6. **Cache `$GOMODCACHE` in CI** to avoid re-downloading every job.
7. **Reserve `GOINSECURE` for trusted internal hosts**; never use it for public modules.
8. **Treat `checksum mismatch` as a security event**, not an annoyance.
9. **Understand the comma/pipe and direct/off keywords** before composing a proxy chain.

---

## Pitfalls You Will Meet in Real Projects

### Pitfall 1 — Pipe separator hiding a broken corporate proxy

`GOPROXY=https://corp|https://proxy.golang.org` silently falls through to the public proxy when the corporate one errors. Builds "work," but your dependency governance is bypassed. Use a comma if the corporate proxy is meant to be authoritative.

### Pitfall 2 — `GOPRIVATE` set but credentials missing

`GOPRIVATE` tells Go to fetch from VCS directly, but it does not provide auth. The fetch fails with a Git authentication error. Fix `~/.netrc`, SSH keys, or `.gitconfig` URL rewrites.

### Pitfall 3 — `GONOSUMDB` confused with `GONOSUMCHECK`

`GONOSUMCHECK` is removed and does nothing. Use `GONOSUMDB` (or `GOPRIVATE`) for path-scoped exclusions, or `GOSUMDB=off` for the blunt machine-wide switch.

### Pitfall 4 — Case-encoding surprises

Debugging `github.com/Masterminds/...` fetches and seeing `!masterminds` in URLs and cache paths is correct, not a bug. Uppercase letters are `!`-escaped.

### Pitfall 5 — Wiping the cache to "fix" an unrelated issue

`go clean -modcache` forces a full re-download. It fixes corruption but is otherwise a slow no-op. Do not make it a habit.

### Pitfall 6 — Assuming `GOSUMDB=off` disables `go.sum`

It does not. `GOSUMDB=off` only skips the *global* checksum database. Your local `go.sum` is still enforced on every build. To skip `go.sum` too you would need `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod` plus the absence of an entry — and you almost never want that.

### Pitfall 7 — Forgetting that `list` omits pseudo-versions

`/@v/list` returns only tagged releases. If you are looking for a commit-based pseudo-version, query `.info` with the commit or use `go list -m M@<commit>`.

### Pitfall 8 — Trusting a stale blog's `GONOSUMCHECK` advice

Old tutorials suggest `GONOSUMCHECK=1` to bypass checksum errors. It is removed. Worse, the underlying error is usually real. Do not chase removed env vars.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Module Proxy & Checksum Database** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Module Proxy & Checksum Database?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
