# Module Graph Pruning

[← Back](../README.md)

We explore **module graph pruning**, the Go 1.17 change that shrinks the module graph a build must load. For main modules at `go 1.17` or later, the toolchain loads the full transitive `go.mod` graph only of *directly relevant* dependencies and prunes the rest — making `go` commands faster, more predictable, and offline-friendlier, at the cost of recording more `// indirect` requirements in `go.mod`.

## Sub-pages

- [junior.md](junior.md) — What pruning is, why `go.mod` grew, the two `require` blocks, first commands
- [middle.md](middle.md) — Pruned vs full graph mechanics, `go mod graph`, `tidy -go`, `-compat`, lazy loading
- [senior.md](senior.md) — Migration strategy, deepening the graph, MVS interaction, monorepo and CI implications
- [professional.md](professional.md) — Toolchain internals, the pruning algorithm, `modules.txt`/`go.sum` interplay, edge cases
- [specification.md](specification.md) — Formal reference: pruning rules, the `go` directive's role, version-by-version behaviour
- [interview.md](interview.md) — Interview questions and answers from junior to staff
- [tasks.md](tasks.md) — Hands-on exercises (easy → hard)
- [find-bug.md](find-bug.md) — Bug-finding exercises with pruning, indirect-require, and `-compat` scenarios
