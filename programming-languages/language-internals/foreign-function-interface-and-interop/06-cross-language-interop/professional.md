## Core Concepts

### The Production Decision Framework

Every interop mechanism sits on one axis from *fastest and most coupled* to *slowest and most decoupled*:

```text
  In-process FFI    Polyglot VM        Wasm component       RPC / IPC (IDL)
  ──────────────    ──────────────     ──────────────       ──────────────
  ns-scale call     ns-scale call      µs-scale call        ms-scale call
  shared memory     shared heap+GC     sandboxed memory     separate processes
  one crash domain  one crash domain   isolated*            isolated
  ABI fragility     runtime lock-in    stable WIT ABI       schema + network
  most dangerous    same-runtime only  portable+secure      most decoupled
```

(*A Wasm component traps rather than corrupting the host; the host survives the guest's failure.)

Walk these questions in order; the first "yes" usually wins:

1. **Do the languages already share a runtime** (all JVM, all .NET)? Use shared-runtime interop. There is no boundary to design — it is just method calls. Reaching for FFI or RPC here is self-inflicted complexity.
2. **Is this a hard fault-isolation, independent-deploy, or cross-machine requirement?** Use RPC/IPC. Accept the latency; you are buying a crash boundary and independent lifecycles, which no in-process mechanism gives you.
3. **Do you need to run untrusted or third-party code in-process at near-native speed?** Use Wasm components with WASI capabilities. This is the only point on the axis that gives speed *and* a sandbox.
4. **Do you need maximum throughput against trusted native code, and can you own the maintenance of a binding layer?** Use FFI — flatten to a C ABI. This is the fastest and the most dangerous; pick it with eyes open.

The trap at every level below Principal is **defaulting to the familiar mechanism.** A team that ships microservices reaches for gRPC even for an in-process plugin; a team that lives in C++ reaches for FFI even when the boundary is a security perimeter. The framework exists to interrupt the default.

### In-Process FFI: Fastest, Most Dangerous

FFI is the fastest interop there is — a foreign call is a few instructions over a native call. It is also the most dangerous, for reasons that compound:

- **Shared crash domain.** A null deref, a buffer overrun, or an `abort()` in the foreign code takes down the whole process. Your Python web server does not "catch an exception" when the C library segfaults; it dies.
- **Shared memory, no boundary.** Foreign code can scribble anywhere in your address space. A buffer overflow in a parsing library is a remote code execution path into your host.
- **ABI fragility.** The boundary is a binary contract — struct layout, calling convention, name mangling, type sizes. A compiler upgrade, a flag change, or a 32-vs-64-bit mismatch corrupts data silently.
- **Lifetime and ownership ambiguity.** Who frees this pointer? With which allocator? When? Every FFI boundary needs an explicit ownership contract, and most production FFI bugs are violations of an implicit one.
- **Threading and reentrancy.** The foreign library's threading assumptions (does it have global state? is it reentrant? does it expect a specific thread?) are now your problem.

The professional posture: use FFI when you genuinely need the throughput against *trusted* native code, keep the boundary surface tiny, flatten it to a clean C ABI, and write down the ownership and threading contract as if a junior will violate it — because one will.

### Flattening C++ Through a `extern "C"` Shim

You cannot FFI directly into a C++ class. C++ has name mangling, an unstable ABI across compilers, exceptions that cannot cross a C boundary, templates that do not exist at link time, and an object model (vtables, multiple inheritance) that no other language understands. The universal answer is the **`extern "C"` shim**: a thin C-linkage layer that wraps the C++ API in flat functions operating on **opaque pointers**.

The pattern has four rules:

1. **Opaque handle in, opaque handle out.** The C side sees `typedef struct Parser Parser;` and `Parser*`; it never sees the C++ layout. Construction and destruction go through `parser_create` / `parser_destroy`.
2. **No C++ types cross the boundary.** No `std::string`, no `std::vector`, no references, no templates — only C scalars, pointers, and length pairs. Strings become `const char*` + length; collections become pointer + count.
3. **Exceptions never escape.** Every shim function wraps its body in `try { ... } catch (...) { return error_code; }`. A C++ exception unwinding through a C frame is undefined behavior; the shim is where you convert exceptions to error codes.
4. **One owner, one allocator.** The side that allocates frees. If the shim returns a buffer, the shim provides the function to free it — never assume the caller's `free` matches your `new`.

This shim is the load-bearing wall of any C++ FFI. It is also where SWIG, cbindgen (for Rust), and every binding generator ultimately operate: they all produce or assume a C ABI surface.

### SWIG and Generated Bindings at Scale

Writing the shim by hand for a small surface is correct. For a large API — hundreds of functions, target bindings in Python, Java, C#, Ruby, and more — hand-writing every binding is unsustainable. **SWIG** reads an interface file (a `.i` that wraps your C/C++ headers) and generates the glue for many target languages at once: the C shim, the language-specific wrapper, type marshalling, and even proxy classes that map C++ objects to target-language objects.

What SWIG buys you: one interface description, N language bindings, regenerated on every header change. What it costs you: a generated layer you do not fully control, marshalling overhead you did not write, and sharp edges around ownership (SWIG's `%newobject` / `%delobject` directives exist precisely because it cannot infer ownership), templates, callbacks, and exceptions. The professional discipline is to treat the `.i` interface file as a real artifact — review it, narrow the exposed surface deliberately, and own the ownership annotations rather than letting the defaults leak resources. SWIG does not remove the need to understand the C ABI; it removes the need to type it N times.

### COM: vtables, IUnknown, and Refcount Discipline

COM is the canonical "cross-language objects via a binary contract" system, and it remains everywhere on Windows. A COM object exposes one or more **interfaces**, each a **vtable** — a table of function pointers with a fixed, agreed binary layout. Every interface derives from **IUnknown**, which provides three methods:

- `QueryInterface(iid, ppv)` — identity and discovery: "do you support interface X? if so, give me a pointer to it."
- `AddRef()` — increment the reference count.
- `Release()` — decrement; when the count hits zero, the object destroys itself.

Because the contract is *vtable layout + IUnknown*, any language that can call through a vtable and honor the refcount can use a COM object: C++, C#, VB, Delphi, scripting languages. That is the power. The danger is **manual reference counting**, which is the COM bug factory:

- **Refcount leak.** You obtain an interface pointer (which is an implicit `AddRef`, or an explicit one) and forget the matching `Release`. The object lives forever. In a long-running service this is a slow memory leak that takes weeks to manifest.
- **Over-release.** You `Release` once too often. The object frees while other holders still point at it — use-after-free, often a crash far from the bug.
- **`QueryInterface` ownership.** Every pointer `QueryInterface` hands back is a *new reference you own.* Forgetting to release it is the single most common COM leak.

The disciplines that tame this: **smart-pointer wrappers** (`CComPtr`, `ComPtr`, `_com_ptr_t`) that `AddRef`/`Release` in their constructor/destructor so the count is RAII-managed; the **"rule of AddRef/Release pairs"** audited in review; and treating any raw `AddRef`/`Release` call in modern code as a smell. WinRT and .NET COM interop largely automate the refcounting (runtime callable wrappers), but the moment you drop to raw COM, the count is yours.

### Polyglot VMs in Production

When all participating languages already target the JVM or CLR, interop is nearly free — Kotlin holds a real Java object, F# defines a type C# consumes as first-class. GraalVM generalizes this to JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and LLVM-based languages sharing one engine. In production this is the cheapest correct interop *if* you can pay the entry fee.

The professional caveats are about what the shared runtime does *not* give you:

- **It is not fault isolation.** One heap, one GC, one process. An `OutOfMemoryError`, a native crash in a JNI dependency, or a runaway thread takes down every language at once. Logical interop is not a crash boundary.
- **GC interop is the hard edge.** When a polyglot value references native memory (or two runtimes reference each other), neither GC can prove a cycle is dead. JNI global references, GraalVM host/guest references, and finalizer ordering are where polyglot-VM leaks and crashes live.
- **Performance is uneven.** GraalVM guest languages vary in maturity and peak performance; a Python-on-GraalVM workload may or may not beat CPython depending on the path.
- **Lock-in is real.** Committing a system to GraalVM polyglot is committing to that engine's lifecycle and operational model.

### Wasm Components: The Emerging Interop Answer

The Wasm Component Model with WIT is, in 2026, the most promising answer to the in-process interop problem because it gives the combination nothing else does: **near-native speed, strong sandboxing, language neutrality, portability, and a stable ABI.** You describe an interface once in WIT; any language with a component toolchain implements or consumes it; the toolchain lifts and lowers rich types (strings, lists, records, variants, `result`, `resource`) across the standardized canonical ABI.

What makes it the production-grade answer for the "run untrusted or third-party code in-process" problem:

- **Trap, don't corrupt.** A guest fault traps; the host survives and can report it. Compare to FFI, where a fault is a process death.
- **Capability security via WASI.** A component has no ambient authority — no filesystem, no sockets — until the host explicitly grants a preopened directory, a clock, a socket. "Run this plugin" becomes a bounded, auditable grant.
- **`resource` handles** are the principled successor to the opaque `void*`: they carry ownership across the boundary so the toolchain enforces "freed exactly once."
- **Portability.** The same component runs on any conforming runtime, on any host architecture.

The professional caveats: the ecosystem is young; toolchain support for advanced WIT features varies by source language; lift/lower has a real (if small) cost on large payloads; and version skew between a component and the interface it was built against is a live concern — pin and verify.

### RPC/IPC with an IDL

When the requirement is fault isolation, independent deployment, independent scaling, or a cross-machine boundary, the answer is RPC/IPC with an IDL. You describe the service contract in an IDL and a code generator produces stubs in every language. The major families and their trade-offs:

- **gRPC / Protobuf.** The default for service-to-service RPC. Compact binary wire format, HTTP/2 transport, streaming, strong cross-language tooling, and — critically — a disciplined schema-evolution story built on field numbers. The cost is a parse step (decode into language objects) on every message.
- **Apache Thrift.** Predates gRPC's ubiquity; similar IDL-plus-codegen model with a pluggable transport/protocol stack. Strong in polyglot shops with a Thrift legacy.
- **Cap'n Proto.** "Infinitely faster" by design: the wire format *is* the in-memory format, so there is no parse step — you read fields directly from the buffer (zero-copy). Trades a less compact wire and a more rigid layout for eliminating deserialization cost. Excellent when decode latency dominates.
- **FlatBuffers.** Also zero-copy / no-parse; you access data through generated accessors directly over the buffer. Popular in games and mobile where you want to mmap a buffer and read a few fields without materializing the whole structure.

The selection logic at scale: **choose Protobuf/gRPC when you want the richest ecosystem and disciplined evolution; choose Cap'n Proto or FlatBuffers when deserialization cost is your bottleneck and you can accept a more rigid format.** The defining property of all of them versus FFI is that the boundary is *serialized and isolated* — slower per call, but a true fault and evolution boundary.

### Schema-Evolution Discipline

An IDL boundary's whole value is that the two sides can evolve independently. That only holds if you obey evolution rules; violate them and you get silent data corruption or hard failures across a version boundary. The Protobuf discipline (and its analogs in Thrift) is the canonical example:

- **Field numbers are the contract, not field names.** Never reuse a retired field number; never renumber a live field. The wire carries tags, not names.
- **Adding a field is safe** if it is optional / has a sensible default. Old readers ignore unknown tags; new readers see the default when old writers omit it.
- **Removing a field:** stop writing it, but *reserve its number and name* so no future field accidentally reuses the tag.
- **Never change a field's type incompatibly.** `int32`→`int64` is sometimes safe; `string`→`int32` is never.
- **Required is forever a mistake.** Proto3 dropped `required` precisely because a required field can never be removed without breaking every old reader. Treat everything as optional.
- **Plan for unknown fields to round-trip.** A proxy that decodes and re-encodes should preserve unknown fields so it does not strip data added by a newer producer.

The professional artifact is a **compatibility test in CI**: serialize with schema version N, deserialize with N−1 and N+1, assert no loss. Schema evolution that is only checked by code review will eventually break in production.

### Choosing RPC Over FFI for Fault Isolation

The most important interop decision a professional makes is often choosing the *slower* mechanism on purpose. When a component is untrusted, crash-prone, written by another team, or must be deployed and scaled independently, **RPC's isolation is worth its latency.** The reasoning:

- **Crash containment.** A native library that segfaults under malformed input will kill your host process via FFI. Behind an RPC boundary it kills only its own process; your service returns a clean error and the supervisor restarts the worker. This alone justifies RPC for any code you do not fully trust.
- **Independent deployment and rollback.** FFI couples the foreign code's release to yours — you rebuild and redeploy your whole binary to update it. RPC lets each side ship and roll back on its own cadence.
- **Independent scaling.** A CPU-heavy component behind RPC can scale horizontally; the same code FFI'd into your process scales only with your process.
- **Language and runtime freedom.** The remote side can be any language, any runtime version, without ABI negotiation.
- **Blast-radius control.** A memory leak, a resource exhaustion, or a runaway loop in the remote component is contained; it does not consume your host's heap.

The cost you pay — serialization, a network/IPC hop, operational complexity — is real and must be measured. But when the dominant requirement is "this failure must not take down that," RPC is not the slow compromise; it is the correct architecture, and FFI would be the bug.

## Code Examples

### Flattening a C++ class to a C ABI shim

```cpp
// parser.hpp — the C++ API we cannot FFI into directly.
#include <string>
class Parser {
public:
    explicit Parser(const std::string& grammar);  // may throw
    int parse(const std::string& input);          // may throw
    ~Parser();
};
```

```cpp
// parser_c.cpp — the extern "C" shim: opaque handle, no C++ types, no exceptions.
#include "parser.hpp"

extern "C" {

typedef struct Parser Parser;  // opaque to the C side

// Construction: returns NULL on failure rather than throwing across the boundary.
Parser* parser_create(const char* grammar) {
    try {
        return reinterpret_cast<Parser*>(new ::Parser(grammar));
    } catch (...) {
        return nullptr;  // exceptions converted to a NULL/error signal
    }
}

// Operation: rich result reduced to an out-param + error code.
int parser_parse(Parser* p, const char* input, int* out_result) {
    if (!p || !input || !out_result) return -1;   // defensive
    try {
        *out_result = reinterpret_cast<::Parser*>(p)->parse(input);
        return 0;                                  // success
    } catch (...) {
        return -2;                                 // failure, no unwinding past C
    }
}

// Destruction: the side that allocated frees, with the matching allocator.
void parser_destroy(Parser* p) {
    delete reinterpret_cast<::Parser*>(p);
}

} // extern "C"
```

The four rules in one file: opaque handle, no C++ types crossing, exceptions caught at the boundary, allocation and deallocation owned by the same side. Any FFI caller — Python `ctypes`, Go `cgo`, C# P/Invoke — binds these flat functions.

### A Protobuf service and a compatible schema evolution

```protobuf
// payment.proto — version 1
syntax = "proto3";
package payment.v1;

message Charge {
  string id        = 1;
  int64  amount    = 2;   // minor units
  string currency  = 3;
}

service Payments {
  rpc CreateCharge(Charge) returns (Charge);
}
```

Evolving it compatibly — add fields, never reuse numbers, never break old readers:

```protobuf
// payment.proto — version 2, wire-compatible with v1
syntax = "proto3";
package payment.v1;

message Charge {
  string id          = 1;
  int64  amount      = 2;
  string currency    = 3;
  string description = 4;   // NEW: optional, old readers ignore tag 4
  string customer_id = 5;   // NEW: old writers omit it, new readers see ""

  reserved 6;               // a field once existed at 6; never reuse the tag
  reserved "legacy_token";  // and never reuse the name
}
```

An old client sending a v1 `Charge` is read correctly by a v2 server (missing fields default). A new client sending fields 4 and 5 is read by a v1 server, which ignores the unknown tags. That is the contract holding across a version boundary.

### A WIT interface and the components that meet it

```wit
// filter.wit — the language-neutral contract for an in-process plugin.
package plugins:filter;

interface transform {
    // result<T, E> gives a typed error channel instead of a process crash.
    apply: func(input: list<u8>) -> result<list<u8>, string>;
}

world plugin {
    export transform;
}
```

A guest (Rust, Go, C#, …) compiles to a component implementing `transform`; the host loads it sandboxed, grants only the capabilities it needs, and calls `apply`. A `panic` in the guest traps and surfaces as a host-side error — the host process survives, which is exactly what an in-process FFI plugin could never promise.

### A COM interface and RAII refcount discipline

```cpp
// The interface contract: IUnknown + one method, fixed vtable layout.
struct IFilter : IUnknown {
    virtual HRESULT __stdcall Apply(const BYTE* in, ULONG n, BYTE** out, ULONG* m) = 0;
};

// WRONG: manual refcounting — every early return is a leak waiting to happen.
void use_filter_raw(IFilter* f) {
    f->AddRef();
    // ... if any branch returns here without Release(), the object leaks ...
    f->Release();
}

// RIGHT: RAII wrapper pairs AddRef/Release with scope; no manual counting.
void use_filter_raii(IFilter* raw) {
    ComPtr<IFilter> f(raw);   // AddRef in ctor
    BYTE* out = nullptr; ULONG m = 0;
    f->Apply(/*...*/ &out, &m);
    // Release() runs in ComPtr's destructor on every exit path, including throws.
}
```

The lesson the senior tier stated and the professional tier enforces in review: **raw `AddRef`/`Release` is a smell; lifetime belongs to a scoped wrapper.**

## Coding Patterns

- **Tiny boundary surface.** Whatever the mechanism, minimize the number of functions/types crossing. A small boundary is a small bug surface and a small thing to evolve.
- **Shim-first for C++.** Always interpose an `extern "C"` layer; never expose C++ types or let exceptions escape.
- **Opaque handles, never raw layouts.** Pass `Parser*`, not a struct the other side parses. The other side must not depend on your layout.
- **RAII for every foreign lifetime.** COM `ComPtr`, FFI handle wrappers, WIT `resource` — bind lifetime to scope so no path leaks.
- **IDL-first for RPC and Wasm.** Write the `.proto` / WIT before the implementation; the contract is the durable artifact.
- **Reserve, never reuse.** Retired field numbers and names are reserved forever.
- **Capability-minimal.** Grant a Wasm component exactly the directory/socket/clock it needs, nothing more.
- **Compatibility tests in CI.** Round-trip serialize/deserialize across adjacent schema versions as a gate.

---

## Best Practices

- **Choose the mechanism by the dominant constraint** — latency, isolation, portability, team boundaries — not by what the team used last.
- **Treat the interop choice as hard to reverse** and design it with that gravity.
- **Use shared-runtime interop wherever languages already share a runtime.** It is strictly the cheapest correct option there.
- **Pick RPC when fault isolation, independent deploy, or independent scaling is the requirement** — and measure the latency cost so the trade is explicit, not assumed.
- **Reach for Wasm components when you need speed *and* a sandbox** for untrusted or third-party in-process code.
- **Keep the boundary narrow, flat, and richly documented** with ownership and threading contracts.
- **Make schema evolution a tested invariant**, not a code-review hope.
- **Manage every foreign lifetime with RAII**; raw refcount or raw free calls are a review smell.
- **Document the crash domain** of every boundary explicitly, so on-call knows whether a foreign fault is contained.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Defaulting to the familiar mechanism.** The microservices team RPC-ing an in-process call; the C++ team FFI-ing a security perimeter. The framework exists to break this reflex.
- **Assuming polyglot VMs give isolation.** They share a process; one fault kills every language. Logical interop ≠ fault isolation.
- **Exceptions escaping the C boundary.** A C++ exception unwinding through a C frame is undefined behavior. Catch all at the shim.
- **Allocator mismatch.** Freeing with the caller's `free` what the library allocated with `new` (or a different CRT). Always provide the matching free function.
- **COM refcount leaks and over-releases.** A missing `Release` leaks forever; an extra one frees early and crashes other holders. `QueryInterface` results are owned references.
- **Reusing a retired Protobuf field number.** Silent data corruption across versions. Reserve forever.
- **`required` fields in an IDL.** They can never be removed without breaking old readers. Treat everything as optional.
- **Stripping unknown fields in a proxy.** A decode/re-encode that drops unknown tags silently deletes data from newer producers.
- **Ignoring lift/lower cost.** The Component Model copies large records and lists across the canonical ABI; on ultra-hot paths, measure.
- **Over-granting WASI capabilities.** Handing a component the filesystem root "to be safe" defeats the sandbox.
- **ABI skew from a toolchain bump.** A compiler or flag change silently changes struct layout or calling convention; pin and test the boundary.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Cross-Language Interop** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Cross-Language Interop?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
