# FFI Safety & Pitfalls — Senior Level

> **Topic:** FFI Safety & Pitfalls
> **Focus:** Threading and reentrancy across the boundary, resource and robustness hazards, and the discipline that makes an FFI surface auditable: a thin, validated unsafe boundary wrapping a safe API.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What happens when threads, callbacks, signals, and long-lived resources meet the FFI boundary — and what discipline turns an inherently unsafe interface into one you can audit and trust?**

The junior and middle tiers covered the boundary's loss of safety and the four core hazard classes (ownership, ABI, error handling, GC interaction). At the senior level we add the two hazard classes that bite hardest in real production systems — **threading/reentrancy** and **resource/robustness** — and then step back to the question that actually distinguishes senior FFI work: *how do you structure an FFI surface so that a reviewer can convince themselves it is correct?*

The answer, distilled from the Rust ecosystem but applicable everywhere, is **a thin, audited unsafe boundary wrapping a safe API.** The unsafe operations — the raw pointers, the manual frees, the type punning — are confined to a small, heavily-validated layer. Everything above that layer is ordinary safe code that cannot misuse the boundary because the boundary will not let it. The unsafe surface is small enough to read in one sitting and prove correct; the safe surface is large and used everywhere.

In one sentence: **senior FFI is the art of making the dangerous part small, validated, and provably correct, so the rest of the system can stay safe.** This page covers the threading and robustness hazards in depth, the playbook for the audited boundary, and the real incidents that show what happens when teams skip it.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at the senior level:** You are the person who designs the FFI integration, reviews it, and owns the on-call pager when it crashes a service at 3 a.m. The threading and lifetime interactions you allow into the design determine whether the system is debuggable or a haunted house. The discipline you enforce on the boundary determines whether a junior can extend it without introducing UB.

## Prerequisites

What you should know before reading this:

- **Required:** The middle-level hazard taxonomy — ownership/lifetime, ABI/type, error handling, GC-versus-native.
- **Required:** Working knowledge of threads, the difference between thread-safe and non-thread-safe code, and what a deadlock is.
- **Required:** Familiarity with how a garbage-collected runtime schedules work (the Python GIL, the JVM, goroutines and the Go scheduler).
- **Helpful but not required:** Having written a non-trivial FFI wrapper yourself.
- **Helpful but not required:** Awareness of `async-signal-safe` functions and the constraints on signal handlers.

You do **not** need to know:

- Out-of-process isolation architectures in depth (that is `professional.md`).
- The full memory model of any one runtime (covered in the concurrency topics).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Reentrancy** | The property that a function can be safely re-entered (called again before a previous call completes), including via a callback. Many C libraries are *not* reentrant. |
| **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** | CPython's lock that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. Must be released around blocking native calls and held whenever touching Python objects. |
| **Attach / detach (JNI)** | A native thread not created by the JVM must call `AttachCurrentThread` before it can make JNI calls, and `DetachCurrentThread` when done. |
| **Local reference (JNI)** | A JNI reference to a Java object, valid only within the current native call and on the current thread, freed automatically when the native method returns. Limited in number. |
| **Global reference (JNI)** | A JNI reference that survives across calls and threads; must be explicitly deleted or it leaks. |
| **Callback** | A function pointer you give to a C library so it can call *back* into your code. The place where threading, reentrancy, and exception rules collide. |
| **Async-signal-safe** | The small set of operations permitted inside a Unix signal handler. Most runtime calls (allocation, locks) are *not* async-signal-safe. |
| **RAII** | "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization." Tying a resource's lifetime to an object's scope so cleanup is automatic. Does not naturally cross the FFI boundary. |
| **Audited boundary** | A small, deliberately-unsafe layer where all FFI operations live, exhaustively validated, wrapping a safe API used by everyone else. |
| **`-Xcheck:jni`** | A JVM flag that enables extensive runtime checking of JNI usage (bad references, pending exceptions, wrong-thread calls). Essential during development. |
| **Native handle leak** | Failing to release a native resource (file descriptor, library handle, global reference) acquired through FFI. |
| **Out-of-process isolation** | Running unstable or untrusted native code in a separate process so its crash cannot take down the main process. |

## Core Concepts

### Hazard Class 5: Threading & Reentrancy

This class is where FFI bugs become *intermittent* and therefore worst to debug. The boundary connects two threading worlds that do not share assumptions.

**The Python GIL.** CPython lets only one thread run Python bytecode at a time. Two rules follow for FFI:

- **Release the GIL around blocking or long native calls.** If a C function blocks (network, disk, a long compute) while holding the GIL, *every other Python thread is frozen* — and if that C call tries to call back into Python, you deadlock. `ctypes` releases the GIL around foreign calls by default; hand-written C extensions use the `Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS` / `Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` macros.
- **Never touch a Python object without holding the GIL.** If native code (on a thread you released the GIL on, or a thread C created) manipulates `PyObject`s without re-acquiring the GIL (`PyGILState_Ensure`), it corrupts the interpreter. Refcount updates are not atomic under the boundary unless the GIL is held.

**JNI thread attach/detach.** A Java thread can make JNI calls freely. But a *native* thread — one the C library created — cannot touch the JVM until it calls `AttachCurrentThread` to get a valid `JNIEnv`, and must `DetachCurrentThread` before it dies. Forgetting to attach is a crash; forgetting to detach can leak or, on some JVMs, prevent shutdown. Critically, **a `JNIEnv*` is per-thread and must never be cached and reused on a different thread.**

**Which thread does the callback run on?** When you give a C library a callback, you must learn *which thread it will be invoked from*. The library may call back synchronously on your thread, or asynchronously from an internal worker thread, or from a thread pool. Each case has different rules: a callback from a foreign thread must attach to the JVM, must acquire the GIL, must not assume thread-local state from the calling thread exists.

**Calling back into the runtime from the wrong thread.** The recurring failure: native code invokes your callback from a thread the runtime does not know about, and the callback touches managed state as if it were on a managed thread. The defense is to make callbacks self-contained: attach/acquire as needed, do minimal work, and hand off to the runtime's own thread (e.g. post to an event loop, a Go channel, a Java executor) rather than doing managed work inline on the foreign thread.

**Signal-handler restrictions.** If a native library installs signal handlers, or if your FFI runs inside one, remember that almost nothing is safe inside a signal handler — not allocation, not most locks, not most runtime calls. A handler that calls back into a managed runtime is a latent deadlock or crash.

**Thread-safety of the native library itself.** Many C libraries are not thread-safe, or are thread-safe only with a per-context object. If two of your threads call a non-reentrant library concurrently, you corrupt its internal state. You must serialize access (a lock around the library) or give each thread its own context. Read the library's threading documentation as carefully as its memory documentation.

**cgo and the Go scheduler.** A cgo call blocks the OS thread it runs on for the call's duration; the Go scheduler moves other goroutines to other threads, but a flood of blocking cgo calls can exhaust the thread pool. Go also forbids passing Go pointers that themselves contain Go pointers into C (the cgo pointer-passing rules), precisely because the collector cannot track them across the boundary.

### Hazard Class 6: Resource Leaks & Robustness

**Native handle and reference leaks.** Every native resource acquired through FFI — file descriptors, library handles, JNI global references, allocated buffers — must be released on *every* path, including error paths. JNI is notorious here: **local references accumulate** within a long native method (e.g. a loop creating many Java objects), and if you do not delete them or manage a local frame, you hit the local-reference table limit and crash. **Global references leak** if you allocate them and never delete them — a slow memory growth that eventually OOMs a long-running service.

**RAII does not cross the boundary.** Your language's automatic cleanup (Rust `Drop`, C++ destructors, Python `__del__`, `try-with-resources`) does not run when control is on the C side, and C's cleanup does not run when control is on yours. You must bridge cleanup explicitly: a wrapper object whose destructor calls the C free function, registered so it runs even on the error path.

**No isolation: a native crash kills the process.** This is the robustness fact that drives architecture. There is no `try/catch` for a segfault in native code. One bug in one native call takes down the entire process — every request in flight, every other tenant. When the native code is **untrusted** (parsing attacker-controlled input) or **unstable** (a flaky third-party library, a GPU driver), the only robust answer is **out-of-process isolation**: run the native code in a separate process, talk to it over a pipe or socket, and when it crashes, restart just that process. You trade IPC overhead for blast-radius containment. (Expanded at the professional level.)

### The Discipline: A Thin, Audited Unsafe Boundary

Everything above argues for one architectural pattern, which the Rust community formalized but every language can apply:

1. **Confine unsafe operations to a small module.** All raw pointers, manual frees, type casts, and FFI declarations live in one place — the `unsafe`/`extern` layer. Nothing outside it touches a raw pointer.
2. **Validate everything at the boundary.** Null-check, bounds-check, validate enums and lengths, reject malformed input *before* it reaches C. The boundary assumes the outside (and untrusted input) is hostile.
3. **Expose a safe API.** Above the boundary, callers see ordinary safe types (a `String`, a `Vec`, an idiomatic error). They *cannot* trigger UB because the unsafe layer does not give them the tools to.
4. **Encode ownership in types.** A handle wrapper that frees in its destructor; a lifetime parameter that prevents using a borrowed buffer after it is freed; a non-`Copy` owning type so it cannot be double-freed.
5. **Document every contract.** Each unsafe function states its safety precondition ("`ptr` must be non-null and point to `len` valid bytes"). The reviewer checks the call sites against the contract.
6. **Test the boundary under sanitizers and checkers.** ASan/Valgrind for memory, TSan for threading, `-Xcheck:jni` for JNI, the cgo `cgocheck` and `-race` flags for Go. These catch what review misses.
7. **Minimize the surface.** Fewer FFI functions, simpler data, opaque handles over shared structs. Every function in the boundary is a function someone must audit.
8. **Isolate when robustness demands it.** For untrusted or unstable native code, put a process boundary around it.

The payoff: the dangerous code is small enough to prove correct and rarely changes; the safe code is large, idiomatic, and cannot misuse the boundary.

### Real Incidents (Defensive Lessons)

These are the shapes of real production failures; study them as failure modes to engineer against.

- **JNI reference leaks crashing services.** Long-running JVM services that create JNI global references in a native callback and never delete them grow memory until they OOM-kill — a slow, hard-to-attribute leak. A loop creating local references without a local frame hits the reference-table limit and crashes outright. The fix is disciplined reference management and `-Xcheck:jni` in CI.
- **`ctypes` `restype`/`argtypes` mistakes corrupting results.** Production Python code that omitted `restype` for a function returning a pointer or `size_t` read a truncated value and either crashed or silently produced wrong data on certain inputs. The fix is explicit, reviewed type declarations and tests across value ranges.
- **Panic/exception across FFI as UB.** Libraries exposing `extern "C"` functions that let a Rust panic or C++ exception unwind into a C caller exhibited crashes and corruption that varied by compiler and optimization level. The fix is `catch_unwind`/`catch(...)`/`recover` at every export.
- **GC-collected object used by native code.** .NET and JVM integrations where a managed object backing a native pointer was collected or moved mid-call crashed only under load (when the GC actually ran). The fix is `GC.KeepAlive`/pinning for the precise lifetime of the native use.

## Real-World Analogies

**The embassy.** Your runtime is a country with its own laws (the GIL, the GC, exceptions). A native thread entering to do business is a foreigner who must first present papers at the embassy (JNI attach, acquire the GIL) before doing anything official, and must check out before leaving (detach, release). A foreigner who wanders into government offices without papers (touches managed state on an unattached thread) causes an international incident (a crash).

**The bomb-disposal robot.** When the package might explode (untrusted or unstable native code), you do not open it on your desk — you put it behind a blast wall and operate it remotely (out-of-process isolation). If it goes off, you lose the robot, not the building. Choosing in-process versus out-of-process is choosing how much blast wall you want.

**The clean-room with one airlock.** The audited boundary is a single, tightly-controlled airlock into the clean room. All contamination control happens there; inside, people work normally because nothing dirty can get past the airlock. Spreading FFI calls all over the codebase is like cutting a dozen unguarded doors into the clean room.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: "Which thread, and is it allowed here?"** For every callback and every native thread, ask: which thread runs this, does the runtime know about it, and is it permitted to touch managed state? If you cannot answer, you have a latent intermittent crash.

**Model 2: "The unsafe part should be small enough to prove."** Measure your FFI surface by how long it would take a reviewer to convince themselves it has no UB. If the answer is "longer than an afternoon," the boundary is too big or too leaky.

**Model 3: "Cleanup must be bridged explicitly."** Neither side's automatic cleanup runs on the other side. Every native resource needs a wrapper that frees it on all paths.

**Model 4: "Blast radius is an architectural choice."** In-process FFI means one native crash kills everything. If that is unacceptable for some code, the boundary must be a process boundary.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Releasing and re-acquiring the GIL (CPython C extension)

```c
static PyObject *do_blocking_work(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
    long n;
    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "l", &n)) return NULL;

    long result;
    Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS          /* ✅ release the GIL: other Python threads run */
    result = expensive_native_call(n);   /* no Python objects touched here */
    Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS            /* ✅ re-acquire before touching Python again */

    return PyLong_FromLong(result); /* now safe to build a Python object */
}
```

The blocking call runs without the GIL so the rest of the program stays responsive; the GIL is re-acquired before any `PyObject` is created. Touching a `PyObject` between the two macros would corrupt the interpreter.

### Example 2: A native thread attaching to the JVM (JNI)

```c
/* Called from a thread the C library created — the JVM does not know it yet. */
void on_native_event(MyContext *ctx, int code) {
    JNIEnv *env;
    JavaVM *vm = ctx->vm;

    /* ✅ attach: obtain a valid JNIEnv for THIS thread */
    if ((*vm)->AttachCurrentThread(vm, (void **)&env, NULL) != JNI_OK) return;

    jclass cls = (*env)->GetObjectClass(env, ctx->listener);
    jmethodID mid = (*env)->GetMethodID(env, cls, "onEvent", "(I)V");
    (*env)->CallVoidMethod(env, ctx->listener, mid, code);

    /* ✅ check for a pending Java exception before doing anything else */
    if ((*env)->ExceptionCheck(env)) {
        (*env)->ExceptionDescribe(env);
        (*env)->ExceptionClear(env);
    }

    (*env)->DeleteLocalRef(env, cls);           /* avoid local-ref accumulation */
    (*vm)->DetachCurrentThread(vm);             /* ✅ detach before the thread exits */
}
```

Three senior rules in one function: attach the foreign thread, check-and-clear the pending exception after a call that can throw, and detach before the thread dies.

### Example 3: Managing JNI local references in a loop (the leak that crashes)

```c
/* Creating many objects in one native call: local refs accumulate. */
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    /* ✅ bound the local-reference table with a frame per iteration */
    if ((*env)->PushLocalFrame(env, 16) != 0) return;

    jobject item = build_item(env, i);     /* creates local refs */
    process(env, item);

    (*env)->PopLocalFrame(env, NULL);      /* ✅ frees all locals from this frame */
}
```

Without the local frame (or explicit `DeleteLocalRef`), a long loop exhausts the local-reference table and crashes. This is a classic JNI production incident.

### Example 4: The audited boundary — thin unsafe layer, safe API (Rust)

```rust
// ---- the ENTIRE unsafe surface, small and validated ----
mod ffi {
    use std::os::raw::{c_char, c_int};
    extern "C" {
        pub fn parse_doc(input: *const c_char, len: usize) -> *mut Doc;
        pub fn doc_free(doc: *mut Doc);
        pub fn doc_title(doc: *const Doc) -> *const c_char;
    }
    pub enum Doc {}   // opaque: we never look inside
}

// ---- the safe API everyone above uses ----
pub struct Document(*mut ffi::Doc);   // owns the native resource

impl Document {
    pub fn parse(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Document, ParseError> {
        // ✅ validate at the boundary before touching C
        if input.is_empty() { return Err(ParseError::Empty); }
        let ptr = unsafe { ffi::parse_doc(input.as_ptr() as *const _, input.len()) };
        if ptr.is_null() { return Err(ParseError::Invalid); }  // ✅ null-check
        Ok(Document(ptr))
    }

    pub fn title(&self) -> String {
        let c = unsafe { ffi::doc_title(self.0) };
        if c.is_null() { return String::new(); }
        unsafe { std::ffi::CStr::from_ptr(c) }.to_string_lossy().into_owned()
    }
}

impl Drop for Document {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // ✅ RAII bridges cleanup across the boundary; freed exactly once
        unsafe { ffi::doc_free(self.0) }
    }
}
```

`Document` cannot be double-freed (it owns the pointer and frees once on `Drop`), cannot be used after free (its lifetime governs the pointer), and validates input before calling C. Callers above never see a raw pointer.

### Example 5: Serializing access to a non-thread-safe library (Go)

```go
var libMu sync.Mutex   // the C library is not thread-safe

func Process(data []byte) (Result, error) {
    libMu.Lock()                 // ✅ serialize: only one goroutine in the library
    defer libMu.Unlock()

    cData := C.CBytes(data)
    defer C.free(cData)          // ✅ matching free on all paths

    rc := C.lib_process(cData, C.size_t(len(data)))
    if rc != 0 {
        return Result{}, fmt.Errorf("lib_process failed: %d", int(rc))
    }
    return readResult(), nil
}
```

If the C library keeps global state and is not reentrant, the mutex is the difference between correct results and silent corruption under concurrency.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros of the senior discipline (audited boundary + isolation where needed):**

- **Auditability.** A small unsafe surface can be reviewed to a high confidence; UB has nowhere to hide.
- **Containment.** Out-of-process isolation bounds the blast radius of native crashes.
- **Debuggability.** Clear thread rules and explicit cleanup make intermittent bugs reproducible.

**Cons / costs:**

- **Design effort.** Encoding ownership in types and confining unsafe code takes more thought than scattering FFI calls.
- **Performance.** Locking a non-thread-safe library serializes it; out-of-process isolation adds IPC and serialization overhead.
- **Complexity.** Attach/detach, GIL management, and local-frame discipline are extra moving parts.

The trade is firmly worth it for anything beyond a throwaway script: the alternative is unbounded, intermittent, production-only failures.

---

## Use Cases

- **Wrapping a non-thread-safe C library** for use from a concurrent service — requires serialization or per-thread contexts.
- **Native callbacks delivered on foreign threads** — event-driven libraries, GUI toolkits, hardware drivers.
- **Parsing untrusted input in C** (media codecs, document parsers) — the canonical case for validation-at-the-boundary plus out-of-process isolation.
- **Long-running JVM/.NET services** that integrate native code — where reference and handle leaks accumulate into OOMs over days.

---

## Coding Patterns

**Pattern 1: One unsafe module, everything else safe.** Confine all FFI and raw-pointer code to a single, small, reviewable module.

**Pattern 2: Own the handle in a wrapper type with a destructor.** Free exactly once on all paths; make the type non-copyable so it cannot be double-freed.

**Pattern 3: Validate at the edge.** Null-check, bounds-check, validate enums and lengths before C sees the data.

**Pattern 4: Attach/acquire in every foreign-thread callback.** JNI attach + exception check, or `PyGILState_Ensure`, then do minimal work and hand off to a runtime-owned thread.

**Pattern 5: Bound JNI local references.** Use local frames in loops; delete globals explicitly.

**Pattern 6: Serialize or partition non-thread-safe libraries.** A lock around the library, or one context per thread.

**Pattern 7: Isolate untrusted/unstable native code in a separate process.** Contain the crash.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Know which thread every callback runs on,** and attach/acquire accordingly.
2. **Release the GIL around blocking native calls; never touch Python objects without it.**
3. **Attach native threads to the JVM, check-and-clear exceptions, detach before exit; never share a `JNIEnv` across threads.**
4. **Manage JNI references** with local frames and explicit global deletion.
5. **Confine unsafe code to a thin, validated boundary; expose a safe API; encode ownership in types.**
6. **Bridge cleanup explicitly** with wrapper destructors that run on all paths.
7. **Run TSan, ASan/Valgrind, `-Xcheck:jni`, `-race`/`cgocheck`** in CI.
8. **Isolate untrusted or unstable native code out-of-process.**
9. **Minimize the FFI surface;** prefer opaque handles.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Cached `JNIEnv` reused on another thread.** A `JNIEnv*` is per-thread; reusing it elsewhere is UB. Always fetch it from `AttachCurrentThread` on the current thread.
- **Callback re-enters a non-reentrant library.** The library calls your callback, and your callback calls back into the library while it is mid-operation. If the library is non-reentrant, this corrupts it.
- **GIL deadlock.** Native code holds the GIL and blocks waiting on a Python thread that needs the GIL. Release before blocking.
- **Signal handler calls the runtime.** A handler that allocates or locks (e.g. calls back into managed code) deadlocks or crashes; signal handlers are restricted to async-signal-safe operations.
- **cgo thread exhaustion.** Many simultaneous blocking cgo calls consume OS threads; the Go runtime may spawn many threads or stall. Bound concurrency.
- **Global reference leak in a callback.** A native callback that creates a JNI global reference per event and never deletes it slowly OOMs the service.
- **Cleanup skipped on the error path.** An early return between acquire and release of a native handle leaks it. Use `defer`/RAII/`finally`.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. Touching managed state (Python objects, Java objects) from a foreign thread without acquiring/attaching.
2. Caching and reusing a `JNIEnv*` across threads.
3. Holding the GIL across a blocking native call.
4. Accumulating JNI local references in a loop; leaking global references.
5. Calling a non-thread-safe C library concurrently without serialization.
6. Letting cleanup be skipped on an error path.
7. Spreading raw FFI calls throughout the codebase instead of confining them.
8. Running untrusted native parsers in-process and being surprised by a crash.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Intermittent by nature.** Threading and GC FFI bugs reproduce only under specific timing or load, so green tests prove little. Sanitizers and stress tests under TSan are how you find them.
- **"Thread-safe" has fine print.** A library may be thread-safe only with one context per thread, or only for read operations. Read precisely.
- **The callback's thread is the library's choice, not yours.** Never assume the callback runs on the thread that registered it.
- **Out-of-process is sometimes the *only* correct answer.** For genuinely untrusted input, no amount of in-process care removes the fact that one bug crashes everything.

---

## Test Yourself

1. Why must you release the GIL around a blocking native call, and what must you re-do before touching a Python object afterward?
2. What three things must a native thread do to safely call a Java method via JNI?
3. How does a loop in a long JNI native method crash the JVM, and how do you prevent it?
4. Describe the "thin audited boundary" pattern and why it makes UB easier to rule out.
5. When is out-of-process isolation the right architecture for native code?
6. Why is a callback delivered on a foreign thread a hazard, and what is the safe handling pattern?

<details>
<summary>Answers</summary>

1. If a blocking call holds the GIL, all other Python threads freeze (and a call back into Python deadlocks). Re-acquire the GIL (`Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS` / `PyGILState_Ensure`) before touching any `PyObject`.
2. Attach the thread (`AttachCurrentThread` to get a `JNIEnv`), check-and-clear pending exceptions after calls that can throw, and detach (`DetachCurrentThread`) before the thread exits — and never reuse a `JNIEnv` across threads.
3. Each created Java object adds a local reference; a long loop exhausts the local-reference table and crashes. Prevent it with `PushLocalFrame`/`PopLocalFrame` per iteration or explicit `DeleteLocalRef`.
4. All unsafe/FFI operations live in one small module that validates everything and exposes only safe types; callers cannot trigger UB because they never get a raw pointer. The small surface is reviewable to high confidence.
5. When the native code is untrusted (attacker-controlled input) or unstable (flaky third party), so a crash must not take down the main process; the process boundary contains the blast radius.
6. The library chooses the thread, which the runtime may not know about; touching managed state there is UB. Safely: attach/acquire, do minimal work, hand off to a runtime-owned thread (event loop, channel, executor).

|--------|----------------|
| GIL deadlock / frozen threads | Release GIL around blocking calls; reacquire before any PyObject |
| Foreign thread + JNI | Attach, exception-check, detach; never share `JNIEnv` |
| JNI ref leak | Local frames in loops; delete globals explicitly; `-Xcheck:jni` |
| Non-thread-safe library | Serialize with a lock or use per-thread contexts |
| Callback on unknown thread | Assume foreign; attach/acquire, minimal work, hand off |
| Signal handler | Async-signal-safe only; never call into the runtime |
| Cleanup skipped | Wrapper destructor / `defer` / `finally` on all paths |
| Native crash kills process | Audited boundary; out-of-process isolation for untrusted/unstable code |

## Summary

At the senior level, two hazard classes dominate real incidents. **Threading and reentrancy**: the GIL must be released around blocking calls and held whenever touching Python objects; native threads must attach to the JVM, check exceptions, and detach, never sharing a `JNIEnv`; callbacks run on whatever thread the library chooses, so they must attach/acquire and hand off to a runtime-owned thread; non-thread-safe libraries must be serialized; signal handlers and cgo have their own restrictions. **Resource and robustness**: native handles and JNI references leak unless released on every path; RAII does not cross the boundary, so cleanup must be bridged explicitly; and because a native crash kills the whole process, untrusted or unstable native code belongs out-of-process. Tying it together is the discipline of a **thin, audited unsafe boundary** that validates everything and exposes a safe API, encoding ownership in types and confining all dangerous operations to a small, reviewable surface — verified under ASan/Valgrind/TSan/`-Xcheck:jni`. The real-world incidents — JNI reference leaks, `ctypes` `restype` mistakes, panic-across-FFI UB, GC-collected objects used by native code — are exactly the failures this discipline prevents.
