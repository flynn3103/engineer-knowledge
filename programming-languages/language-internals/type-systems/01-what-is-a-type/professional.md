## Introduction

> Focus: **What does a type *cost*, *guarantee*, and *enable* in a real system?** And how do staff-level engineers wield "a type" as a lever to delete entire categories of incidents?

By this level you know what a type is from several angles — a set of values with operations, a contract, a proposition with values as proofs, an interface. This page is about the engineering consequences: the places where the abstract notion of "type" cashes out into bytes, latency, incident counts, and the design decisions you defend in a review.

Four threads run through it:

1. **A type is a representation decision.** The compiler turns "this is an `int32`" into "four bytes, two's-complement, here." A type's *logical* identity and its *physical* layout are linked but distinct, and senior engineers exploit the gap (newtypes with zero runtime cost, niche-filling optimizations, cache-friendly struct layout).
2. **Type safety and memory safety are different guarantees.** Conflating them causes real incidents. You can have type safety without memory safety and vice versa; the most valuable systems work has them as separate, deliberately-chosen dials.
3. **The "type of a type."** Just as values have types, types have **kinds**. `int` has kind `*` (a concrete type); `List` is `* → *` (a type that *takes* a type). Knowing this prevents a class of confusions and unlocks higher-kinded abstractions.
4. **Types as the cheapest tests.** The professional payoff: a type catches a bug at compile time, once, for every input and call site — cheaper than any test, review, or runtime assertion. "Make illegal states unrepresentable" stops being a slogan and becomes an incident-reduction strategy you can quantify.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at this level:** At scale, the question isn't "static or dynamic?" It's "which guarantees do I buy with types, what do they cost in compile time / runtime / cognitive load, and which incident classes do they eliminate?" A staff engineer who says "we'll model this as a sum type so the impossible state can't reach production" is making a risk-and-cost argument, not a stylistic one.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The senior-level lenses — types-as-sets and its limits, Curry–Howard (types as propositions, values as proofs), interfaces/capabilities, uni-typed dynamics.
- **Required:** The middle-level static/dynamic, inference, erasure, and soundness framework.
- **Required:** Real exposure to a systems language (C, C++, Rust, Go) *and* a managed one (Java, C#, Python, TS); ideally you've debugged a layout, alignment, or `null` bug in production.
- **Helpful but not required:** Familiarity with generics/templates, higher-kinded types or their absence, and serialization boundaries.
- **Helpful but not required:** Having read a struct's memory layout in a debugger or with `sizeof`/`offsetof`.

You do **not** need:

- A compiler-construction background; representation is discussed at the engineering level, not as codegen internals.
- Category theory; kinds are introduced operationally.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Type vs Representation: Same Logic, Different Bytes

A type has a *logical* identity (what it means, what operations it supports) and a *physical* representation (how the compiler stores it). These usually move together but are deliberately separable, and that separation is an engineering tool:

- **A `bool` is logically `{true, false}`** but is typically *represented* as one byte (sometimes a full word for alignment). The representation has 254 unused bit-patterns.
- **A newtype `UserId(u64)`** is logically distinct from a `ProductId(u64)` but has the *identical* representation — eight bytes — with **zero runtime cost**. The distinction exists only at compile time; at run time both are just a `u64`. This is the professional's favorite trick: buy type safety, pay nothing at run time.
- **Niche-filling** exploits unused bit-patterns: Rust's `Option<&T>` is the same size as `&T` because the null pointer (an invalid `&T`) is reused to mean `None`. The *type* `Option<&T>` has more values than `&T`, but its *representation* fits in the same bytes by stealing an invalid pattern. Logical cardinality went up; physical size didn't.

The discipline: **decouple the type you reason with from the bytes it costs.** You can refine types aggressively for safety (`Meters`, `Sanitized`, `NonZeroU32`) while paying little or nothing in representation, provided the compiler can erase the distinction.

### 2. A Type Is the Compiler's Layout Contract

For compiled languages, the type *is* the instruction to the code generator: how many bytes, what alignment, how to pass in registers vs on the stack, how to read each field. Practical consequences staff engineers manage:

- **Struct field order affects size** because of alignment padding. `struct { a: u8; b: u64; c: u8 }` may take 24 bytes (padding around the `u64`), while reordering to `{ b: u64; a: u8; c: u8 }` takes 16. The *type's logical content* is identical; the *layout* — and the cache behavior — differs.
- **Sum types cost a discriminant** plus the largest variant. An enum of `{ A(u8), B([u8; 1024]) }` costs ~1025 bytes per value *even when it's the `A` case*, because the representation must fit the worst case. This drives decisions like boxing the large variant.
- **Generics force a representation choice**: *monomorphization* (C++ templates, Rust generics — one specialized copy per type, fast but code-bloating) vs *boxing/type-erasure* (Java generics, Go interfaces — one copy, uniform pointer representation, an indirection per use). The *same* generic type yields different machine code under each strategy.

When you choose a type, you're choosing a memory and performance profile, not just a logical category.

### 3. Type Safety vs Memory Safety — Two Different Dials

This distinction is the source of more confused incident postmortems than almost anything else. They are *related but independent* guarantees:

- **Type safety** = operations are only applied to operands of compatible type. Violation: treating an `int` as a function pointer and "calling" it.
- **Memory safety** = no out-of-bounds access, use-after-free, double-free, or reading uninitialized memory. Violation: `arr[10]` on a length-5 array, or dereferencing a freed pointer.

The four quadrants are all real:

| | Memory-safe | Memory-unsafe |
|--|-------------|---------------|
| **Type-safe** | Java, Go, Python, Rust (safe) | (rare; type-safe but can corrupt — some FFI boundaries) |
| **Type-unsafe** | (rare in practice) | C, C++, assembly, Rust `unsafe` |

Key points for production:

- **Losing type safety usually opens the door to losing memory safety.** A type confusion (treating bytes as a pointer) is the classic exploit primitive — type-confusion CVEs in browsers and VMs are memory-corruption bugs that *start* as type violations.
- **You can be memory-safe but type-confused.** A dynamic language won't corrupt memory, but a value-of-wrong-type bug can still produce a logically catastrophic result (charging the wrong account).
- **Rust's design is the clearest articulation**: safe Rust is *both* type-safe and memory-safe with no GC; `unsafe` is an explicit, auditable region where *you* uphold the invariants the compiler can't. The boundary between the two is a deliberate engineering artifact.

Treat them as two dials you set per component, and never let a postmortem blur "we had a type error" with "we corrupted memory" — the fixes differ.

### 4. The Type of a Type: Kinds

Values have types; types have **kinds**. A kind is "the type of a type," and ignoring kinds causes a specific, recurring confusion: trying to use a type constructor where a concrete type is needed.

- `int`, `bool`, `String`, `User` have kind `*` — they classify *values* directly; they are "fully applied" concrete types.
- `List`, `Option`, `Vec`, `Array` have kind `* → *` — they are **type constructors**: give them a type and they produce a type. `List` alone is not a type; `List<Int>` is. `List : * → *`, `List<Int> : *`.
- `Map`, `Either`, `Result` have kind `* → * → *` — two type arguments to produce a concrete type.
- **Higher-kinded types** abstract over constructors: `Functor f` quantifies over `f : * → *`. This is what lets you write "map over *any* container" once. Languages differ sharply: Haskell and Scala have HKTs; Java, Go, Rust (mostly), and TypeScript don't, which is why "a generic `Monad` interface" is awkward or impossible in them.

The practical payoff: when a compiler says "expected a type, found a type constructor" or "`List` is not applied to enough arguments," you're hitting a *kind* error — a type-of-types mismatch. And when you wish you could write one abstraction over "any container `F`," you're wishing for higher kinds your language may not have.

### 5. Phantom Types: Compile-Time State With No Runtime Cost

A **phantom type** is a type parameter that appears in the *type* but not in the *representation* — pure compile-time bookkeeping. It's the professional's tool for encoding state machines, units, and permissions into types at zero runtime cost:

- `Temperature<Celsius>` vs `Temperature<Fahrenheit>` — both are a single `f64` at run time, but the compiler refuses to add them. The Mars Climate Orbiter was lost to a unit mismatch; phantom types make that a compile error.
- `Connection<Open>` vs `Connection<Closed>` — `send()` only exists on `Connection<Open>`; you *cannot* call it on a closed connection, and the state is tracked entirely in the type with no extra byte stored.
- `Request<Unvalidated>` vs `Request<Validated>` — a handler that requires `Request<Validated>` can never receive unvalidated input, because the only way to get a `Validated` is to pass through the validator.

This is "make illegal states unrepresentable" realized with phantom types: the illegal transition isn't checked at run time — it *doesn't typecheck*.

### 6. Types as the Cheapest Tests

The unifying professional thesis. Compare the cost and coverage of three ways to enforce a property "this list is never empty":

| Mechanism | When it checks | Coverage | Cost |
|-----------|----------------|----------|------|
| Runtime assertion | every execution, every call site | only paths actually run | runtime cost + crashes in prod |
| Unit test | once, in CI | only the examples you wrote | engineer time per case |
| **Type** (`NonEmptyList`) | once, at compile time | **every value, every call site, all inputs** | declare the type once |

A type is a test that:

- is written **once** (declare `NonEmptyList`),
- runs at **compile time** (no runtime cost, no production crash),
- covers **every** input and **every** call site (not just examples), and
- **can't be skipped** (you can't merge code that violates it).

This is why "make illegal states unrepresentable" is an incident-reduction strategy, not an aesthetic preference. Every invariant you lift into a type is a bug class you delete *permanently*, for the whole team, with no ongoing maintenance — strictly dominating the equivalent runtime check or test suite for that property. The art is knowing *which* invariants are worth the modeling effort (the high-frequency, high-cost ones) versus which are cheaper to assert at run time.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Real-world thing |
|---------|------------------|
| **Type vs representation** | A "designated parking spot" sign (logical) vs the painted rectangle of asphalt (physical). Same car fits; the sign adds meaning, not material. |
| **Newtype, zero cost** | Two identical keys cut the same, but stamped "FRONT" and "BACK" — indistinguishable metal, distinct *meaning* you can't mix up. |
| **Niche-filling** | Using the one empty mailbox slot to also mean "resident moved out" — no new mailbox needed; an unused state carries extra info. |
| **Type vs memory safety** | Type safety = "you used the right tool for the job." Memory safety = "you stayed inside the workshop and didn't reach into the machinery." Different rules, different injuries. |
| **Kinds (type of a type)** | A recipe *template* ("a pie of X") vs a finished recipe ("apple pie"). `Pie` is a template (`* → *`); `ApplePie` is concrete (`*`). |
| **Phantom type** | A wristband color at an event: doesn't change who you are, but the gate enforces "red bands only past this point." |
| **Types as cheapest tests** | A door frame that physically can't admit oversized furniture — no inspector, no checklist, no incident; the geometry enforces it for every item, forever. |

---

## Mental Models

### The "Two Identities" Model

Every type has a **logical identity** (meaning + operations, what you reason with) and a **physical identity** (bytes + layout, what it costs). Senior work lives in the gap: maximize logical distinctions (safety) while minimizing physical cost (newtypes, phantom types, niches that erase to nothing). When you propose a type, state both: "logically a validated email, physically just a `String` — zero overhead."

### The "Two Dials" Model

Type safety and memory safety are **separate dials** you set per component. Don't ask "is this safe?" — ask "is this *type*-safe?" and "is this *memory*-safe?" separately, because the failure modes and fixes differ. A type-confusion CVE and an off-by-one are different bugs even when one causes the other. Rust's `unsafe` is literally a knob that lowers the memory-safety dial in a scoped region while keeping type safety.

### The "Kind Ladder" Model

There's a ladder: **values** are classified by **types**, which are classified by **kinds**. `42 : Int : *`. `[1,2] : List<Int>`, where `List : * → *`. When the compiler complains about an unapplied `List` or a "type constructor where a type is expected," you've stepped on the wrong rung. When you wish to abstract over "any `F` that's a container," you want to quantify one rung up — higher-kinded types.

### The "Test That Can't Be Skipped" Model

Reframe every type decision as a test-design decision. A `string` parameter is a test with *zero* assertions — it asserts nothing about the content. A `NonEmptyList<EmailAddress>` parameter is a *battery* of tests (non-empty, all valid emails) that runs on every value at every call, can't be forgotten, and costs no runtime. Ask of every boundary: "what is the cheapest type that makes the bad input not typecheck?"

---

## Code Examples

### Newtype: maximal type distinction, zero runtime cost (Rust)

```rust
// Logically distinct, physically identical (both are u64), zero overhead.
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct UserId(u64);
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct OrderId(u64);

fn cancel(order: OrderId) { /* ... */ }

fn main() {
    let u = UserId(7);
    let o = OrderId(7);
    cancel(o);          // ok
    // cancel(u);       // COMPILE ERROR: expected OrderId, found UserId
    // ...even though both are 8 bytes holding 7. The distinction is compile-time only.
    assert_eq!(std::mem::size_of::<UserId>(), 8); // no wrapper cost
}
```

### Type vs representation: layout depends on field order

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;

struct Bad { a: u8, b: u64, c: u8 }   // padding around the u64
struct Good { b: u64, a: u8, c: u8 }  // packed tighter

fn main() {
    println!("{}", size_of::<Bad>());   // 24 on most targets (padding)
    println!("{}", size_of::<Good>());  // 16 — same logical content, smaller layout
}
```

### Niche-filling: `Option<&T>` is free

```rust
use std::mem::size_of;
fn main() {
    // Option adds a logical "None" case, but the null pointer (invalid for &T)
    // is reused, so the representation does not grow.
    println!("{}", size_of::<&i32>());          // 8
    println!("{}", size_of::<Option<&i32>>());  // 8 — niche-filled, not 16
}
```

### Type safety without memory safety: type punning in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float f = 3.1415927f;
    // Reinterpret the bytes under a different type — legal in C via union/pointer tricks,
    // a TYPE violation that is also a memory-level reinterpretation.
    unsigned int bits = *(unsigned int*)&f;   // type punning
    printf("%#010x\n", bits);                 // 0x40490fdb
    // One step further is genuinely unsafe:
    // int *p = (int*)0xdeadbeef; *p = 1;     // type-"valid" cast, memory-UNSAFE write
    return 0;
}
```

C lets you reinterpret bytes (lose type discipline) and dereference arbitrary addresses (lose memory safety) — two separate failures the language doesn't stop.

### Kinds: a type constructor is not a type (Haskell)

```haskell
-- Int      :: *          (a concrete type — classifies values)
-- Maybe    :: * -> *     (a type CONSTRUCTOR — needs an argument)
-- Maybe Int:: *          (now concrete)
-- Either   :: * -> * -> *

-- Higher-kinded abstraction: works for ANY container f :: * -> *
class MyFunctor f where
  fmap' :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b   -- f is quantified at kind * -> *

instance MyFunctor Maybe where
  fmap' _ Nothing  = Nothing
  fmap' g (Just x) = Just (g x)
```

`f` ranges over *type constructors*, one rung up the kind ladder — exactly the abstraction Java/Go/TS can't express.

### Phantom types: compile-time state machine, zero runtime state (Rust)

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomData;

struct Open;
struct Closed;

struct Connection<State> { fd: i32, _state: PhantomData<State> }

impl Connection<Closed> {
    fn open(fd: i32) -> Connection<Open> {
        Connection { fd, _state: PhantomData }
    }
}
impl Connection<Open> {
    fn send(&self, _data: &[u8]) { /* ... */ }
    fn close(self) -> Connection<Closed> {
        Connection { fd: self.fd, _state: PhantomData }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = Connection::<Closed>::open(3);
    c.send(b"hi");          // ok — c is Connection<Open>
    let c = c.close();
    // c.send(b"late");     // COMPILE ERROR: send() doesn't exist on Connection<Closed>
}
// `State` is never stored — PhantomData is zero-sized. The state machine is purely in types.
```

### Types as the cheapest test: validation as construction (TypeScript)

```typescript
// A branded type: a string that PROVES it passed validation.
type Email = string & { readonly __brand: "Email" };

function parseEmail(raw: string): Email | null {
  return /^[^@]+@[^@]+$/.test(raw) ? (raw as Email) : null;
}

function sendWelcome(to: Email) { /* never re-validates; the type guarantees it */ }

const e = parseEmail(userInput);
if (e) sendWelcome(e);       // ok
// sendWelcome(userInput);   // COMPILE ERROR: string is not Email
// One declaration replaces a re-validation at every call site, for every input.
```

## Pros & Cons

| Decision | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Newtypes / branded types** | Type safety at zero runtime cost; prevents ID/unit mix-ups. | Boilerplate (wrapping/unwrapping, trait derivation). |
| **Refined / phantom types** | Encode state, units, permissions; illegal transitions don't compile. | Steeper learning curve; error messages get hairier. |
| **Aggressive layout control** | Smaller, cache-friendlier, faster. | Fragile across ABIs/targets; can hurt readability. |
| **Monomorphized generics** | No indirection; full inlining and speed. | Code bloat, longer compile times. |
| **Erased/boxed generics** | One copy, fast compile, dynamic dispatch flexibility. | Pointer indirection; no runtime type info (erasure). |
| **Higher-kinded abstraction** | Write once over any container/effect. | Only some languages support it; high abstraction cost. |
| **Types-as-tests** | Bug classes deleted permanently, no runtime cost, full coverage. | Over-modeling cheap invariants wastes effort; not every property is type-expressible. |

---

## Use Cases

- **Newtypes/branded types** wherever IDs, units, or validation states are mixed: payments, multi-tenant systems, physical-unit math, anything with multiple `string` or `u64` concepts that must not cross.
- **Phantom/typestate** for protocol state machines (connections, sessions, builders), permission tiers (admin vs user tokens), and validated-vs-raw input boundaries.
- **Layout control** in hot paths, serialization formats, FFI/ABI boundaries, and memory-constrained or cache-sensitive systems.
- **Memory-vs-type-safety reasoning** when integrating native code, writing `unsafe`/FFI, sandboxing untrusted plugins, or doing security review.
- **Kinds/HKTs** when designing generic libraries (parsers, effect systems, container abstractions) in languages that support them; knowing the *absence* of HKTs explains library shape in those that don't.
- **Types-as-tests** as a standing strategy: in every postmortem, ask "could a type have made this unrepresentable?" and convert recurring incident classes into compile errors.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Parse, don't validate

Convert unstructured input into a *type that proves validity* at the boundary, once. Downstream code takes the validated type and never re-checks. `parseEmail: string -> Email | null` beats `isValidEmail: string -> bool` because the result *carries the evidence*. (This is the engineering name for construction-as-proof.)

### Pattern 2: Newtype every ID and unit

Never pass two semantically different `u64`s or `string`s with the same raw type. Wrap each (`UserId`, `OrderId`, `Cents`, `Meters`). The compiler then catches every transposition — a bug class that's otherwise invisible and routinely ships.

### Pattern 3: Typestate for protocols

Model each state of a stateful object as a distinct type (`Builder<Incomplete>` → `Builder<Ready>`; `File<Open>` → `File<Closed>`). Make state-illegal operations *not exist* on the wrong-state type. The state machine becomes uncheckable-at-runtime because it's enforced at compile time.

### Pattern 4: Decouple logical type from representation explicitly

When performance demands a tight layout, keep the *logical* type clean and confine the representation trick (packing, niche, union) behind a small, well-documented module with the invariant stated. Don't let layout leak into business logic.

### Pattern 5: Box the large variant

When a sum type has one huge variant, the whole enum pays for it on every value. Box the large case (`enum E { Small(u8), Big(Box<[u8;1024]>) }`) so the common path stays small. A type-and-representation co-design.

---

## Best Practices

- **State logical and physical identity separately in design docs.** "Logically a validated, non-empty UTF-8 path; physically a `String` — no overhead." This pre-empts the "won't that be slow?" objection.
- **Keep type safety and memory safety as separate review checklist items.** Don't let a postmortem conflate them; the root causes and remediations differ.
- **Scope and audit every `unsafe`/FFI/cast.** That's where both dials can drop. Comment the invariant *you* are now responsible for that the compiler no longer checks.
- **Reach for phantom/typestate when a runtime state check recurs.** If you keep asserting "connection must be open," lift it into the type.
- **Don't over-model.** Not every invariant deserves a type. Reserve the heavy machinery (phantom types, typestate, refined types) for high-frequency, high-cost invariants. A runtime check is fine for the long tail.
- **Mind generic instantiation strategy at scale.** Monomorphization bloat can dominate binary size and compile time; erasure costs indirection. Choose per hot path, not by reflex.
- **Watch struct layout in hot or large data.** Field ordering, padding, and variant sizes are real performance and memory levers — measure with `size_of`/`offsetof` and a profiler.
- **In every incident review, ask the type question.** "Could this state have been unrepresentable?" Turn recurring incident classes into compile errors; that's the highest-ROI use of types in production.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Newtypes can leak their inner type.** If you expose the wrapped value freely (auto-deref, public field), you lose the protection — code starts mixing `UserId` and `OrderId` via their raw `u64`. Keep the wrapper opaque.
- **Layout is not guaranteed unless you ask.** Default struct layout can be reordered by the compiler (Rust) or fixed by declaration (C). Don't assume field order maps to byte order unless you specify `repr(C)`/`#pragma pack`/equivalent — critical at FFI/serialization boundaries.
- **Phantom-typed state doesn't survive serialization.** Write `Connection<Open>` to disk and read it back, and the phantom state is gone — it was never represented. Re-establish invariants on deserialization.
- **Erasure removes runtime type info you might want.** Java generics, TypeScript types: you can't reflect on them at run time. Designs that need runtime type identity must carry a discriminant explicitly.
- **Type punning is undefined behavior in many languages.** C/C++ strict-aliasing rules mean `*(int*)&float_var` may be UB; the "it works" can vanish under optimization. Use the language's sanctioned mechanism (`memcpy`, `std::bit_cast`, `transmute` with care).
- **Higher-kinded wishes hit hard walls.** In Java/Go/Rust/TS, "an interface for any monad" is awkward or impossible. Don't design an API assuming HKTs your language lacks; you'll end up with macros, codegen, or duplication.
- **A type proves nothing about data you didn't construct through it.** Deserialization, FFI, `unsafe`, and casts can fabricate a "valid" value that never passed the constructor. The guarantee is only as strong as the constructor monopoly.

---

## Tricky Points

- **Zero-cost abstraction is a representation claim, not a logical one.** "Zero-cost" means the *physical* representation and dispatch are as good as hand-written; the *logical* distinctions (newtype, phantom) add safety the compiler erases. When someone says "newtypes are free," they mean physically free, infinitely valuable logically.
- **Type confusion is the bridge from type-unsafety to memory-unsafety.** Most VM/browser RCE exploits begin as a type confusion (the engine believes an object is type `A`, it's type `B`) that yields a memory-corruption primitive. This is precisely why type safety is a *security* property, not just a correctness one.
- **Kinds are where Java/Go/Rust hit their ceiling.** The lack of higher-kinded types is *the* reason these languages can't express a generic `Functor`/`Monad`/`Traversable` cleanly, and why their effect/async/collection abstractions look the way they do. Recognizing a "missing HKT" explains a lot of library design.
- **A sum type's runtime size is dominated by its worst variant.** This couples logical design (how many/what variants) to representation cost in a way newcomers miss; one fat variant taxes every value. Boxing decouples them.
- **"Make illegal states unrepresentable" has a representation cost ceiling.** Encoding an invariant in a type is free when it erases (phantom, newtype) and *not* free when it changes representation (adding a discriminant, an extra field). The strategy is cheapest exactly when the distinction is compile-time only.

## War Stories

**The transposed IDs.** A service passed `(userId, orgId)` — both `int64` — into a permissions check whose signature was `check(int64, int64)`. A refactor swapped the argument order at one call site. It compiled, passed the existing tests (which happened to use equal IDs), and shipped a privilege-escalation bug. Fix: newtype `UserId`/`OrgId`. The transposition became a compile error; the bug class was deleted for every call site at once, at zero runtime cost.

**The unit that crashed a spacecraft.** The Mars Climate Orbiter was lost because one module produced pound-force-seconds and another consumed newton-seconds — both bare floating-point numbers. A phantom-typed `Impulse<Imperial>` vs `Impulse<Metric>` would have made the mismatched handoff fail to compile. The numbers were right; the *types* were missing.

**The type confusion that became an RCE.** A scripting-engine optimization assumed an object's shape (its hidden-class type) was stable across a callback; an attacker mutated it mid-operation, so the engine read one type's field layout over another type's bytes — a textbook type confusion that handed the attacker an out-of-bounds read/write. The lesson the team took: type safety is a *memory-safety and security* boundary, and "the JIT trusts this type" is a load-bearing assumption that must hold under adversarial input.

**The enum that ate the cache.** A hot event struct was a sum type whose rare variant carried a 1 KB inline buffer. Every event — 99% of them the tiny common variant — occupied 1 KB, blowing the L1/L2 cache and tanking throughput. Boxing the rare variant dropped the common case to 16 bytes and tripled throughput. Same logical type; a representation co-design fixed it.

## Test Yourself

1. Explain why `UserId(u64)` and `OrderId(u64)` are logically distinct but physically identical, and what "zero-cost" means precisely here.
2. Reorder `struct { a: u8; b: u64; c: u8 }` to shrink it, and explain why the size changes though the content doesn't.
3. Define type safety and memory safety separately. Give a bug that violates one but not the other, in each direction.
4. Why does a type confusion in a VM/JIT so often escalate to memory corruption? What does this imply about type safety as a security property?
5. Give the kinds of `Int`, `List`, `Either`, and a `Functor`'s parameter `f`. Why can't Java/Go express the last one?
6. How does a phantom type encode "this connection is open" with zero runtime storage? What happens to that guarantee across serialization?
7. Compare a `NonEmptyList` type, a unit test, and a runtime assertion as ways to enforce non-emptiness — on *when* they check, *what* they cover, and *what* they cost.
8. When is "make illegal states unrepresentable" free, and when does it cost representation? Tie your answer to discriminants and niche-filling.

## Summary

- A type has a **logical identity** (meaning + operations) and a **physical representation** (bytes + layout). Senior engineering exploits the gap: **newtypes** and **phantom types** add safety the compiler *erases* — distinct types, identical bytes, zero runtime cost — while **niche-filling** and **field ordering** turn type choices into real size/cache wins.
- A type is the compiler's **layout contract**: field order drives padding and size, sum types cost a discriminant plus their largest variant, and generics force a representation strategy (monomorphization vs erasure/boxing).
- **Type safety and memory safety are separate dials.** Type safety = right operation on right type; memory safety = no OOB/use-after-free. They're independent, but **type confusion is the classic bridge to memory corruption** — making type safety a *security* property. Audit every `unsafe`/FFI/cast where the dials drop.
- Types have **kinds** — the type of a type. `Int : *`, `List : * → *`, `Either : * → * → *`. **Higher-kinded types** abstract over constructors (`Functor f`); their absence in Java/Go/Rust/TS explains those languages' library shapes.
- **Phantom types** encode state, units, and permissions purely in the type system with zero runtime storage, making illegal transitions fail to *compile* — but the guarantee evaporates across serialization.
- **Types are the cheapest tests:** written once, checked at compile time, covering *every* input and call site, impossible to skip, at no runtime cost. "Make illegal states unrepresentable" is therefore an **incident-reduction strategy** — free when the distinction erases, modestly costly when it adds representation. In every postmortem, ask whether a type could have made the failure unrepresentable.
