## Introduction

> Focus: **Move from "don't do `a[i] = i++`" to "here is the exact rule that makes it undefined, and how the rule changed between C89, C99, and C++11/17."**

At the junior level the advice was a heuristic: *don't read and write the same variable in one expression.* At the middle level we replace the heuristic with the actual rule. There are two historical formalisms, and a competent engineer should be able to switch between them:

1. **Sequence points** — the C model (C89/C99/C11) and pre-C++11 C++. A sequence point is a position in the program where *all side effects of prior evaluations have completed and no side effects of subsequent evaluations have started*. The rule: between two sequence points, an object's stored value may be modified **at most once**, and any read of that object must be for the purpose of computing the value to store.

2. **Sequenced-before** — the C++11 model that replaced sequence points with a finer relation. Two evaluations are either *sequenced-before* one another (ordered), *unsequenced* (no order, and writes may not race), or *indeterminately-sequenced* (one before the other, but you don't know which — used for function calls).

Understanding both lets you answer, precisely and from first principles, *why* a given expression is undefined, unspecified, or perfectly fine — and how that answer shifts across C89, C99, C11, C++11, and C++17.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at this level:** Once you maintain real C or C++ codebases, "it's undefined, don't" stops being enough. You need to read a tricky expression, point to the exact missing sequencing edge, and explain to a reviewer whether the compiler is allowed to do what it just did. That requires the formal vocabulary below.

This page covers: sequence points in detail, the C++11 sequenced-before trichotomy, *why* unsequenced read+write is UB, the special cases that *are* sequence points (`&&`, `||`, `?:`, comma, function-call entry), the unspecified (not undefined) order of function arguments, the GCC-vs-MSVC right-to-left reality, what C++17 fixed, and how `i = i++` differs between C (UB) and Java (defined). The deepest connections — to the memory model, the as-if rule, and the optimizer — are in `senior.md` and `professional.md`.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Comfort with C or C++ syntax, including `i++`, pointers, and array indexing.
- **Required:** The junior-level distinction between *precedence* (grouping) and *evaluation order* (timing).
- **Required:** What a side effect is, and what undefined vs unspecified behavior mean informally.
- **Helpful:** Having been bitten by an `i++` bug at least once.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to multiple compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) so the "different compilers, different order" point lands concretely.

You do **not** yet need: the C++ memory model's *sequenced-before / happens-before* extension to threads (that's `senior.md`), or the optimizer's as-if rule in full (`professional.md`).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Sequence point** | (C model) A point where all prior side effects are complete and no subsequent ones have begun. |
| **Sequenced-before** | (C++11) Evaluation A is sequenced-before B: A's value computation and side effects complete before B starts. |
| **Unsequenced** | (C++11) No ordering between A and B; if both touch the same scalar and one writes, it's UB. |
| **Indeterminately-sequenced** | (C++11) A is before B *or* B is before A, but which is unspecified. Used for argument and `<<` chains pre-C++17. |
| **Value computation** | Working out the value an expression denotes (e.g., reading `i` to get its current value). |
| **Side effect** | Modifying an object, reading a `volatile`, performing I/O, or other observable change. |
| **Full expression** | The outermost expression not part of another, e.g. the whole controlling expression of an `if`. Sequence points bracket full expressions. |
| **Unspecified behavior** | The standard offers a set of allowed behaviors and the implementation picks one (e.g. argument order). Not erroneous. |
| **Undefined behavior (UB)** | The standard imposes *no* requirements. The program is meaningless; optimizers assume it can't happen. |
| **Scalar object** | A single value object (int, pointer, float...). The "modify once between sequence points" rule applies per scalar. |
| **Lvalue-to-rvalue conversion** | Reading the stored value of an object — the "read" in "read and write the same object." |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The sequence-point rule (C89 / C99 / C11)

The classic C rule, almost verbatim:

> Between the previous and next sequence point, an object shall have its stored value modified **at most once** by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read **only to determine the value to be stored**.

Two violations make a program undefined:

- **Modifying a scalar twice** between sequence points: `i = i++;`, `i++ + i++`, `++i + ++i`.
- **Reading a scalar for any purpose other than computing the value to store**, while also writing it: `a[i] = i++` (the read of `i` to index `a` is *not* "to determine the value stored into `i`").

Where are the sequence points in C? The important ones:

- At the **end of a full expression** (the `;` of a statement, the controlling expression of `if`/`while`/`for`, each clause of `for(;;)`).
- After the **left operand of `&&`, `||`, `?:`, and the comma operator `,`**.
- After **evaluating all function arguments and the function designator, but before the call** (entry to a function is a sequence point).
- At the `?` of the ternary and between the `?:` selected branch.

Everything *not* separated by a sequence point is, in old C terms, "indeterminately ordered" with no guarantee of single-modification — hence the traps.

### 2. The C++11 model: sequenced-before, unsequenced, indeterminately-sequenced

C++11 retired "sequence points" (they were too coarse to describe threads and finer optimizations) and replaced them with a *relation between evaluations*. For any two evaluations A and B, exactly one of:

- **A is sequenced-before B** — A fully completes (value computation *and* side effects) before B begins. Total order. Example: the left operand of `&&` is sequenced-before the right.
- **A and B are unsequenced** — no ordering at all, and they may even interleave. If both access the same scalar and at least one is a write (and they're not atomic), the behavior is **undefined**. Example (pre-C++17): the two `i++` in `f(i++, i++)`.
- **A and B are indeterminately-sequenced** — one is sequenced-before the other, but *which* is unspecified, and they do **not** interleave. Example: two full function-argument evaluations — each runs to completion, but in an unspecified order. This is *not* UB by itself (no overlap), it's merely *unspecified*.

The crucial split: **unsequenced** (overlap allowed → UB on conflicting access) vs **indeterminately-sequenced** (no overlap, just unknown order → merely unspecified). Function *arguments* are indeterminately-sequenced relative to each other; sub-expressions *within* an argument can be unsequenced.

### 3. Why `a[i] = i++` is undefined — traced precisely

```c
a[i] = i++;
```

There are two side effects / reads on `i` in one full expression with no sequence point (C) / sequenced-before edge (C++) between them:

- **Read of `i`** to compute the address `&a[i]` (left side).
- **Write of `i`** as part of `i++` (right side).

In the C model: between the surrounding sequence points, `i` is read *not* "to determine the value to be stored into `i`" (it's read to index `a`) while `i` is also modified → **UB**. In the C++ pre-17 model: the value computation of `a[i]`'s index and the side effect of `i++` are **unsequenced**, and they conflict on the scalar `i` → **UB**. Same verdict, two derivations.

> **The fix is mechanical:** introduce sequencing. `a[i] = i; i++;` puts a sequence point (the `;`) between the read and the write.

### 4. Assignment ordering and what C++17 changed

C++17 tightened several previously-unspecified or undefined cases. The most important:

- In an assignment `E1 = E2`, C++17 now sequences **E2 before E1** (the right-hand side is evaluated before the left-hand side's value computation, and the assignment's side effect is sequenced after both). Before C++17 the order of `E1` and `E2` was unsequenced — so `a[i] = i++` was UB. **In C++17, `a[i] = i++` becomes well-defined** (it uses the *old* `i` to index). C remains UB. This is a genuine, testable difference between C, C++14, and C++17.
- C++17 also made the operands of `<<`, `>>`, `[]`, `.`, `->*`, and several others *sequenced* left-to-right, fixing the infamous `std::cout << f() << g()` argument-order surprise.
- **Function arguments remain indeterminately-sequenced even in C++17** — argument order is *still* unspecified. C++17 did not fix `printf("%d %d", i++, i++)` argument order; that's still unspecified (and the conflicting writes are still UB because the two `i++` are unsequenced relative to each other).

So the era matters. Always know which standard you compile against.

### 5. Function-argument order is *unspecified*, and compilers really do differ

The standard never promised an order for evaluating function arguments. Historically:

- **GCC and Clang on x86-64** typically evaluate arguments **right-to-left** (matching the System V calling convention's push order, conceptually).
- **MSVC** has also commonly evaluated **right-to-left** for cdecl, but the standard does not require *any* order and you must not depend on it.
- Older toolchains and different ABIs flip this. The lesson is identical regardless of the exact direction: **never write code whose meaning depends on argument order.**

This is *unspecified* (the compiler picks one of several legal orders), which is much milder than the *undefined* status of `f(i++, i++)` — there, on top of the unspecified order, the two writes to `i` are unsequenced and conflict, pushing it from "unspecified result" all the way to "no defined meaning."

### 6. The guaranteed sequence points you rely on

These always impose order, in C and C++:

| Construct | Guarantee |
|-----------|-----------|
| `a && b` | `a` sequenced-before `b`; `b` skipped if `a` is false. |
| `a \|\| b` | `a` sequenced-before `b`; `b` skipped if `a` is true. |
| `c ? a : b` | `c` sequenced-before the selected branch; only one branch runs. |
| `a , b` (comma op) | `a` sequenced-before `b`; value is `b`. |
| End of full expression `;` | All side effects complete here. |
| Function entry | All arguments evaluated (in some order) before the body runs. |

These are your tools for *forcing* order when you need it.

## Real-World Analogies

**The assembly line with inspection gates.** A sequence point is a quality-control gate on a conveyor belt: nothing past the gate may start until everything before it has finished and settled. Between two gates, parts can be assembled in any order — so if two workers both try to stamp the *same* part between gates, with no rule about who goes first, you get a defective part. That defective part is undefined behavior.

**Two couriers, one unknown dispatch order (indeterminately-sequenced).** Function arguments are like two couriers who must *each* finish their entire delivery before the meeting starts, but the dispatcher won't tell you which courier left first. There's no chaos (they don't collide mid-route — no interleaving), you just can't predict the order. That's "indeterminately-sequenced," and it's merely *unspecified*, not undefined.

**Two painters on one wall at once (unsequenced).** `f(i++, i++)`'s two increments are like two painters told to repaint the *same* square inch simultaneously with no turn-taking. Their brushstrokes can interleave. The result is meaningless — undefined.

---

## Mental Models

### Model 1: The trichotomy ladder

```
sequenced-before        → fully ordered, safe              (e.g. left of &&)
indeterminately-seq.    → ordered but unknown which, no overlap → UNSPECIFIED  (args)
unsequenced             → may overlap; conflict on a scalar → UNDEFINED        (f(i++,i++))
```

Climb the ladder when classifying any expression: is the pair sequenced, indeterminate, or unsequenced? That single classification tells you safe / unspecified / undefined.

### Model 2: "Find the missing edge"

To judge an expression in C/C++, list every read and write of each scalar, then ask: *for each conflicting pair (one is a write), is there a sequenced-before edge between them?* If yes → fine. If they're indeterminately-sequenced → unspecified order but no UB *unless* they conflict (then still UB via the conflict). If unsequenced and conflicting → UB. The whole analysis is "is there an ordering edge between these two touches of the same object?"

### Model 3: Era-aware reasoning

```
Expression: a[i] = i++;
  C (any)     → UB
  C++14       → UB
  C++17+      → defined (RHS sequenced before LHS), uses old i
```

Always pin the *standard version* before declaring an answer. The same source has different verdicts across eras.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1 — Classifying expressions by the rule

```c
int i = 0, a[5];

i = i + 1;        // fine: read of i is to compute value stored into i
i = i++;          // UB in C/C++14: i modified twice (= and ++) with no sequencing
a[i] = i++;       // UB in C/C++14 (defined in C++17): read of i (index) conflicts with write
i++ + i++;        // UB: two unsequenced modifications of i
f(i++, i++);      // UB: arguments' i++ are unsequenced relative to each other
i++ , i++;        // OK: the comma operator sequences left-before-right
```

### Example 2 — The comma operator imposes order

```c
int x = (a = 5, a + 1);   // a = 5 sequenced-before a+1; x becomes 6. Defined.
```

Contrast with the *comma separator* in a function call — `f(a, b)` — which is **not** the comma operator and imposes **no** order between `a` and `b`.

### Example 3 — Short-circuit forces sequencing

```c
// p is read for the null check, sequenced-before reading p->len. Safe.
if (p != NULL && p->len > 0) { ... }

// Force evaluation order with comma when you genuinely need a side effect first:
int ok = (init(), ready());   // init() runs, result discarded, then ready() decides.
```

### Example 4 — Demonstrating unspecified argument order

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int log_and_return(int id) { printf("arg %d\n", id); return id; }

int main(void) {
    // The two arg evaluations are indeterminately-sequenced: order unspecified.
    printf("sum=%d\n", log_and_return(1) + log_and_return(2));
    // GCC/Clang on x86-64 often print "arg 2" then "arg 1" (right-to-left).
}
```

The *sum* is always `3`; the print order is implementation-defined. Don't ship code that depends on it.

### Example 5 — `i = i++` differs by language

```c
// C / C++14: UNDEFINED. Anything may happen.
int i = 0; i = i++;
```

```java
// Java: DEFINED. i ends up 0.
// Evaluation: read i (0) for the assignment's RHS value; i++ writes 1 to i;
// then the assignment stores the saved RHS (0) back into i, overwriting the 1.
int i = 0; i = i++;   // i == 0 afterward
```

Same characters, different worlds: C says "no meaning," Java says "definitely 0." This is the cleanest illustration of why pinning order (Java) versus leaving it loose (C) is a real semantic decision.

### Example 6 — Member-initialization order (C++ teaser)

```cpp
struct S {
    int a;
    int b;
    // Initializer list says b first, then a — but members initialize in
    // DECLARATION order (a then b), not init-list order. If a depends on b, bug.
    S(int x) : b(x), a(b + 1) {}   // a is initialized FIRST (declaration order), reading uninitialized b!
};
```

This declaration-order-not-init-list-order rule is a classic C++ trap; `senior.md` covers it and static-init order in full.

## Pros & Cons

| | Pros | Cons |
|---|------|------|
| **Sequence-point model (C)** | Simple to state; one rule covers the common traps. | Too coarse for threads and fine-grained optimization; can't express partial overlap. |
| **Sequenced-before model (C++11)** | Precise; distinguishes unspecified from undefined; extends cleanly to the thread memory model. | Heavier vocabulary; you must track which standard era you're in. |
| **Unspecified arg order** | Lets compilers schedule argument evaluation for the target ABI. | Non-portable behavior; pairs with unsequenced writes to produce UB. |

---

## Use Cases

- **Auditing legacy C for `i++` traps:** apply the sequence-point rule mechanically to flag UB before a compiler upgrade exposes it.
- **Porting C to C++17:** some previously-UB assignments become defined; know which so you neither rely on nor fear the change incorrectly.
- **Cross-compiler bug triage:** when a test passes on GCC but fails on MSVC, suspect unspecified argument order first.
- **Writing portable expression macros:** macros that expand arguments multiple times (`#define SQ(x) ((x)*(x))`) combined with `SQ(i++)` produce UB — the sequence-point rule explains why.
- **Code-review rubric:** "does any full expression read and write the same scalar without sequencing?" becomes a concrete checklist item.

---

## Coding Patterns

**Pattern: Force order with a sequence point when you need it.**

```c
// Need a() before b()? Don't trust argument order; sequence explicitly:
int ra = a();
int rb = b();
use(ra, rb);
```

**Pattern: Beware multiple-expansion macros.**

```c
#define MAX(x, y) ((x) > (y) ? (x) : (y))
int m = MAX(i++, j);   // i++ expands twice on one path -> potential double modification
```

Prefer inline functions or `typeof`-based statement-expression macros that evaluate arguments once.

**Pattern: Split RHS/LHS when indices mutate.**

```c
int idx = i;
i++;
a[idx] = idx;   // unambiguous in every standard
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **State the standard before you state the verdict.** "UB in C++14, defined in C++17" is the correct shape of an answer.
2. **Apply the sequence-point rule as a checklist** when reviewing C: at most one modification per scalar per full expression, reads only to determine the stored value.
3. **Treat argument order as unspecified, always**, regardless of what your current compiler does.
4. **Never expand a side-effecting argument multiple times in a macro.**
5. **Reach for `&&`, `||`, `?:`, and the comma operator** when you genuinely need sequencing inside an expression — they're the standard-blessed ordering tools.
6. **Enable `-Wsequence-point` (GCC) / `-Wunsequenced` (Clang)** and treat them as errors.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **`f(i++, i++)`** — unsequenced writes to `i` → UB in C and C++ (even C++17 does not save this).
- **`cout << i++ << i++`** — before C++17, indeterminately-sequenced and the writes conflict → UB; C++17 sequences the `<<` operands left-to-right, removing the *ordering* surprise, but two unsequenced modifications of `i` within them are *still* a problem — confirm against the exact standard.
- **The comma *separator* vs comma *operator*** — `f(a, b)` separator imposes no order; `(a, b)` operator imposes left-then-right. Same character, opposite guarantees.
- **Function-call entry is a sequence point** — so `g(i++) + h(i++)` does *not* race inside each call, but the two calls are indeterminately-sequenced and the two `i++` conflict → still UB.
- **`volatile` does not buy you ordering between two writes in one expression** — it controls when accesses happen relative to the abstract machine, not whether `i = i++` is defined. (More in `professional.md`.)
- **Macros that re-expand arguments** silently turn `SQ(i++)` into UB.

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "C++17 fixed `f(i++, i++)`" | No. Function argument order is *still* unspecified and the conflicting writes are *still* UB. C++17 only sequenced *assignment* RHS-before-LHS and some operators. |
| "Unspecified means undefined" | No. Unspecified = legal-but-unknown choice (arg order). Undefined = no meaning. |
| "Sequence points and sequenced-before are the same" | They model the same idea but sequenced-before is finer and thread-aware. |
| "The comma separator orders arguments" | It does not; only the comma *operator* does. |
| "Member init follows the initializer list" | It follows *declaration* order. |

---

## Cheat Sheet

```
C MODEL (C89/99/11):  "between two sequence points, modify a scalar at most ONCE,
                       and read it only to compute the value being stored."
  Sequence points: end of full expr (;), after left of && || ?: and the comma operator,
                   before a function call (after all args evaluated).

C++11 MODEL (trichotomy):
  sequenced-before        = ordered (safe)             e.g. left of &&
  indeterminately-seq.    = ordered, unknown which     e.g. function arguments  -> UNSPECIFIED
  unsequenced             = may overlap                e.g. f(i++,i++)          -> UB on conflict

C++17 CHANGES:
  E1 = E2          : RHS now sequenced-before LHS  -> a[i]=i++ DEFINED in C++17 (UB in C/C++14)
  << >> [] . ->*   : operands now left-to-right
  function args    : STILL unspecified (NOT fixed)

ALWAYS: &&  ||  ?:  ,(operator)  sequence left-before-right
i = i++ :  C/C++14 = UB ;  Java = defined, stays 0
```

---

## Summary

The middle level replaces the junior heuristic with formal machinery. **C's sequence-point rule** says that between two sequence points a scalar may be modified at most once and read only to compute its new value — which is why `i = i++` and `a[i] = i++` are undefined in C. **C++11's sequenced-before model** refines this into a trichotomy: *sequenced-before* (ordered, safe), *indeterminately-sequenced* (ordered but unknown which, no overlap → merely **unspecified**, e.g. function arguments), and *unsequenced* (may overlap → **undefined** if two accesses conflict, e.g. `f(i++, i++)`). The distinction between unspecified and undefined is load-bearing: argument order is unspecified (GCC/Clang/MSVC genuinely differ, often right-to-left on x86-64), while conflicting unsequenced writes are undefined. **C++17 tightened the rules** — it sequences an assignment's right side before its left (making `a[i] = i++` defined in C++17 though still UB in C and C++14) and orders several operators left-to-right — but it deliberately left function-argument order unspecified. The disciplined engineer always names the standard era before pronouncing a verdict, classifies each conflicting access pair on the sequenced/indeterminate/unsequenced ladder, and forces order with `&&`, `||`, `?:`, or the comma operator when an expression genuinely needs it. The senior level connects this single-thread story to the multi-thread memory model, the static-initialization-order fiasco, and member-initialization order.
