## Introduction

> Focus: **Engineering decisions when you own the bytecode — opcode budget, stack effects, format evolution, deopt, and the safety guarantees that let you run code you didn't write.**

By this level the mechanics are known: stack vs register, dispatch, verification, linking, JIT handoff. The professional question is *design and operation*: if you were responsible for a language runtime, a plugin sandbox, a smart-contract VM, or an embedded scripting engine, **how would you design and evolve the bytecode, and how would you safely run untrusted code on it at scale?**

This page covers five things:

1. **Designing your own bytecode** — the opcode budget (you have 256 single-byte slots; spend them well), stack-effect discipline, encoding regularity, and how to leave room to grow.
2. **WebAssembly as a master class** — a bytecode designed *from scratch* in the 2010s with explicit goals (fast validation, fast JIT, safe sandboxing, language-neutral, compact). Studying *why* it's shaped the way it is teaches every design lesson at once.
3. **Case studies** — the BEAM (concurrency and fault-tolerance as VM design constraints) and CPython internals (a dynamically-typed stack VM, its `.pyc` caching, and its slow march toward specialization and a JIT).
4. **Format evolution** — bytecode outlives hardware and language versions. How do you version, migrate, and maintain compatibility for decades? (Why JVM bytecode from 1997 still runs.)
5. **Security at scale** — running *untrusted* bytecode (blockchain contracts, edge functions, browser code, plugin marketplaces): the threat model, the guarantees you need, gas/fuel metering, and where it goes wrong.

In one sentence: **this page is the architect's view — owning a bytecode as a long-lived, safe, evolvable platform.**

> 🎓 **Why this matters at this level:** Plenty of senior engineers will, at some point, design a small VM — for a rules engine, a query/expression evaluator, a game-scripting layer, an edge-compute sandbox, or a smart-contract platform. The difference between a toy that paints you into a corner and a format that survives ten years of growth is the set of decisions on this page. And running untrusted code is now mainstream (Wasm at the edge, plugins everywhere), so the security model is no longer academic.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** `junior.md`, `middle.md`, `senior.md` — the full mechanics, including dispatch, verification, lazy linking, and the JIT handoff.
- **Required:** Experience reading at least one real bytecode (JVM, CPython, or Wasm) and a mental model of how a runtime starts, links, and executes.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to sandboxing/threat-modeling, capability-based security, and resource metering.
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with how compilers and runtimes are versioned and shipped (the operational reality of a platform).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Opcode budget** | The fixed number of distinct opcodes a single-byte opcode field allows (256). A scarce design resource. |
| **Prefix / multi-byte opcode** | An escape mechanism (e.g. a reserved byte that means "the *real* opcode follows") to extend past 256. |
| **Stack-effect signature** | The (pops, pushes) contract of an opcode; the verifier and codegen depend on it being fixed. |
| **Linear memory** | Wasm's flat, byte-addressable, bounds-checked sandboxed memory — a resizable `ArrayBuffer`, the only memory a module can touch. |
| **Capability-based safety** | A module can do *only* what it's explicitly given (imported functions, a memory, a table) — no ambient authority. |
| **Trap** | Wasm's safe runtime failure (out-of-bounds, division by zero): aborts cleanly without corrupting the host. |
| **Fuel / gas metering** | Counting executed operations to bound CPU; used to make untrusted code interruptible and billable (EVM gas, BEAM reductions, Wasm fuel). |
| **Reduction** | The BEAM's unit of work; each process runs ~2000 reductions then is preempted — the basis of fair, soft-real-time scheduling. |
| **Deoptimization (deopt)** | Reverting from specialized/compiled code back to a safe generic form when a speculative assumption fails. |
| **AOT vs JIT vs interpret** | Compile bytecode ahead of time, at runtime, or just execute it. Most platforms mix these. |
| **Bytecode evolution** | Versioning the format so new producers and old/new consumers stay compatible over years. |
| **Code cache / `.pyc` / Wasm cache** | Persisted compiled artifacts to avoid recompiling on every start. |
| **Hostcall / import** | A function the VM exposes to the bytecode (syscall analog) — the controlled boundary to the outside world. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Designing your own bytecode: the decisions that matter

If you own the bytecode, every choice is a long-term commitment. The big ones:

**The opcode budget (256 is small).** A single-byte opcode gives 256 codes. That fills up faster than you'd think once you add typed variants, fast-path locals (`LOAD_FAST_0..3`), specialized arithmetic, and superinstructions. Options:
- **Spend codes on frequency.** Give 1-byte opcodes to the hottest operations; relegate rare ones behind a multi-byte prefix. (The JVM dedicates single bytes to `iload_0..3`, `aload_0..3`, etc. precisely because they're so common.)
- **Reserve an escape prefix** (like x86's prefix bytes, or Wasm's multi-byte opcodes) so you can grow past 256 without breaking the format.
- **Reserve a block of opcodes for future use** from day one. You will want them.

**Stack effects are a contract.** Each opcode's (pops, pushes) must be *fixed and documented*. Codegen relies on it to compute `max_stack`; the verifier relies on it to check balance. An opcode whose stack effect depends on runtime state is a verification nightmare — avoid it (or make the variable part an explicit operand, like a call's argument count).

**Encoding regularity vs density.** Fixed-width (Lua-style 32-bit instructions) makes decoding and a future JIT trivial at some space cost. Variable-width (JVM-style) is denser but complicates decode and verification. For a JIT-targeted VM, lean regular. For a ship-it-small transport format, lean dense — but keep it *systematically* dense (don't make every opcode a special case).

**Typed vs untyped opcodes.** Static-typed source → typed opcodes (cheap verification, easy JIT). Dynamic-typed source → untyped opcodes that dispatch on runtime types (CPython), with *adaptive specialization* recovering speed later.

**Leave room for profiling and deopt.** If you ever want a JIT, design now: stable bytecode offsets (so you can hang counters), a place for type feedback, and a *deopt-safe* generic form of every specializable opcode. Retrofitting these is brutal.

**Provide a magic number and an explicit version field.** Non-negotiable for anything persisted. It's the difference between a clean "unsupported version" and undefined behavior on stale or malicious input.

### 2. WebAssembly: a bytecode designed on purpose

Wasm is the most instructive modern case because its constraints were stated up front and the design follows from them.

- **Goal: validate fast (before the download finishes).** ⇒ **Structured control flow** (`block`/`loop`/`if`/`br` to enclosing labels only — no arbitrary gotos) and explicit function/type signatures ⇒ validation is **single-pass, linear-time, total**. No fixpoint, no stack-map games. The validator can stream.
- **Goal: JIT fast and well.** ⇒ a small, regular, statically-typed instruction set that maps cleanly to machine code; an optimizing engine can baseline-compile in one pass and tier up.
- **Goal: safe sandboxing.** ⇒ **linear memory** (one bounds-checked, byte-addressable, isolated `ArrayBuffer`; a module cannot touch host memory, only its own), **no raw pointers to host objects**, and **capability-based** access — a module gets *only* the imports (functions, memory, table) it's explicitly handed. No ambient authority, no syscalls except through hostcalls you provide. Failures are **traps** (clean aborts), not memory corruption.
- **Goal: language-neutral.** ⇒ a low-level target (C/C++/Rust/Go all compile to it) rather than baking in any language's object model.
- **Goal: compact.** ⇒ a binary format with LEB128 varints and a section layout designed for streaming.

The lesson: **Wasm took every hard-won insight from the JVM/CLR era and re-derived the format from explicit non-functional requirements.** Where the JVM's verifier is complex and historically slow (hence stack-map frames), Wasm made validation *cheap by construction*. Where the JVM's control flow is arbitrary gotos that a JIT must reconstruct into a CFG, Wasm hands the structure over directly. Studying *why each Wasm decision was made* is the fastest way to learn bytecode design.

### 3. Case study — the BEAM (Erlang/Elixir)

The BEAM's design constraints are concurrency and fault-tolerance, and they reach all the way into the bytecode/VM:

- **Register-based**, with a generous register set, for interpreter speed without a mandatory JIT (though BeamAsm now JITs).
- **Reduction counting.** Every process is given a budget of ~2000 *reductions* (roughly, function calls/operations); when exhausted, the scheduler preempts it. This makes scheduling **fair and soft-real-time** even with millions of processes and no OS threads per process — a property baked into how the VM counts work as it executes bytecode.
- **No shared mutable memory between processes** ⇒ message passing copies; this shapes the opcodes for sends/receives and lets garbage collection be per-process (tiny, fast, pauseless at the system level).
- **Hot code loading.** The BEAM can load a *new version* of a module while the old one runs, switching callers over at well-defined points — a VM-level feature enabled by symbolic, late-bound calls.

The takeaway: **non-functional requirements (preemptive fairness, isolation, hot upgrade) can be primary drivers of bytecode/VM design**, not afterthoughts.

### 4. Case study — CPython internals

CPython is the canonical *dynamically-typed stack VM*:

- **Untyped opcodes** (`BINARY_OP` dispatches on runtime types) because types aren't known until execution.
- **`.pyc` caching** keyed by source hash/timestamp and interpreter version — avoids re-parsing/re-compiling unchanged modules. The version key is why a 3.11 `.pyc` won't load in 3.12: the *bytecode is not stable across minor versions* (a deliberate choice — CPython freely changes opcodes to optimize).
- **The adaptive specializing interpreter** (PEP 659, 3.11+): generic opcodes observe their operands and *quicken* in place into specialized forms (`BINARY_OP_ADD_INT`, `LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE_VALUE`), each guarded so a type change *deopts* back to the generic opcode. This is runtime superinstruction/specialization — the bridge toward the experimental CPython **JIT** (a copy-and-patch design, 3.13+).
- **The GIL** shapes none of the bytecode directly but everything about execution: one thread runs bytecode at a time, with the interpreter releasing the GIL at instruction boundaries — which is why the *atomicity of individual bytecodes* is part of Python's de-facto memory model.

The takeaway: **a dynamically-typed VM pays for flexibility with dispatch cost, and claws it back with runtime specialization** — exactly the opposite end of the design space from the statically-typed JVM/Wasm.

### 5. Bytecode evolution: building something that lasts decades

JVM bytecode from 1997 still runs on a 2024 JVM. That longevity is engineered:

- **A class-file version field** gates features: a JVM refuses class files newer than it understands, but happily runs old ones. Old bytecode keeps working because old opcodes are *never removed or repurposed* — only added.
- **Additive evolution.** New language features (generics → erased to existing bytecode; lambdas → `invokedynamic`; records, sealed classes) are largely added without breaking the existing instruction set. `invokedynamic` is the standout: a single, deliberately *open-ended* opcode that defers call-site linking to user-supplied bootstrap logic, so the JVM could add lambdas and dynamic-language support *without new opcodes for each*.
- **Contrast: CPython deliberately does NOT keep bytecode stable** across minor versions, trading cross-version portability for the freedom to optimize the bytecode aggressively each release. Two valid philosophies; pick one *on purpose* and tell your users which.
- **The constant pool / metadata as an extension point.** New attributes (`StackMapTable`, `BootstrapMethods`, nest-mates) can be added to class files; old VMs ignore unknown attributes. Designing your format so unknown sections are *skippable* (Wasm custom sections, JVM optional attributes) is what makes additive evolution possible.

The takeaway: **decide your stability promise explicitly, make evolution additive, and design unknown-data to be skippable.**

### 6. Security of running untrusted bytecode at scale

Running code you didn't write — browser JS/Wasm, edge functions, blockchain contracts, plugin marketplaces, database stored procedures — is now mainstream. The threat model and guarantees:

- **Memory safety / isolation.** Untrusted code must not read or write outside its sandbox. Wasm's linear memory + bounds checks, the JVM verifier + no raw pointers, and CLR verification all provide this. *Verification is the gate; bypass it and the sandbox is gone.*
- **Capability confinement.** The code can only call what you hand it (imports/hostcalls). No ambient filesystem, network, or clock unless granted. This is the Wasm/WASI model and the right default.
- **Resource metering (the part people forget).** Memory safety doesn't stop *infinite loops* or memory exhaustion. You need **metering**: EVM **gas** (every opcode costs gas; out of gas → revert), BEAM **reductions** (preempt and reschedule), Wasm **fuel**/epoch interruption (bound CPU, make execution cancellable). Without metering, untrusted code can wedge or DoS the host even while perfectly "safe."
- **Determinism (sometimes required).** Blockchain VMs (EVM) demand *bit-identical* execution across all nodes ⇒ no nondeterministic opcodes (no wall-clock, no float surprises, defined gas for everything). This is a *bytecode-design* constraint: you must exclude or pin down every source of nondeterminism.
- **The verifier/validator is the crown jewel.** It is the security boundary. A verifier bug is a sandbox escape (the JVM has had several historically). Fuzz it relentlessly; keep it small (another argument for Wasm's by-construction-simple validation).

The takeaway: **safe execution of untrusted bytecode = isolation (verified) + confinement (capabilities) + metering (gas/fuel/reductions) + (sometimes) determinism — and the validator must be bulletproof.**

---

## Real-World Analogies

**1. Opcode budget = a 256-character keyboard.** You have 256 keys. Put the letters you type constantly under your fingers (1-byte hot opcodes); banish rare symbols to a chord/shift layer (multi-byte prefix). Waste the home row on rarely-used keys and you'll regret it for the life of the keyboard.

**2. Wasm's capability model = a hotel keycard.** Your card opens *only* your room and the gym — nothing else in the building. The room (linear memory) is yours to trash, but you can't reach the lobby safe or other rooms. The hotel (host) decides exactly which doors your card encodes (imports).

**3. Gas/fuel metering = a taxi meter.** Memory safety is the driver not stealing your wallet; metering is the meter that stops the ride when the fare (your budget) runs out. Without it, an "honest" but runaway trip bills you forever.

**4. Bytecode evolution = building codes that grandfather old buildings.** New code adds requirements for new construction; existing buildings keep their certificate of occupancy. You never retroactively make 1997's bricks illegal — you only add rules for new floors. (`invokedynamic` = a deliberately empty conduit you can run new wiring through later.)

**5. BEAM reductions = a teacher calling on students in turn.** No matter how much one student wants to keep talking, after a fixed number of words the teacher moves on — so 10,000 students each get a fair turn and one loudmouth can't monopolize the room.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: Bytecode is a *platform contract*, not an implementation detail.** Once external producers target it (other compilers, other teams, the public), it's an API you must version and keep promises about. Treat it with the seriousness of a public API.

**Model 2: Non-functional requirements drive the design.** "Validate before download finishes" produced structured control flow. "Fair scheduling of millions of processes" produced reductions. "Identical across nodes" produced determinism constraints. Start from the *required properties*, then derive the format — that's how Wasm and the BEAM were designed.

**Model 3: Safety = isolation + confinement + metering.** Three independent legs. Memory safety alone (isolation) lets untrusted code still DoS you; you need confinement (capabilities) *and* metering (gas/fuel) to be production-safe. Many homegrown "sandboxes" implement one and ship.

**Model 4: Stability is a promise you pick, not a default you discover.** JVM = "old bytecode runs forever" (additive, never remove). CPython = "we'll change bytecode every minor release." Both are fine; an *accidental* policy is the bug.

**Model 5: The validator is the trust boundary; keep it small.** Every line of validator/verifier is attack surface. Wasm's by-design simplicity isn't elegance for its own sake — it shrinks the boundary you must defend.

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Spending an opcode budget (a design sketch)

```
# A 256-slot budget, allocated by frequency (illustrative):
0x00..0x0F   stack/locals fast paths   LOAD_0..3, STORE_0..3, DUP, POP, SWAP, NOP
0x10..0x2F   arithmetic & compare      ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, LT, EQ, ... (typed if static)
0x30..0x3F   control flow              JMP, JMP_IF_FALSE, CALL, RET, ...
0x40..0x5F   superinstructions         LOAD_LOAD_ADD, LOAD_CONST_CALL, ...
0x60..0x7F   reserved for future hot ops   (leave them empty NOW)
0xFE         PREFIX_EXT  → next byte selects from a SECOND 256-op page (rare ops)
0xFF         reserved / trap
```

The point: assign hot ops to single bytes, *reserve a prefix escape and a reserved block* before you ship, and document the stack effect of every opcode.

### Example 2: A trap vs. undefined behavior (Wasm-style safety)

```
;; Wasm: out-of-bounds load TRAPS — a clean, defined abort. Host is unharmed.
(func (param $i i32) (result i32)
  local.get $i
  i32.load        ;; if $i is past linear-memory bounds → TRAP, not memory corruption
)
```

Contrast with a naive C VM that does `return memory[i];` with no bounds check — that's a host memory read/crash on hostile input. The *defined trap on every faulting operation* is what makes Wasm safe to run untrusted.

### Example 3: Metering — bounding untrusted execution

```python
# A fuel-metered interpreter loop: untrusted code can't run forever.
def run(code, fuel):
    pc, stack = 0, []
    while True:
        if fuel <= 0:
            raise OutOfFuel(pc)        # preempt: cancellable, billable
        fuel -= COST[code[pc]]         # each opcode has a defined cost
        op = code[pc]; pc += 1
        ...                            # execute op
```

Memory safety doesn't stop `while True: pass`. Metering does. (EVM gas, BEAM reductions, and Wasm fuel are production versions of this `fuel -=` line.)

### Example 4: `invokedynamic` — an opcode designed to evolve (JVM, conceptual)

```
; A lambda call site doesn't bind to a fixed method at compile time.
invokedynamic #BootstrapMethod   ; first execution runs user-supplied "bootstrap"
                                  ; logic that LINKS the call site to a target,
                                  ; then caches it. Lambdas, string concat, and
                                  ; dynamic languages all reuse this ONE opcode.
```

One open-ended opcode let the JVM add lambdas (Java 8), optimized string concatenation (Java 9), and host dynamic languages — *without* minting a new opcode per feature. That's evolution by design.

### Example 5: Reading a `.pyc` version key (why cross-version load fails)

```python
import importlib.util
print(importlib.util.MAGIC_NUMBER.hex())  # bytes identifying THIS interpreter's bytecode

# A .pyc begins with this magic. A 3.11 interpreter writes 3.11's magic;
# a 3.12 interpreter sees a mismatch and RECOMPILES from source instead of
# loading incompatible bytecode. The version key is the safety interlock.
```

## Pros & Cons

**Owning your own bytecode**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Full control: design for your JIT, your safety model, your language | You now maintain a *platform contract* forever |
| Can meter, sandbox, and evolve on your terms | Verifier/validator is security-critical surface you must defend |
| Portable artifact across your targets | Tooling (disassembler, debugger, profiler) is on you |

**Targeting an existing bytecode (JVM/Wasm/CLR) instead**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Free world-class JIT, GC, verifier, tooling, ecosystem | You inherit the host's object model and constraints |
| Instant portability and a security model that's been hardened | Impedance mismatch if your semantics differ (e.g. tail calls on JVM) |
| No format to maintain | Less control over low-level performance |

**Running untrusted bytecode**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Extensibility: plugins, edge functions, contracts, user logic | Must get isolation + confinement + metering all right |
| Strong, checkable guarantees (vs. native code) | Validator bugs = sandbox escapes; metering bugs = DoS |
| Language-neutral extension surface | Determinism/perf trade-offs (esp. for consensus VMs) |

---

## Use Cases

- **Designing a small VM:** rules/expression engines, query evaluators, game scripting (Lua-like), feature-flag/condition languages, ETL transforms — anywhere you need safe, embeddable, evolvable user logic.
- **WebAssembly:** browser compute, **edge/serverless** (Fastly, Cloudflare Workers, Fermyon), plugin systems (Envoy, Shopify Functions, Figma plugins), and as a *universal sandbox* via WASI.
- **BEAM:** telecom, messaging (WhatsApp), and any system whose primary requirements are massive concurrency, fault isolation, and uptime.
- **Smart-contract VMs (EVM, others):** deterministic, gas-metered execution of fully untrusted code across thousands of mutually-distrusting nodes — the most adversarial bytecode environment that exists.
- **Embedding an existing VM** (JVM, V8, Wasm runtime) inside your product to run user extensions safely, instead of rolling your own.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Frequency-driven opcode allocation

Profile representative programs, sort operations by frequency, assign single-byte opcodes top-down, push the long tail behind a prefix. Re-measure as the language grows; reserve headroom so you can promote a new hot op to a single byte without a format break.

### Pattern 2: Capability-passing, no ambient authority

Untrusted bytecode gets a *bag of capabilities* (host functions, a memory, a clock-or-not) passed in at instantiation. The VM provides nothing by default. This is the Wasm/WASI model and the correct sandbox default — deny-by-default, grant explicitly.

### Pattern 3: Meter everything, make execution cancellable

Attach a cost to every opcode (or epoch-interrupt periodically). Decrement a fuel budget; on exhaustion, *suspend* (resumable) or *trap* (abort). This is what makes untrusted execution bounded, billable, and interruptible.

### Pattern 4: Additive, skippable evolution

Version the format. Never remove or repurpose an opcode/section once shipped — only add. Make unknown sections/attributes *skippable* so old consumers tolerate new producers. Reserve an `invokedynamic`-style open-ended hook for features you can't foresee.

### Pattern 5: Specialize with a deopt fallback

Generic opcode → observe → quicken to a guarded specialized opcode → on guard failure, deopt to generic. Never specialize without the fallback. This pattern scales from CPython's adaptive interpreter up to a full JIT.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Treat the bytecode as a versioned public contract** the moment anything but your own compiler produces it. Magic number, explicit version, documented opcodes and stack effects.

2. **Derive the format from non-functional requirements.** Write down what you need — fast validation? determinism? hot reload? metering? — and let those *drive* control-flow structure, typing, and opcode choices, as Wasm and the BEAM did.

3. **For untrusted code, implement all three legs: isolation, confinement, metering.** Shipping one or two is the most common production sandbox failure.

4. **Keep the validator small and fuzz it forever.** It is the trust boundary. Prefer designs (structured control flow, explicit types) that make validation cheap and total.

5. **Decide your stability promise and publish it.** "Old bytecode runs forever" (JVM) or "bytecode changes each release" (CPython) — either is fine; an undeclared one is a support nightmare.

6. **Cache compiled artifacts, keyed by version + source identity.** `.pyc`-style caches (and Wasm module caches) are huge startup wins — but the cache key must include the runtime version and a source hash, or you'll serve stale/incompatible code.

7. **Prefer targeting an existing VM unless you have a strong reason not to.** A free, hardened JIT/GC/verifier/toolchain (JVM, Wasm, V8) usually beats a homegrown VM. Roll your own when your semantics, footprint, or security model genuinely demand it.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Opcode-budget exhaustion mid-life.** Run out of single-byte codes and you're forced into a multi-byte prefix you didn't design for, hurting density and decode speed everywhere. Reserve headroom *and* a prefix from day one.

- **Nondeterminism leaking into a consensus VM.** A single float rounding difference, an unspecified map iteration order, or an accessible wall-clock breaks bit-identical execution and forks the chain. Audit *every* opcode for hidden nondeterminism.

- **Metering that's gameable.** If some opcode is under-priced relative to its real cost, attackers find it (the EVM has repriced opcodes via hard forks after DoS attacks exploited mispriced operations). Cost models must track real resource use, and be patchable.

- **Verifier/JIT semantic divergence.** If the verifier accepts something the JIT mis-handles (or vice versa), you get a soundness hole. The verifier's model and the JIT's assumptions must agree exactly — a recurring source of CVEs in mature VMs.

- **Stale or poisoned caches.** A `.pyc`/module cache keyed too loosely (or writable by an attacker) can run *old or hostile* bytecode. Key on version + content hash; consider integrity-checking persisted code caches.

- **Hot-reload state migration (BEAM-style).** Loading a new module version while the old runs requires defined switch points and careful state shape compatibility; get it wrong and live processes crash on upgrade.

- **Trusting "safe" to mean "bounded."** Memory-safe untrusted code can still spin forever or allocate until OOM. Isolation ≠ liveness. You *must* meter CPU and cap memory.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Designing the bytecode before the requirements.** The format should *fall out of* the properties you need (validation speed, determinism, metering), not be guessed first.

2. **Single-leg sandboxes.** Implementing memory isolation and calling it secure, with no capability confinement and no metering. Untrusted code then exfiltrates via ambient authority or DoSes via infinite loops.

3. **No opcode headroom or escape prefix.** Painting yourself into a 256-code corner.

4. **Letting nondeterminism into a VM that needs reproducibility** (consensus, record/replay, deterministic testing).

5. **Reinventing a VM when an existing one fits.** Building a bespoke interpreter to run user plugins when an embedded Wasm runtime or V8 isolate would give you a hardened JIT and sandbox for free.

6. **Treating the verifier as a feature instead of the security boundary.** Under-investing in fuzzing/auditing it. It is the single most attacked component.

7. **An accidental stability policy.** Changing bytecode meaning between versions without versioning, then breaking every persisted artifact and external producer.

---

## Test Yourself

1. You have a single-byte opcode field. List three concrete strategies for not running out of opcodes, and what each costs.
2. Pick three WebAssembly design decisions and trace each back to the non-functional requirement that motivated it.
3. What are the three independent legs of safely running untrusted bytecode? Give a failure mode for omitting each.
4. Why won't a 3.11 `.pyc` load in 3.12, and why did CPython choose *not* to keep bytecode stable across minor versions?
5. What problem does `invokedynamic` solve, and how does it enable additive evolution?
6. What is a "reduction" in the BEAM, and what system property does reduction-counting deliver?
7. A consensus (blockchain) VM has an extra constraint ordinary VMs don't. Name it and give two opcode-level consequences.
8. Why is the verifier/validator described as "the crown jewel," and what design choice does Wasm make to shrink it?
9. When should you target an existing VM (JVM/Wasm/V8) instead of designing your own bytecode?

## Cheat Sheet

```
DESIGNING BYTECODE
  opcode budget = 256/byte → hot ops = 1 byte; rare behind PREFIX; RESERVE headroom
  stack effect = fixed (pops,pushes) contract; verifier + max_stack depend on it
  fixed-width (JIT/decode-friendly) vs variable-width (dense)
  typed (static src) vs untyped+specialize (dynamic src)
  ALWAYS: magic number + explicit version; deopt-safe generic form of specializable ops

WASM (design-by-requirements)
  validate-before-download → structured control flow + explicit types → linear, total, 1-pass
  sandbox → linear memory (bounds-checked), capabilities (imports only), TRAPS not UB
  language-neutral, compact (LEB128, sections)

CASE STUDIES
  BEAM   register VM; REDUCTIONS → fair preemptive scheduling; no shared mem; hot reload
  CPython untyped stack VM; .pyc cache (version+hash); adaptive specialize (PEP659)→JIT

EVOLUTION  additive only (never remove/repurpose opcodes); unknown sections SKIPPABLE
  JVM = "old bytecode runs forever" (invokedynamic = open-ended hook)
  CPython = "bytecode changes each minor release" — both valid, pick on purpose

UNTRUSTED CODE = ISOLATION (verified) + CONFINEMENT (capabilities) + METERING (gas/fuel/reductions)
  + DETERMINISM for consensus VMs (no clock/float surprises/iteration-order leaks)
  validator = trust boundary → keep small, fuzz forever

## Summary

- **Designing your own bytecode** is a long-term platform commitment: budget your 256 opcodes by frequency with a reserved escape prefix, fix and document every opcode's stack effect, choose fixed vs variable width and typed vs untyped *on purpose*, and design for profiling/deopt and an explicit version + magic number from day one.
- **WebAssembly** is the modern master class: structured control flow and explicit types make validation linear/total/single-pass; linear memory + capabilities + traps make it safe for untrusted code; it's language-neutral and compact — every choice traceable to a stated requirement.
- **The BEAM** (reductions → fair preemptive scheduling, isolation, hot reload) and **CPython** (untyped stack VM, `.pyc` caching, adaptive specialization → JIT) show how requirements at opposite ends of the design space produce very different bytecode/VMs.
- **Bytecode outlives hardware and language versions.** Decide a stability promise (JVM's "forever" vs CPython's "every release"), evolve *additively*, make unknown data skippable, and use open-ended hooks like `invokedynamic`.
- **Running untrusted bytecode safely** needs three legs — **isolation** (verified memory safety), **confinement** (capabilities, no ambient authority), and **metering** (gas/fuel/reductions to bound CPU/memory) — plus **determinism** for consensus VMs, with the **validator as the crown-jewel trust boundary** to keep small and fuzz relentlessly.

This is the full arc of the topic: from "what is a `.pyc`" to "how would I design and safely operate a long-lived bytecode platform." The natural next step is the JIT-compilation topic, which consumes the bytecode this page taught you to design.
