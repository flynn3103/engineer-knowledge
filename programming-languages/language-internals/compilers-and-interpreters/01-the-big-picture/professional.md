## Introduction

At the professional tier the compiler pipeline is an engineering and product
decision, not a textbook diagram. You decide whether to build a front end on top of
an existing middle/back end or roll your own; whether optimization happens at build
time, at run time, or both; how much to invest in diagnostics (a real adoption
driver); and how to make the toolchain reproducible and trustworthy. These are the
decisions that determine whether your language compiles fast, runs fast, ships to
every platform, and can be trusted.

## The Build-vs-Buy Decision for a New Language

The pivotal architectural choice when building a language: **reuse a mature
middle/back end or write your own.**

- **Reuse LLVM** (Rust, Swift, Julia, Clang): you write only a front end and lowering
  to LLVM IR, and inherit a world-class optimizer plus every backend (x86, ARM,
  RISC-V, Wasm). Cost: LLVM is large, slow to build, and its compile times can
  dominate; you're coupled to its IR and release cadence.
- **Reuse Cranelift** (Wasmtime, some Rust debug builds): far faster compilation,
  fewer targets and optimizations — a good fit when *compile speed* beats peak codegen
  (JITs, debug builds).
- **Roll your own back end** (Go's compiler, V8, HotSpot): full control over compile
  speed, codegen, and runtime integration (GC, stacks), at the cost of doing
  instruction selection/regalloc/scheduling yourself for every target. Go did this
  deliberately for fast builds and tight runtime integration.

The decision hinges on: how many targets you need, whether peak performance or
compile speed dominates, how tightly the codegen must integrate with your runtime
(GC safepoints, stack maps), and team size.

## Where to Put the Optimizer: AOT, JIT, or Both

The same pipeline, relocated in time:

- **Pure AOT** (C/C++/Rust/Go): all stages at build time; fast startup, no warmup, no
  runtime codegen, AOT-friendly. No access to runtime profiles, so it relies on PGO
  (a training run) for profile-guided wins.
- **Pure JIT / mixed** (JVM, V8): a thin AOT front end to bytecode, then runtime
  optimization driven by real profiles (tiering, OSR, deopt). Peak throughput and
  adaptivity, but warmup cost and runtime codegen as an attack surface.
- **Both** (Spring AOT, GraalVM native-image, .NET ReadyToRun): pre-compile to reduce
  startup while keeping (or dropping) runtime adaptivity.

The cold-start and native-image pressures of serverless have pushed the industry
toward moving more work to build time — a live architectural debate your pipeline
design must answer based on deployment target and SLOs.

## Diagnostics as a Product

Error reporting is a cross-cutting concern that spans the whole front end, and at the
professional tier it's a *feature*, not an afterthought. Clang's caret diagnostics,
Rust's `rustc --explain` and suggestion-rich errors, and Elm's famously friendly
messages drove adoption. Engineering them requires: preserving accurate **source
spans** through every transformation, **error recovery** so one mistake doesn't abort
the whole compile (report many errors per run), suggested fixes, and stable error
codes. A compiler that fails fast with a cryptic message loses to one that explains
the problem and proposes a fix.

---

## Trust, Reproducibility & Supply Chain

- **Reproducible builds:** the same source + toolchain must produce bit-identical
  output, so binaries can be independently verified. This requires controlling
  nondeterminism (timestamps, paths, hash-map iteration order, parallelism) in the
  compiler — a real engineering effort (Debian, Go, and others invested heavily).
- **Trusting Trust:** Thompson's attack — a compiler binary that inserts a backdoor
  when compiling login *and* when compiling itself — means you can't fully trust a
  binary from its source alone. Diverse double-compilation (building with a second,
  independent compiler and comparing) is the known mitigation.
- **Toolchain provenance:** in regulated/secure contexts you must pin and verify the
  exact compiler, flags, and dependencies that produced a binary (SLSA, signed
  toolchains).

---

## Best Practices

- **Choose the middle/back end by your real constraint** (targets, compile speed,
  runtime integration), not by prestige.
- **Decide the AOT/JIT split from the deployment target and SLOs**, and revisit it as
  those change (e.g. adding native-image).
- **Treat diagnostics as a product** — invest in spans, recovery, and suggestions.
- **Make builds reproducible** and pin the toolchain for verifiable, secure releases.
- **Keep the IR contract stable** so front ends and back ends can evolve
  independently.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **LLVM compile-time tax:** reusing LLVM can make *your* compiler slow; some
  languages add a fast non-LLVM debug backend (Cranelift, Go-style) for iteration.
- **IR version skew:** coupling to an external IR (LLVM) means tracking its breaking
  changes across releases.
- **Cross-compilation foot-guns:** sysroot/triple/host-vs-target confusion silently
  produces wrong-arch binaries.
- **Nondeterminism leaking into output:** breaks reproducible builds; hunt down
  hash-ordering and timestamp sources.
- **Diagnostics regressions:** a refactor that drops source spans degrades every error
  message at once.

---

## War Stories

- **Rust on LLVM:** Rust got production-grade optimization and broad target support
  essentially for free by lowering to LLVM IR — but inherited LLVM's slow compile
  times, which drove years of work on incremental compilation, MIR-level
  optimization, and a Cranelift debug backend.
- **Go's own backend:** Go deliberately avoided LLVM to keep builds extremely fast and
  integrate the compiler tightly with its goroutine stacks and GC — trading peak
  codegen for compile speed and runtime cohesion.
- **Reproducible builds in Debian:** stamping out nondeterminism across thousands of
  packages required fixing timestamps, paths, and ordering throughout the toolchain —
  proving how much hidden nondeterminism a compiler pipeline carries.

---

## Summary

Professionally, the compiler pipeline is a set of engineering bets: reuse a mature
middle/back end (LLVM, Cranelift) or build your own (Go, V8) based on targets,
compile speed, and runtime integration; place the optimizer at build time, run time,
or both per your deployment SLOs; treat diagnostics as a product by preserving spans
and recovering from errors; and make the toolchain reproducible and trustworthy
against supply-chain threats like Trusting Trust. The architecture diagram is the
easy part — these decisions are what make a compiler fast, portable, friendly, and
trusted in production.
