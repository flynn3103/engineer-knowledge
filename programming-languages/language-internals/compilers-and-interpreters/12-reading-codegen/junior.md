## Introduction

> Focus: **The compiler turns your source code into machine instructions. You can read those instructions. It is not magic, and it is not only for wizards.**

When you write `a + b` in C, Rust, or any compiled language, the compiler translates it into a sequence of **machine instructions** — the actual numbers the CPU executes. Most of the time you never look at those instructions. You write source, you run the program, it works. But sometimes a question comes up that the source code *cannot* answer:

- "Did the compiler turn my multiply-by-8 into a cheap shift?"
- "Did this tiny function get *inlined* into its caller, or is there still a function call?"
- "My loop is slow — what is it actually doing per iteration?"
- "I added `const` and `-O2`; did the compiler actually compute the result at compile time?"

The only way to answer these *with evidence instead of a guess* is to **read the codegen** — the code the compiler generated. This is a learnable, practical skill, and it is one of the highest-leverage things a performance-curious engineer can pick up early.

In one sentence: **reading codegen is opening the box and looking at the gears, instead of arguing about what's inside.**

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a junior:** You will constantly hear claims like "the compiler optimizes that away" or "this is faster." Most of those claims are *folklore* — repeated without anyone ever checking. Once you know how to look at the assembly, you can settle these debates in thirty seconds with a tool called **Compiler Explorer (Godbolt)**. You stop guessing. That alone will make you more trusted than engineers twice your experience who only have opinions.

This page covers: what "the compiler's output" even is, the **one essential tool** (Compiler Explorer / Godbolt) and how to use it, the command-line flags that emit assembly (`gcc -S`, `clang -S`, `objdump -d`), the absolute basics of reading x86-64 assembly *accessibly* (registers, a handful of instructions, the AT&T-vs-Intel syntax trap), and how to recognize a few simple optimizations in the output. Higher tiers go deeper: `middle.md` covers vectorization, inlining, bounds-check elimination and `perf`; `senior.md` covers proving optimizations and the benchmark-optimized-away trap; `professional.md` covers JIT disassembly and aliasing.

## Prerequisites

What you should know before reading this:

- **Required:** How to write and compile a small program in at least one compiled language — C, C++, Rust, or Go is ideal.
- **Required:** What a function, a loop, and a variable are.
- **Required:** A rough idea that a CPU runs "instructions" one after another.
- **Helpful but not required:** Awareness that your computer has *registers* (a tiny number of super-fast storage slots inside the CPU) and *memory* (RAM, much bigger and slower).
- **Helpful but not required:** Having heard the words "optimization level" and `-O2`.

You do **not** need to know:

- How to *write* assembly by hand (we only *read* it).
- The full x86-64 instruction set (there are thousands of instructions; you need about a dozen).
- How the compiler's internal passes work (that's other topics — here we just read the *result*).
- Anything about SIMD, vectorization, or JITs yet — that's `middle.md` and up.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Codegen** | "Code generation" — the compiler's final output: machine instructions (or assembly, the human-readable form of them). |
| **Assembly (asm)** | A human-readable text form of machine instructions. One line ≈ one CPU instruction. `mov`, `add`, `call`, etc. |
| **Machine code** | The actual bytes the CPU executes. Assembly is the readable spelling of machine code. |
| **Disassembly** | Going *backwards* — taking a compiled binary and turning its bytes back into readable assembly. The tool is a *disassembler* (e.g. `objdump -d`). |
| **Compiler Explorer / Godbolt** | The essential web tool at godbolt.org: type source on the left, see the assembly on the right, instantly, for many compilers/flags/CPUs. |
| **Register** | A tiny, extremely fast storage slot inside the CPU. x86-64 has 16 general-purpose ones: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, … `r15`. |
| **Instruction (opcode)** | One operation the CPU does: move a value, add two numbers, jump, call a function. The first word on an assembly line (`mov`, `add`, `cmp`). |
| **Operand** | The thing an instruction acts on: a register, a constant (an *immediate*), or a memory location. |
| **Immediate** | A constant baked directly into an instruction, e.g. the `5` in `add rax, 5`. |
| **Optimization level** | A flag telling the compiler how hard to try: `-O0` (none, easy to debug), `-O1`, `-O2` (the usual release level), `-O3` (aggressive). |
| **Inlining** | The compiler copies a small function's body directly into its caller, removing the `call`/`ret` overhead. |
| **Constant folding** | The compiler computes a result at *compile time* (e.g. `2 + 3` becomes `5` in the output) instead of at runtime. |
| **Strength reduction** | Replacing an expensive operation with a cheaper one, e.g. `x * 8` becomes a left-shift `x << 3`. |
| **AT&T vs Intel syntax** | Two ways to *write* the same x86 assembly. They reverse operand order (`mov src, dst` vs `mov dst, src`). The single most common confusion. |
| **Prologue / Epilogue** | The setup/teardown instructions at the start/end of a function (saving registers, adjusting the stack). |
| **Label** | A named position in the assembly, like `.L3:`, used as a target for jumps. The compiler's version of "go here." |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The compiler produces text you can read

When you compile, the compiler runs your source through several stages and ends with **machine code** — bytes the CPU runs directly. Those bytes have a readable text spelling called **assembly**. You have two ways to see it:

1. **Ask the compiler to stop one step early** and print assembly instead of finishing the binary: `gcc -S file.c` produces `file.s`, a text file of assembly.
2. **Disassemble a finished binary** — take the compiled `.o` or executable and convert the bytes back to assembly: `objdump -d a.out`.

Both give you the same thing to read. The first is easier when you have the source; the second is what you use when you only have a binary.

### 2. Assembly is just a list of tiny operations

Each line of assembly is roughly one CPU instruction. They are *much* simpler than source code. There is no `for` loop instruction — a loop is built from a *compare*, a *jump*, and a *label*. There is no `a + b * c` — it's separate `mul` and `add` instructions. Reading assembly is mostly recognizing these small patterns. Here is a function that adds two numbers, on x86-64 (Intel syntax):

```asm
add_two:
        lea     eax, [rdi + rsi]   ; eax = first_arg + second_arg
        ret                        ; return (the result is in eax)
```

Three things to notice already:
- `rdi` and `rsi` are where the **first two arguments** arrive (the calling convention puts them there).
- The **return value** goes in `eax`/`rax`.
- `lea` here is being used as a sneaky "add two registers" — more on that later.

### 3. Registers: the CPU's tiny scratchpad

The CPU does almost all its work in **registers** — 16 general-purpose slots on x86-64. Their full 64-bit names are `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rsi`, `rdi`, `rbp`, `rsp`, and `r8` through `r15`. The same register has smaller names for its lower bits:

| 64-bit | 32-bit | 16-bit | 8-bit |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| `rax`  | `eax`  | `ax`   | `al`  |
| `rbx`  | `ebx`  | `bx`   | `bl`  |
| `rcx`  | `ecx`  | `cx`   | `cl`  |
| `rdi`  | `edi`  | `di`   | `dil` |

So `eax` and `rax` are the *same register* — `eax` just means "the bottom 32 bits of `rax`." Beginners get confused seeing `mov eax, 5` and `mov rax, ...` in the same function; it's one register being used at different widths. A special register, `rsp`, is the **stack pointer** (it points at the call stack); you'll see it constantly in the prologue/epilogue.

### 4. The dozen instructions you actually need

You do not need thousands of instructions. For everyday reading, these cover 90% of what you'll see:

| Instruction | What it does |
|-------------|--------------|
| `mov dst, src` | Copy `src` into `dst`. The workhorse. |
| `lea dst, [addr]` | "Load effective address" — compute an address (or, sneakily, do arithmetic) without touching memory. |
| `add` / `sub` | Add / subtract. |
| `imul` / `mul` | Multiply. |
| `cmp a, b` | Compare (subtract without storing) and set *flags*. |
| `test a, b` | Bitwise AND without storing; sets flags. Often `test rax, rax` = "is rax zero?" |
| `jmp` / `je` / `jne` / `jl` / `jg` | Jump always / jump if equal / not-equal / less / greater (based on the last `cmp`). |
| `call` / `ret` | Call a function / return from one. |
| `push` / `pop` | Put a register on the stack / take it off. |
| `xor eax, eax` | A common idiom that means "set `eax` to 0" (cheaper than `mov eax, 0`). |

That's the toolkit. The first time you read real assembly it looks dense; after an hour with Compiler Explorer, it reads like prose.

### 5. AT&T vs Intel syntax — the operand-order trap

The same machine instruction can be *written* two ways. This trips up everyone exactly once:

- **Intel syntax** (used by Compiler Explorer's default, MSVC, NASM): `mov dst, src` — **destination first**. `mov rax, 5` means "put 5 into rax."
- **AT&T syntax** (the default of `gcc -S` and `objdump` on Linux): `mov src, dst` — **source first**, with `%` on registers and `$` on constants. `mov $5, %rax` means the *same thing*: "put 5 into rax."

So the *exact same instruction* is `mov rax, 5` (Intel) or `mov $5, %rax` (AT&T). If you read it the wrong way you'll think the data is flowing backwards. **Tip:** in Compiler Explorer, there is an "Intel syntax" toggle (it's on by default), and `objdump -M intel -d` forces Intel. When starting out, pick **Intel** everywhere and stay consistent.

### 6. Addressing modes: `[base + index*scale + disp]`

When assembly touches memory, it uses brackets. The general form on x86-64 is:

```text
[base + index*scale + displacement]
```

For example `mov eax, [rdi + rcx*4 + 8]` means: take the address in `rdi`, add `rcx` times 4, add 8, and load the 32-bit value at *that* address into `eax`. This is exactly how the compiler indexes an array: `rdi` is the array start, `rcx` is the index, `4` is the element size (a 4-byte `int`), and `8` is some offset. Recognizing this pattern is how you spot array accesses in the wild.

### 7. The simplest optimizations to recognize

At your level, four optimizations are easy to spot and very satisfying:

- **Constant folding:** you write `return 2 + 3;` and the assembly is just `mov eax, 5`. The compiler did the math.
- **Strength reduction:** you write `x * 8` and instead of a multiply you see `shl` (shift left) or a `lea`. Multiplying by a power of two is a shift.
- **`xor` to zero:** `xor eax, eax` is the idiom for "set to 0," not a real XOR you should puzzle over.
- **Dead code elimination:** you write a variable that's never used, and it simply doesn't appear in the output.

Spotting these is the gateway drug. Once you see the compiler do something clever, you'll want to look every time.

## Real-World Analogies

**The recipe and the kitchen.** Your source code is a recipe ("make a sandwich"). The assembly is the actual sequence of hand motions ("pick up knife, cut bread, …"). Reading codegen is watching the cook's hands instead of reading the recipe — it tells you what *really* happens, including the shortcuts a clever cook takes that the recipe never mentioned.

**Translating a sentence.** You write an idea in English (source). The compiler translates it to a very literal, very simple language with a tiny vocabulary (assembly). Reading codegen is reading the translation to check the translator didn't lose your meaning — or to admire how concisely they said it.

**The receipt vs. the order.** You order "a coffee and a muffin" (source). The receipt itemizes exactly what was rung up (assembly). Sometimes the receipt reveals a free upgrade you didn't ask for (an optimization), or a charge you didn't expect (an extra function call). You read the receipt to see what *actually* happened at the register.

**X-ray vs. opinion.** Two doctors arguing about a broken bone is folklore. An X-ray is evidence. Compiler Explorer is the X-ray for "is this optimization happening?"

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: Source is *what*, assembly is *how*.** Your source says *what* you want. The assembly is the compiler's chosen *how*. There are usually many valid "how"s, and the compiler picks one based on the optimization level. Reading codegen tells you which "how" you got.

**Model 2: One source line ≠ one instruction.** A single line like `total += arr[i] * 2` can become five instructions, or — if the compiler folds and vectorizes — far fewer than you'd expect across a whole loop. Don't map lines 1:1. Map *patterns*: a loop, an array index, a comparison.

**Model 3: The compiler is a lazy genius.** It will do the *least work that produces your specified result*. If it can prove the answer at compile time, it bakes in the answer. If it can prove a function call is pointless, it deletes it. Reading codegen is watching this laziness in action — and noticing when it *fails* to be lazy (and asking why).

**Model 4: Registers are fast, memory is slow.** When you see lots of `mov [rsp+...], reg` (writing registers out to the stack), the compiler ran out of registers and is "spilling" to memory — a sign of pressure. When everything stays in registers, the code is tight. You'll feel this distinction more at higher tiers, but plant the seed now.

**Model 5: `-O0` is a literal translation; `-O2` is an interpretation.** At `-O0` the assembly mirrors your source almost line-for-line (great for learning and debugging). At `-O2` the compiler rearranges, deletes, and combines aggressively, so the output can look nothing like your source. To *learn* the mapping, read `-O0`. To see *optimizations*, read `-O2`.

---

## Code Examples

> All examples assume **Intel syntax** (Compiler Explorer's default). Try every one of these yourself at godbolt.org — that is the whole point.

### Example 1: Add two numbers (the "hello world" of codegen)

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

At `-O2`, x86-64:

```asm
add:
        lea     eax, [rdi + rsi]   ; eax = a + b  (rdi=a, rsi=b)
        ret
```

Reading it: arguments come in `rdi` and `rsi`. The compiler used `lea` (which can add two registers in one instruction) to compute `a + b` into `eax`, the return-value register. Then `ret`. That's the whole function. Notice there is **no stack setup** — at `-O2` for such a trivial function, the prologue/epilogue is gone.

### Example 2: The same function at `-O0` (so you can see the literal version)

```asm
add:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi   ; store a on the stack
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], esi   ; store b on the stack
        mov     edx, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]   ; load a back
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-8]   ; load b back
        add     eax, edx                 ; eax = a + b
        pop     rbp
        ret
```

Same function, *eight* instructions instead of two. At `-O0` the compiler faithfully shuffles everything through the stack (`[rbp-4]`, `[rbp-8]`) and adds a prologue (`push rbp` / `mov rbp, rsp`) and epilogue (`pop rbp`). This is why `-O0` is easy to *step through in a debugger* but is *not* what your release build looks like. **Lesson: never judge performance from `-O0` codegen.**

### Example 3: Constant folding

```c
int answer(void) {
    return 6 * 7;
}
```

At `-O2`:

```asm
answer:
        mov     eax, 42
        ret
```

The multiply is *gone*. The compiler computed `6 * 7 = 42` at compile time and just returns the constant. This is **constant folding**. If you ever wonder "does the compiler precompute this?" — look. The answer is right there.

### Example 4: Strength reduction (multiply becomes a shift)

```c
int times8(int x) {
    return x * 8;
}
```

At `-O2`:

```asm
times8:
        lea     eax, [0 + rdi*8]   ; eax = x * 8, using the scale factor
        ret
```

No `imul` instruction. The compiler used the addressing-mode `*8` scale to multiply — multiplying by a power of two is just a shift, and `lea` does it for free. This is **strength reduction**: a cheap operation replaced an expensive one. (You may also see it as `shl eax, 3`, i.e. "shift left by 3," which is the same as ×8.)

### Example 5: A simple loop (recognizing loop shape)

```c
int sum_to(int n) {
    int total = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        total += i;
    return total;
}
```

At `-O0` (so the loop is visible as a loop), simplified:

```asm
sum_to:
        ; ... prologue, total = 0, i = 0 ...
.L3:
        cmp     i, n          ; compare i with n
        jge     .L4           ; if i >= n, exit the loop
        add     total, i      ; total += i
        add     i, 1          ; i++
        jmp     .L3           ; go back to the top
.L4:
        ; ... return total ...
```

This is the universal shape of a `for` loop in assembly: a **label** at the top (`.L3`), a **compare-and-jump-out** (`cmp` + `jge`), the **body**, the **increment**, and a **jump back** (`jmp .L3`). Once you recognize this, you can find any loop in any disassembly. (Fun aside: at `-O2`, the compiler may replace this entire loop with the closed-form formula `n*(n-1)/2` — try it and watch the loop vanish.)

### Example 6: A function call vs. an inlined call

```c
static int square(int x) { return x * x; }

int use(int n) {
    return square(n) + 1;
}
```

At `-O2`:

```asm
use:
        mov     eax, edi
        imul    eax, eax       ; eax = n * n   (square was INLINED — no call!)
        add     eax, 1
        ret
```

There is **no `call square`** instruction. The compiler copied `square`'s body (`x * x`) directly into `use`. That's **inlining**. If instead you saw `call square` here, you'd know the inline *didn't* happen — a useful thing to detect. The presence or absence of a `call` is one of the first things to look for.

### Example 7: Emitting assembly from the command line

```bash
# Emit assembly text (don't make a binary). Output goes to file.s
gcc -O2 -S file.c
clang -O2 -S file.c

# Force Intel syntax (much friendlier than the AT&T default)
gcc -O2 -S -masm=intel file.c

# Disassemble a compiled binary, interleaving the source lines:
gcc -O2 -g -c file.c            # compile to file.o with debug info
objdump -d -M intel -S file.o   # disassemble, Intel syntax, with source

# Rust: emit assembly for a function (cargo-show-asm makes this nice)
rustc --emit asm -O file.rs
# or the friendly tool:
cargo install cargo-show-asm
cargo asm my_crate::my_function
```

The two most useful first commands: `gcc -O2 -S -masm=intel file.c` (clean assembly with the source) and `objdump -d -M intel a.out` (disassemble a finished binary). But honestly, for *learning*, just use Compiler Explorer.

### Example 8: Using Compiler Explorer (Godbolt) — the workflow

1. Go to **godbolt.org**.
2. Paste your function in the left pane (write it as a *function*, not `main` — it's clearer).
3. Pick a compiler (e.g. `x86-64 gcc 14`) in the right pane's dropdown.
4. Add flags in the "Compiler options" box: start with `-O2`.
5. Look at the assembly on the right. **Click a line of source** — Compiler Explorer highlights the matching assembly in the same color. This source↔asm color mapping is the single most useful feature for beginners.
6. Change the flag to `-O0`, then `-O3`, and watch the output change. Change the compiler from gcc to clang and compare. Change the architecture to ARM64 and see a completely different instruction set.

That color-mapped, instant, side-by-side view is why every performance engineer keeps a Godbolt tab open.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros of reading codegen:**

- **Evidence over folklore.** You can prove or disprove "the compiler optimizes that" instead of repeating rumors.
- **It's a debugging superpower.** Performance mysteries ("why is this loop slow?") often have an obvious answer once you look at the instructions.
- **It deepens your mental model of the machine.** You start writing code that's naturally friendlier to the compiler.
- **The essential tool (Godbolt) is free, instant, and requires no setup.**
- **Skills transfer.** The same reading skill works across C, C++, Rust, and even the output of JIT compilers.

**Cons / costs:**

- **There's a learning curve.** The first hour is disorienting (especially the AT&T/Intel trap).
- **It can be a rabbit hole.** Not every micro-difference in assembly matters; you must learn what's worth caring about (higher tiers).
- **Output is platform- and compiler-specific.** What gcc does on x86-64 may differ from clang on ARM64.
- **At `-O2`/`-O3` the mapping from source to asm gets loose**, so it takes practice to follow.
- **Reading asm tells you *what* but not always *how fast*** — you still need profiling (`perf`) to know which instructions actually cost time.

---

## Use Cases

- **Settling an optimization debate.** "Does the compiler turn `x / 2` into a shift?" Paste it into Godbolt, look, done.
- **Verifying inlining.** A small hot function that *should* be inlined — check whether the `call` is gone.
- **Confirming constant folding.** You expect a compile-time constant; confirm the output is a single `mov`.
- **Understanding a slow loop.** Read the per-iteration instructions to see what work is really happening.
- **Learning the machine.** Reading `-O0` codegen for small functions is the best way to *understand* how high-level constructs map to hardware.
- **Comparing two ways to write the same thing.** Put both in Godbolt and see if they produce identical assembly (often they do — meaning style choice has zero runtime cost).
- **Sanity-checking a microbenchmark.** Making sure the thing you're benchmarking wasn't optimized away entirely (a classic trap covered at higher tiers).

---

## Coding Patterns

These are *reading* patterns — repeatable moves for getting answers fast.

### Pattern 1: Always write it as a function, never `main`

```c
// Good for reading: a clean function with arguments.
int target(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
```

If you put your code in `main` with hardcoded values, the compiler will constant-fold everything and you'll see `mov eax, 5` with no logic. Writing a *function with parameters* forces the compiler to produce real, general code you can read.

### Pattern 2: Compare two optimization levels side by side

Open the function at `-O0` to learn the literal mapping, then switch to `-O2` to see what the optimizer did. The *difference* between them is the optimization. Compiler Explorer lets you open two compiler panes at once — `-O0` on the left, `-O2` on the right.

### Pattern 3: Search for the `call`

When checking inlining, the single fastest move is to look for `call`. If the function you expected to be inlined still shows `call funcname`, the inline didn't happen. No `call` (and the callee's logic appears inline) means it did.

### Pattern 4: Click the source line, follow the color

In Godbolt, click a line of source. The matching assembly lights up in the same color. This instantly answers "which instructions came from this line?" — invaluable when the output is large.

### Pattern 5: Force Intel syntax everywhere

```bash
objdump -d -M intel a.out
gcc -S -masm=intel file.c
```

In Compiler Explorer, the "Intel" toggle is on by default — leave it. Pick one syntax (Intel) and never fight the operand-order confusion again.

### Pattern 6: Use `-g` and `objdump -S` to see source alongside disassembly

```bash
gcc -O2 -g -c file.c
objdump -d -M intel -S file.o
```

The `-S` flag interleaves your *source lines* with the disassembly, so you don't have to map instructions back to source by hand.

---

## Best Practices

- **Use Compiler Explorer first.** Before reaching for command-line tools, paste it into godbolt.org. It's faster and the color mapping is unbeatable for learning.
- **Always read at the optimization level you ship.** If your release build is `-O2`, read `-O2`. Reading `-O0` to *judge performance* is meaningless.
- **Pick Intel syntax and commit to it.** Mixing syntaxes is the #1 cause of "wait, which way does the data flow?" confusion.
- **Write minimal examples.** Isolate the *one* function you care about. Smaller examples produce readable output.
- **Start with constant folding and strength reduction.** They're the most visible and most satisfying optimizations to learn to spot.
- **Recognize patterns, not every instruction.** You don't need to understand every line — find the loop, find the `call`, find the array index.
- **Verify before you claim.** If you're about to tell a teammate "the compiler handles that," look first. Be the person with the X-ray.
- **Keep a cheat sheet of the ~12 instructions** near you until they're second nature.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **The AT&T/Intel operand-order trap.** `mov a, b` means opposite things in the two syntaxes. If your reading of the data flow seems backwards, you're probably in the *other* syntax. Force Intel and re-read.
- **Reading `-O0` and assuming it's your release code.** `-O0` is a deliberately literal, slow translation full of stack traffic. Your shipped `-O2` build looks completely different. Never benchmark or judge speed from `-O0` output.
- **Putting test values in `main` and seeing them folded.** If you hardcode inputs, the compiler computes the answer at compile time and you see *no logic*. Always use a function with real parameters.
- **`eax` and `rax` confusing you.** They're the *same register* at different widths (32-bit vs 64-bit). `mov eax, X` zeroes the top 32 bits of `rax` as a side effect — a quirk you'll meet later; for now just know they're the same register.
- **`xor eax, eax` looking like a puzzle.** It's just the idiom for "set `eax` to 0." Don't overthink it.
- **`lea` looking like a memory load.** `lea` ("load *effective address*") often does *arithmetic*, not a memory access — e.g. `lea eax, [rdi + rsi]` is just `a + b`. The brackets don't always mean "touch memory."
- **Expecting source lines and assembly lines to line up 1:1.** They don't. The compiler reorders and merges. Use the color mapping (Godbolt) or `objdump -S` instead of counting lines.
- **Different compiler = different output.** gcc and clang make different (both valid) choices. If you compare to a tutorial that used the other compiler, the assembly won't match exactly — that's normal.
- **The output for the *wrong architecture*.** Make sure Godbolt's compiler is `x86-64` if that's your target; selecting an ARM compiler gives totally different mnemonics, which is great to know but confusing if unexpected.
- **Forgetting `-O2` entirely.** Many "the compiler didn't optimize this!" panics are just someone reading the default (often `-O0`) output. Add `-O2` and look again.
