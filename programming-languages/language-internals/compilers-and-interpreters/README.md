# Compilers & Interpreters Roadmap

> *"A compiler is just a function from strings to strings — but it's the most interesting such function ever written."*

This roadmap is about **how a programming language is turned into something that runs** — lexing, parsing, type-checking, optimization, code generation, and the runtime that supports it all. It's also the gateway to the practical skills every senior engineer needs: writing DSLs, reading compiler errors fluently, understanding why the language behaves the way it does at the edges.

> Looking for the *CS-foundations angle* (formal grammars, automata theory, optimization theory)? See Architecture → CS → Compilers — that section approaches compilers as a CS topic. **This** roadmap approaches them as a tool a working engineer reaches for (parsing DSLs, building linters, reading codegen output).
>
> Looking for *build orchestration* (make, bazel, cargo)? See Build Systems.

## Why a Dedicated Roadmap

Most engineers will never write a production compiler — but most engineers *will*:

- Read a parser/AST library (Tree-sitter, ANTLR, `go/ast`)
- Write a small DSL or a config-language interpreter
- Debug "why does the compiler emit this weird code?"
- Implement a linter, codemod, or codegen tool
- Read LLVM IR or JVM bytecode to understand a performance issue

This roadmap targets that working-engineer slice — the parts of compilers that **show up in everyday senior work**.

| Roadmap | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| [Type Systems](../type-systems/README.md) | What can the compiler prove about my program? |
| Build Systems | How is source turned into a runnable artifact? |
| **Compilers & Interpreters** (this) | How does a language *actually* understand and execute code? |

## Languages

The roadmap is meta-linguistic: examples in **Go** (writing a small interpreter, using `go/ast` and `go/parser`), **Java** (reading bytecode, ASM), **Python** (`ast` module, building DSLs), and **Rust** (`syn`, procedural macros) — the four languages most likely to show up in real codegen / tooling work.

---

## Status

✅ **Content-complete — all 12 topics written across the six-file set (junior / middle / senior / professional / interview / tasks).**
