# DSLs in Practice — Senior Level

> **Topic:** DSLs in Practice
> **Focus:** Production external DSLs — compiling vs interpreting at scale, **sandboxing untrusted DSLs** (resource limits, no arbitrary code), grammar **versioning**, and the **tooling burden** (LSP, formatter, highlighting). And the discipline that keeps a DSL from quietly becoming a programming language.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What does it take to run an external DSL in production — safely, fast, and maintainably — for years?**

By now the pipeline is routine: design a grammar, lex, parse (recursive descent / Pratt / combinators / ANTLR), build an AST, then interpret or transpile. The senior problems are different. They are about *operating* a DSL as a long-lived product:

1. **Performance at scale.** A rules DSL evaluating millions of events per second cannot tree-walk each time. You compile to **bytecode** for a tiny VM, or transpile to a target the platform already runs fast (SQL, native via LLVM, host-language source). When and how to make that jump is a senior call.
2. **Security.** The moment your DSL evaluates **untrusted input** — a formula a customer typed into a spreadsheet, a rule an external partner uploaded, a filter from a public API — it becomes an attack surface. You must guarantee **no arbitrary code execution**, bound **CPU and memory**, prevent **infinite loops**, and stop the DSL from reaching the host's file system, network, or process. This is the single most under-appreciated part of building DSLs, and the part that separates a senior implementation from a toy.
3. **Evolution.** A DSL ships, customers write thousands of files in it, and now you must add a feature without breaking them. **Versioning the grammar**, deprecation, and migration are real engineering problems.
4. **Tooling.** A language people use daily needs syntax highlighting, a formatter, and ideally a **language server (LSP)** giving completion and inline errors in editors. This is permanent, ongoing cost — the part teams forget when they decide to "just build a small DSL."

Running through all of it is one discipline: **resisting Turing-completeness creep.** Config languages that grew loops, variables, and conditionals — and so became unsandboxable, untestable programming languages by accident — are a recurring industry cautionary tale. A senior engineer scopes the language deliberately and *defends that scope*.

Keep the internal/external distinction sharp: an **internal** DSL inherits the host's sandbox story (or lack of one) and tooling, but you cannot give it its own safe evaluation model. An **external** DSL lets you *guarantee* "this language cannot do arbitrary I/O" — precisely because you wrote every operation it can perform. That guarantee is often the whole reason to choose external in the first place.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at the senior level:** The hard questions are no longer "how do I parse this?" but "can a hostile user hang my server with a crafted formula?", "how do I add a feature to a DSL 4,000 customer files depend on?", and "who maintains the language server next year?" Getting these right is what makes a DSL an asset instead of a liability.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The middle-level material — the four parsing techniques, the front-end/back-end split, interpret vs transpile, environments and scoping.
- **Required:** Comfort reading bytecode/VM concepts (a stack machine, opcodes) and a working idea of what a compiler back end does.
- **Required:** Security fundamentals: what "arbitrary code execution" means, why `eval` of untrusted strings is dangerous, what a resource limit is.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to LLVM or any IR-based compiler back end (for the "compile to native" discussion).
- **Helpful:** Having used or written a language server / editor extension, even a small one.

You do **not** need: formal type-theory or production-compiler internals beyond the conceptual level. This is applied DSL engineering, not compiler research.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Bytecode** | A flat list of simple instructions for a small virtual machine, compiled from the AST. Faster than tree-walking for repeated runs. |
| **VM (virtual machine)** | The loop that executes bytecode — usually a stack machine (`PUSH`, `ADD`, `JUMP`). |
| **JIT** | Just-in-time compilation: turning hot bytecode into native code at runtime. Rare for DSLs but possible. |
| **Transpile** | Compile to another high-level language (SQL, JS, Go source). Reuses that target's engine. |
| **Sandbox** | An execution environment that limits what code can do — no file/network access, bounded CPU/memory/time. |
| **Untrusted input** | DSL text written by someone you do not control (a customer, a partner, the public). Must be assumed hostile. |
| **Resource limit** | A cap on steps executed, memory allocated, or wall-clock time, enforced by the evaluator. |
| **Turing-completeness creep** | The gradual addition of loops/recursion/conditionals to a "config" or "rule" language until it is a full programming language — and no longer safe or analysable. |
| **Total / terminating language** | A language guaranteed to halt (no unbounded loops/recursion). Sandboxable by construction. Dhall and CUE aim for this. |
| **Grammar versioning** | Evolving DSL syntax over time without breaking existing files — version headers, deprecations, migrations. |
| **LSP (Language Server Protocol)** | A standard protocol so one "language server" provides completion, errors, and navigation to many editors. |
| **Linter / formatter** | Tools that check style/correctness and canonicalise layout for your DSL. |
| **Capability** | A specific power granted to DSL code (e.g. "may read field X"). A sandbox grants capabilities explicitly rather than allowing everything. |
| **Fuel / gas** | A decrementing counter that bounds execution; when it hits zero, evaluation aborts. Borrowed from blockchain VMs but useful anywhere. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Compiling a DSL: bytecode and beyond

Tree-walking is `O(tree size)` of pointer chasing per evaluation — fine for config evaluated once, ruinous for a rule run on every request. The standard upgrade path:

- **AST → bytecode → VM.** Compile the tree once into a flat opcode array (`PUSH 18`, `LOAD age`, `GT`, `JMPF ...`). A stack-machine loop executes it. This removes recursion overhead and dramatically improves cache behaviour; 5–50× over tree-walking is typical. Lua, Python, and most embedded scripting languages work this way, and it is the right model for a hot rules DSL.
- **AST → host source (transpile).** Emit Go/JS/C from the AST, compile it with the host toolchain, and call it. You inherit a real optimiser. Good when the DSL is fixed at deploy time, not edited live.
- **AST → SQL.** The dominant case for query/filter DSLs. Push the work into the database engine. The database's planner, indexes, and parallelism are yours for free.
- **AST → LLVM IR → native.** The heavyweight option: generate LLVM IR and let LLVM produce optimised machine code. Justified only for compute-heavy DSLs run at scale (numerical/financial expression languages, query JITs). Most DSLs never need it.

Choosing among these is an explicit trade of build complexity against runtime speed and operability.

### 2. Sandboxing untrusted DSLs — the core senior skill

If outsiders supply DSL source, you must treat the evaluator as a security boundary. The guarantees you need:

- **No arbitrary code execution.** The DSL must *not* be implemented by translating to `eval()` of host code, by reflecting into host functions, or by exposing the host's standard library. Every operation the DSL can perform is one *you* explicitly implemented. This is the decisive advantage of an external DSL: its powers are exactly the opcodes/builtins you wrote.
- **Bounded CPU / steps.** Enforce a **fuel/gas** counter or a step limit; abort when exceeded. Without this, `while true {}` (if you were unwise enough to add loops) or even a deep expression can hang a worker.
- **Bounded memory.** Cap allocation — list sizes, string lengths, recursion depth — so a crafted input cannot OOM the process.
- **Bounded time.** A wall-clock deadline as a backstop, ideally enforced out-of-process or via cooperative checks.
- **No ambient authority.** The DSL cannot open files, make network calls, spawn processes, or read environment variables unless you *explicitly* expose a narrow, audited capability (e.g. a `lookup(customerId)` builtin that only reads one table).
- **Allow-list, not deny-list.** Grant the small set of fields/functions the DSL needs. Never start from "everything" and try to subtract dangerous things — you will miss one.

The cleanest sandbox is a **terminating (total) language**: no unbounded loops or recursion at all, so it provably halts. Dhall and CUE are designed this way precisely so untrusted config cannot loop forever. If your domain allows it, *not* having loops is the strongest sandbox you can ship.

### 3. Versioning and evolving the grammar

Once files exist in the wild, the grammar is an API. Treat changes like API changes:

- **Add, don't reshape.** New optional keywords/clauses are usually backward-compatible; renaming or removing breaks files.
- **Version markers.** A `version = 2` header (or file extension, or schema field) lets the parser select grammar rules and lets you run old and new in parallel.
- **Deprecation with warnings.** Emit a warning (with position) for soon-to-be-removed syntax before deleting it.
- **Mechanical migration.** Because you own the parser, you can write a tool that parses v1, transforms the AST, and *prints* v2 — automatic upgrades for users. Your formatter and your migrator share the AST-to-source printer.
- **A conformance test corpus.** Keep a frozen set of real-world files and their expected results; run them on every grammar change to catch regressions.

### 4. The tooling burden

A DSL people live in needs more than a parser:

- **Syntax highlighting.** A TextMate grammar / Tree-sitter grammar / regex set for editors. Cheap but expected.
- **A formatter.** Canonical layout (your AST-to-source printer again). Eliminates style arguments; enables clean diffs.
- **A language server (LSP).** Reuses your front end to provide *as-you-type* errors, completion (you know the valid keywords/fields), hover docs, and go-to-definition — across VS Code, Neovim, JetBrains, etc., from one server. This is where most of the maintenance cost of a successful DSL goes.
- **Documentation and a playground.** A browser REPL that runs the interpreter on sample input shortens the learning curve enormously.

The honest senior framing: **a DSL is not the parser; it is the parser plus a language to maintain plus tooling, forever.** That total cost is the real "build a DSL vs use a library/config" decision.

### 5. The accidental-programming-language trap

Config formats famously slide into Turing-completeness: someone adds variables "for DRY," then conditionals "for environments," then functions, then loops. The endpoint is a slow, untyped, untooled, *unsandboxable* programming language that nobody designed. Real-world lineage includes templating languages that grew control flow and YAML-based CI configs that sprouted expression mini-languages. The defenses:

- **Decide up front whether the language is total** (no loops/recursion) and *enforce* it in the grammar.
- **Push computation out.** If users need real logic, give them a way to call out to *reviewed host functions*, not a way to write logic inside the config.
- **Say no.** Each feature request is weighed against the permanent cost and the loss of safety/analysability. "Use a real programming language for that" is often the right answer.

## Real-World Analogies

**The sandbox is a casino's chips.** Inside the casino you can only use chips (the DSL's allowed operations); you cannot spend real money (host capabilities) at the tables. To convert chips to anything real you must go to a controlled cashier (an explicit, audited builtin). That is exactly an allow-listed external DSL.

**Fuel/gas is a metered taxi.** The meter ticks with every operation; when the fare hits the cap, the ride stops — no matter where you are. A hostile passenger cannot drive you forever.

**Grammar versioning is electrical plug standards.** New devices (v2 files) get new plugs, but you ship adapters (migrators) and keep old sockets (v1 parsing) alive for years so nothing already installed stops working.

**A language server is a spell-checker that knows your DSL.** It does not run your program; it reuses the parser to underline mistakes and suggest the next valid word as you type — across every editor, from one engine.

**Turing-completeness creep is a treehouse becoming a skyscraper.** Each plank ("just one variable") seems harmless, but you end up with an unpermitted high-rise on a foundation poured for a treehouse, and no inspector ever signed off.

---

## Mental Models

- **An external DSL's power set is exactly what you implemented.** Security flows from this: list the opcodes/builtins and you have listed everything a hostile input can do. Keep that list short and audited.
- **Sandboxing is allow-list plus resource limits plus no ambient authority.** All three. Drop any one and you have a hole: unlimited fuel hangs you; ambient file access exfiltrates data; a deny-list eventually misses something.
- **Total beats sandboxed.** A language that *cannot* loop needs no step limit to guarantee halting. Prefer designing the danger out over policing it.
- **The AST-to-source printer is reused everywhere.** Formatter, migrator, "fix-it" suggestions all need to turn an AST back into text. Build it once, well.
- **Every DSL feature is a forever cost** across grammar, parser, evaluator, sandbox, docs, formatter, and language server. Multiply the request by that list before saying yes.

## Code Examples

### A bytecode VM for an expression DSL

Compile the AST once to opcodes, then run a stack machine. This is the standard performance upgrade from tree-walking.

```python
# --- compile AST -> bytecode ---
def compile_expr(node, code):
    kind = node[0]
    if kind == "number":
        code.append(("PUSH", node[1]))
    elif kind == "var":
        code.append(("LOAD", node[1]))
    elif kind == "binop":
        compile_expr(node[2], code)         # left
        compile_expr(node[3], code)         # right
        code.append(("OP", node[1]))        # +, -, *, /
    return code

# --- the VM: a stack machine with a fuel limit (sandbox) ---
def run_vm(code, env, fuel=10_000):
    stack = []
    for op, arg in code:
        fuel -= 1
        if fuel <= 0:
            raise RuntimeError("execution budget exceeded")   # bound CPU
        if op == "PUSH":  stack.append(arg)
        elif op == "LOAD":
            if arg not in env:                                # allow-list vars
                raise RuntimeError(f"unknown variable {arg}")
            stack.append(env[arg])
        elif op == "OP":
            b = stack.pop(); a = stack.pop()
            stack.append({"+":a+b,"-":a-b,"*":a*b,"/":a/b}[arg])
    return stack.pop()

tree = ("binop", "+", ("var", "x"), ("binop", "*", ("number", 4), ("number", 2)))
code = compile_expr(tree, [])
print(code)                       # [('LOAD','x'),('PUSH',4),('PUSH',2),('OP','*'),('OP','+')]
print(run_vm(code, {"x": 3}))     # 11
```

Notice the two sandbox controls baked into the VM: a **fuel counter** bounding CPU, and **variable access through an allow-listing env** — there is no opcode that touches the file system, the network, or host code, by construction.

### Sandboxing a customer-supplied rules DSL

A formula/rules language evaluated on untrusted input. The whole defense is: *the only things it can do are the things this evaluator implements.*

```python
import time

class Sandbox:
    def __init__(self, fields, *, step_limit=5000, time_limit=0.05):
        self.fields = fields                 # allow-listed, read-only inputs
        self.step_limit = step_limit
        self.time_limit = time_limit

    def eval(self, node):
        self.steps = 0
        self.deadline = time.monotonic() + self.time_limit
        return self._eval(node)

    def _tick(self):
        self.steps += 1
        if self.steps > self.step_limit:
            raise RuntimeError("step limit exceeded")
        if time.monotonic() > self.deadline:
            raise RuntimeError("time limit exceeded")

    def _eval(self, node):
        self._tick()
        kind = node[0]
        if kind == "number":  return node[1]
        if kind == "field":                  # ONLY the allow-listed inputs
            name = node[1]
            if name not in self.fields:
                raise RuntimeError(f"field not allowed: {name}")
            return self.fields[name]
        if kind == "and":  return self._eval(node[1]) and self._eval(node[2])
        if kind == "or":   return self._eval(node[1]) or  self._eval(node[2])
        if kind == "cmp":
            _, op, a, b = node
            x, y = self._eval(a), self._eval(b)
            return {">":x>y, "<":x<y, "=":x==y, ">=":x>=y, "<=":x<=y}[op]
        # NOTE: there is deliberately NO node type for calling host functions,
        # importing, file I/O, loops, or recursion. The language is total.
        raise RuntimeError(f"illegal node {kind}")

sb = Sandbox(fields={"age": 25, "country": "US"})
rule = ("and", ("cmp", ">", ("field", "age"), ("number", 18)),
               ("cmp", "=", ("field", "country"), ("number", "US")))
print(sb.eval(rule))   # True
```

The security argument is *enumerable*: the `_eval` switch lists every power the language has. There is no path to host code, so there is nothing to escape into. Step and time limits bound cost; the field allow-list bounds reach. This is what "no arbitrary code execution" looks like in practice — and why it is far easier to guarantee for an external DSL than for an internal one embedded in the host.

### A formatter / migrator via an AST-to-source printer

One printer powers the formatter *and* the version-2 migrator.

```python
def to_source(node):
    kind = node[0]
    if kind == "number": return repr(node[1])
    if kind == "field":  return node[1]
    if kind == "cmp":    return f"{to_source(node[2])} {node[1]} {to_source(node[3])}"
    if kind == "and":    return f"{to_source(node[1])} and {to_source(node[2])}"
    if kind == "or":     return f"{to_source(node[1])} or {to_source(node[2])}"

# formatter: parse(text) -> to_source(ast)  yields canonical layout
# migrator:  parse_v1(text) -> transform(ast) -> to_source(ast)  yields v2 text
```

Because you own the parser and the printer, automatic, lossless upgrades for thousands of user files become a small program rather than a manual slog.

## Pros & Cons

**Compiling to bytecode** — *for:* big runtime speedups, stable execution model, easy to add a fuel limit; *against:* a compiler and VM to build and debug; harder to trace than tree-walking.

**Transpiling to SQL/host** — *for:* inherits a mature engine and optimiser; *against:* debugging through generated code; semantic mismatches between DSL and target.

**LLVM/native** — *for:* maximum speed for compute-heavy DSLs; *against:* heavy dependency and expertise; overkill for most DSLs.

**Sandboxing (resource limits + allow-list)** — *for:* makes untrusted evaluation safe; the reason to choose external; *against:* every builtin is a security review; limits add overhead and edge cases (what happens at the budget boundary?).

**Total/terminating design** — *for:* provable halting, strongest sandbox; *against:* users sometimes genuinely need iteration, and saying no is socially hard.

**Full tooling (LSP/formatter/highlighting)** — *for:* adoption, productivity, fewer support tickets; *against:* large, permanent maintenance cost most teams underestimate.

---

## Use Cases

- **Spreadsheet / formula languages** — untrusted, must be sandboxed and (ideally) total; compiled for recalculation speed.
- **Rules / policy engines** — e-commerce promotions, access policies (think a policy DSL), fraud rules; evaluated on every event, so compiled and sandboxed.
- **Query/filter DSLs at scale** — transpiled to SQL to push work into the database.
- **Config languages** — HCL/Terraform, Dhall, Jsonnet, CUE; Dhall/CUE are deliberately total to keep config safe and predictable.
- **Numeric/financial expression languages** — high throughput; candidates for bytecode or LLVM.
- **Template engines under multi-tenant load** — must sandbox per-tenant templates against resource exhaustion and data leakage.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern: AST → bytecode → stack VM

Compile once, execute many. Carry a fuel counter in the VM loop for an always-on CPU bound.

### Pattern: enumerable-capability evaluator

Implement the evaluator as an explicit switch over node types with *no* fall-through to host code. The switch *is* the security model and the audit surface.

### Pattern: resource budget threaded through evaluation

A `_tick()` called at every node decrements steps and checks a deadline. Wall-clock as a backstop; step count as the primary, deterministic limit.

### Pattern: allow-list capabilities, not deny-list

Inject the exact fields/functions the DSL may use. New powers require an explicit, reviewed addition.

### Pattern: one AST-to-source printer, many consumers

Formatter, version migrator, and "fix-it" suggestions all reuse it. Keep it total and round-trip-safe (`parse(to_source(ast)) == ast`).

### Pattern: conformance corpus in CI

Freeze representative real files plus expected outputs; run on every grammar/evaluator change to catch breakage and silent semantic drift.

---

## Best Practices

- **Treat the evaluator as a trust boundary** the instant any input is not fully controlled by your team. Allow-list, resource limits, no ambient authority — all three.
- **Prefer a total language.** If the domain does not need iteration, forbid it in the grammar and gain provable halting for free.
- **Compile only when measured.** Tree-walk until profiling shows the evaluator is hot; then move to bytecode. Don't pre-build a VM you don't need.
- **Transpile onto mature engines** (SQL, the host language) when semantics align — it is usually less code and more performance than a bespoke runtime.
- **Version the grammar from v1.** Ship a version marker and a conformance corpus before you have users, not after.
- **Own the AST-to-source printer.** It unlocks formatter, migrator, and fix-its, and it is the backbone of grammar evolution.
- **Budget for tooling.** If the DSL will be used daily, plan the LSP/highlighting/formatter as part of the project, not a someday. If you cannot fund tooling, reconsider building the DSL at all.
- **Defend the scope.** Write down what the language deliberately cannot do and review every feature request against it.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **The sandbox escape via a "helpful" builtin.** A `now()`, `lookup()`, or `http()` builtin added for convenience can reintroduce ambient authority or side channels. Every builtin is a security review; audit what it can reach.
- **Resource limit at the boundary.** What happens *exactly* when fuel hits zero mid-operation? Partial state, half-written output, or a misleading result are all hazards. Abort cleanly and atomically.
- **Step limits that aren't deterministic.** Wall-clock-only limits make the same input pass on a fast machine and fail on a slow one. Prefer a deterministic step/fuel count as the primary bound; use time only as a backstop.
- **Recursion depth as a DoS.** Even without loops, deeply nested expressions can blow the host stack during parsing or evaluation. Cap nesting depth in the parser.
- **Transpiler injection.** Emitting SQL/HTML/shell by string concatenation reintroduces injection. Parameterise or escape; never interpolate untrusted values into generated code.
- **Breaking changes disguised as additions.** A "new optional keyword" that changes the meaning of an existing one is a breaking change. Run the conformance corpus to prove backward compatibility.
- **Turing-completeness creep, one PR at a time.** Each feature looks harmless in isolation. The aggregate turns your safe config into an unsandboxable language. Re-evaluate the *whole* against the original scope, not just the diff.
- **Tooling rot.** A language server that lags the grammar gives wrong errors and erodes trust. Generate highlighting/completion data from the same grammar source where possible so they cannot drift.
- **Assuming the GIL or host VM bounds cost.** Host-level safety (a GIL, a memory-managed runtime) does not bound *your DSL's* execution. You must impose limits yourself.

You can now run an external DSL as a real product: compiled for speed where it matters, sandboxed for untrusted input, versioned for evolution, and tooled for daily use — without letting it metastasise into an accidental programming language. The `professional.md` level steps back to the *strategic* view: the org-wide build-vs-buy decision, total cost of ownership, governance of a DSL used by many teams, ANTLR-vs-hand-written at production scale, and the long-term maintenance and deprecation of a language your company depends on.
