## Introduction

> 🎓 At junior level you learned a runtime exists. At middle level you learned the contract — allocation calls, write barriers, safepoints, stack-growth checks. At senior level you must implement that contract's hard parts in your head: **what exactly does a write barrier compile to, how does a safepoint actually stop a thread, how does the unwinder find the handler, and how does an `async fn` become a state machine you can poll?** These are the lowerings that separate "I use a runtime" from "I could build one."

The throughline of this tier is **compiler-driven lowering**: taking a high-level construct your source expresses and transforming it into low-level code plus runtime calls plus metadata. Four lowerings matter most:

1. **GC barriers** — the precise shape of insertion (Dijkstra/Yuasa style), and why the barrier exists (the tri-color invariant). The GC *algorithm* belongs to the memory-management section; here we own the *compiler's emitted barrier* and the *safepoint* that lets the GC run.
2. **Safepoints and preemption** — how a running thread is brought to a stop where its stack is describable, including Go's signal-based asynchronous preemption and the JVM's poll-page trick.
3. **Exception handling** — zero-cost EH: unwind tables, the **personality routine**, and two-phase unwinding, all of which the compiler emits *metadata* for rather than runtime checks on the happy path.
4. **Async/await as a state machine** — the coroutine transform that turns straight-line `async` code into a struct holding a discriminant plus saved locals, with a `poll`/`resume` method the runtime's executor drives.

We close on the **runtime startup path** in detail and on **fat vs thin** as a deliberate engineering trade — why Rust ships *no* GC/scheduler runtime by design, and what that buys (embedded, FFI-friendly, predictable) and costs (you write the async executor; you manage memory). Deep GC internals and stack-management internals live in the memory-management and runtime-systems sections; this page always reasons from **what the compiler must emit**.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The middle tier — the compiler/runtime contract, G-M-P scheduling, growable stacks, escape analysis.
- **Required:** Comfort with assembly-level mental models (registers, the stack pointer, prologues) and with reading Rust/Go/C++.
- **Required:** A working understanding of garbage collection mechanics (tri-color marking) at the level the memory-management section provides.
- **Helpful:** Exposure to `async/await` in Rust, C#, or JavaScript, and to exceptions in C++/Java.
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with calling conventions and the System V / Itanium ABIs.

You do **not** need to know:

- The full GC algorithm zoo (generational, region-based, concurrent compaction) — memory-management section.
- JIT internals or runtime embedding — that's `professional.md`.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Tri-color invariant** | GC reachability is tracked by coloring objects white (unreached), gray (reached, children pending), black (reached, children scanned). The invariant a barrier protects: no black object points to a white object without the GC knowing. |
| **Write barrier (Dijkstra/insertion)** | On a pointer write, shade the *target* gray so it won't be missed. Protects the invariant for concurrent marking. |
| **Write barrier (Yuasa/deletion)** | On overwrite, remember the *old* pointer so a snapshot-at-the-beginning collector doesn't lose it. Go uses a hybrid. |
| **Read barrier** | Code on pointer *reads* (used by some moving/concurrent collectors, e.g. ZGC's load barrier) to maintain invariants or redirect to moved objects. |
| **Safepoint** | An instruction where the thread's register/stack state is fully describable (stack map present) so the runtime can stop it for GC or preemption. |
| **Poll page / safepoint poll** | A read of a guard page that the runtime can make unreadable to trap all threads at their next poll (HotSpot technique). |
| **Stack map** | Per-safepoint metadata: which slots/registers hold live GC pointers, for precise scanning and for relocation when stacks move. |
| **Unwind table (`.eh_frame`/`.gcc_except_table`)** | Compiler-emitted DWARF CFI describing how to restore registers and find handlers while walking up the stack during an exception. |
| **Personality routine** | A language-specific runtime function the unwinder calls per frame to decide "does this frame handle the exception / need cleanup?" |
| **Two-phase unwinding** | Phase 1 (search) finds the handler without changing state; phase 2 (cleanup) runs destructors/`finally` and transfers control. |
| **Coroutine transform / lowering** | The compiler pass that rewrites a suspendable function into a state machine with saved locals and a resume point. |
| **State machine (async)** | The struct the compiler generates from an `async fn`: a discriminant (which `.await` we're at) plus the live locals across suspension points. |
| **`Future` / `poll`** | Rust's model: a state machine implementing `poll(cx) -> Poll<T>` that the executor calls; returns `Pending` or `Ready`. |
| **Executor / reactor** | The runtime that drives futures: polls them, parks them on `Pending`, and wakes them when I/O is ready (Rust's Tokio, C#'s thread pool + sync context). |
| **Self-referential future** | A future whose state machine holds a pointer into its own saved locals; the reason Rust needs `Pin`. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Write Barriers and the Tri-Color Invariant

A concurrent mark-sweep GC colors objects white/gray/black and must preserve the **strong tri-color invariant**: *no black object holds a pointer to a white object* (a black object is "done", so the GC won't revisit it; if it points to an untracked white object, that object would be freed while live). Mutator pointer writes can violate this, so the compiler emits a **write barrier** on heap pointer stores.

Two classic shapes:

- **Dijkstra insertion barrier:** when you store `slot = ptr`, shade `ptr` gray (push it onto the GC work list). Now no black-to-white edge can be created unseen.
- **Yuasa deletion barrier (snapshot-at-the-beginning):** when you overwrite `*slot`, first remember the *old* value so the collector still scans what was reachable at the cycle's start.

Go uses a **hybrid (Yuasa + Dijkstra)** barrier so it can avoid re-scanning stacks (stacks are scanned once and stay black). The barrier is *conditional*: it only does real work while the GC is in the mark phase. Conceptually the compiler emits:

```text
store of pointer p into heap slot s:
    if writeBarrier.enabled {           // a global flag the GC flips on at mark start
        runtime.gcWriteBarrier(s, p)    // record old/new for the marker
    }
    *s = p
```

The cost is a predicted-not-taken branch on the fast path (GC off) and a buffered record on the slow path. This is the price the *compiler* pays so the *GC* can run concurrently. Crucially, **only heap pointer writes are barriered** — stack writes are not, which is why stacks must be re-scanned at a safepoint (or kept black via the hybrid barrier).

### 2. Safepoints: How You Actually Stop a Thread

The GC's mark/sweep and the scheduler's preemption both need threads stopped at points where stack maps are valid. There are two strategies:

- **Cooperative / polling safepoints (HotSpot, older Go):** the compiler inserts **polls** at loop back-edges and method entries/exits. To trigger, the runtime makes a special **poll page** unreadable; the next poll faults, the signal handler parks the thread. This guarantees every thread reaches a safepoint quickly without per-poll cost in the common case (the page is readable, the poll is a cheap load).
- **Asynchronous preemption (Go 1.14+):** the runtime sends a signal (`SIGURG`) to a running goroutine. The signal handler checks whether the interrupted PC is at an **async-safe point** (one with a valid register map); if so it preempts there, otherwise it sets a flag and lets the goroutine reach a cooperative point. This solved the "tight loop never yields" problem — but it *still* requires the compiler to have emitted register maps broadly enough that most instructions are async-safe.

The senior insight: **"stop the world" is never instantaneous.** It's "ask all threads to reach a safepoint and wait for the last one." A thread stuck in a long syscall, in barrier-free C code (cgo), or in a region with no safepoint can lengthen the pause. Safepoint *latency* is a real tail-latency contributor.

### 3. Exception Handling: Zero-Cost EH and the Personality Routine

Modern C++/Rust use **table-driven (zero-cost) exceptions**: the *happy path* has no overhead — no flags pushed, no setjmp. Instead, the compiler emits **metadata**:

- **Unwind tables** (`.eh_frame`, DWARF CFI) describing, for each PC range, how to restore callee-saved registers and find the return address — enough to walk *up* the stack.
- **LSDA** (Language-Specific Data Area, `.gcc_except_table`) describing which call sites are inside `try`/have cleanups, and which handlers (`catch`/landing pads) apply.

When an exception is thrown (`throw`/`panic!`), the runtime's **unwinder** (`_Unwind_RaiseException`) walks frames using the unwind tables and, **for each frame, calls that language's personality routine** (`__gxx_personality_v0` for C++, the Rust equivalent). Two phases:

1. **Search phase:** the unwinder asks each personality routine "do you handle this?" *without* modifying state, until a handler is found. If none, terminate (and you can inspect the full stack — nothing has been run yet).
2. **Cleanup phase:** unwind again, this time the personality routine runs **cleanup landing pads** (C++ destructors, Rust `Drop`, `finally`) in each frame, until control transfers to the handler.

The compiler's obligation is to emit the tables and the landing pads; the runtime provides the unwinder and you (or the language) provide the personality routine. This is why "zero-cost" means *zero cost when no exception is thrown* — the cost is all in metadata size and in the slow throw path. (Go's `panic`/`recover` is a *different*, simpler mechanism layered on `defer` chains, not Itanium unwinding — a deliberate runtime design choice.)

### 4. Async/Await → State Machine: The Coroutine Transform

This is the marquee senior topic. An `async fn` looks like sequential code with suspension points (`.await`), but there are **no OS threads to block on** and the function must be able to **suspend and resume**. The compiler solves this with a **coroutine lowering**: it rewrites the function into a **state machine**.

Consider conceptual Rust:

```rust
async fn fetch_two(a: Url, b: Url) -> (Resp, Resp) {
    let ra = get(a).await;   // suspension point 1
    let rb = get(b).await;   // suspension point 2
    (ra, rb)
}
```

The compiler generates (conceptually) a struct and a `poll`:

```rust
enum FetchTwo {
    Start { a: Url, b: Url },
    AwaitingA { fut: GetFut, b: Url },        // saved: in-flight future + locals still needed
    AwaitingB { fut: GetFut, ra: Resp },      // saved: ra crosses the second await
    Done,
}

impl Future for FetchTwo {
    type Output = (Resp, Resp);
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<(Resp, Resp)> {
        loop {
            match *self {
                Start { a, b }       => { let fut = get(a); *self = AwaitingA { fut, b }; }
                AwaitingA { fut, b }  => match fut.poll(cx) {
                    Pending     => return Poll::Pending,     // SUSPEND: state preserved in self
                    Ready(ra)   => { let fut2 = get(b); *self = AwaitingB { fut: fut2, ra }; }
                },
                AwaitingB { fut, ra } => match fut.poll(cx) {
                    Pending     => return Poll::Pending,
                    Ready(rb)   => { let out = (ra, rb); *self = Done; return Poll::Ready(out); }
                },
                Done                  => unreachable!(),
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The key mechanics:

- **The discriminant** (the enum tag) records *which `.await` we last suspended at* — i.e., where to resume.
- **The variant's fields** are exactly the **locals live across that suspension point** (the compiler's liveness analysis determines this — the same kind of analysis used for register allocation). Locals *not* live across an await don't need saving.
- **Suspension is just returning `Pending`**; the state (the struct) is preserved by the *caller* who owns it. **Resumption is just calling `poll` again**; the `match` jumps straight back to the right state.
- **No stack is captured.** Unlike a green thread (which suspends a whole call stack), an async state machine captures only the live locals into a flat struct — that's why async tasks can be far cheaper in memory than goroutine stacks, and why this is sometimes called **stackless** coroutines (vs. **stackful** green threads).
- **The executor** (Tokio in Rust, the .NET thread pool + synchronization context in C#) owns the loop: it `poll`s the top-level future; on `Pending` it parks the task and, via the `Waker` in `cx`, the I/O reactor wakes it when the awaited resource is ready, then `poll`s again.

C# `async/await` does the same thing — the compiler builds a struct implementing a state machine (`IAsyncStateMachine`) with a `MoveNext()` method and an `int _state` field. JavaScript engines lower `async`/`await` (and generators) similarly. The transform is the same idea across languages: **straight-line code with suspension points becomes a struct + a resumable method.**

**Self-reference and `Pin`.** A saved local can be a *reference to another saved local* (e.g., a buffer and a slice into it both live across an await). Then the state machine is **self-referential** — moving it in memory would dangle the internal pointer. Rust's answer is `Pin<&mut Self>`: a contract that the future won't be moved after polling begins. This is the deepest consequence of the stackless transform leaking into the type system.

### 5. Stackless vs Stackful: Two Runtime Strategies for "Cheap Concurrency"

There are two ways a runtime gives you cheap concurrency, and the compiler's job differs:

- **Stackful (green threads / goroutines, Go, Erlang):** each task has a real (growable) stack; suspension saves the *whole* stack and the scheduler swaps in another. The compiler emits stack-growth checks and stack maps; suspension is transparent (you write blocking-looking code, e.g. `<-ch`).
- **Stackless (async/await state machines, Rust, C#, JS):** no per-task stack; suspension is a `return Pending` from a generated state machine. The compiler does the coroutine transform; suspension is *visible* in the type (`Future`, `Task`) and at call sites (`.await`).

The trade: stackful is ergonomic ("everything looks synchronous", any function can yield) but stacks cost memory and the runtime is heavier; stackless is memory-lean and runtime-light (you can run it with *no* GC) but "colors" functions (async vs sync) and leaks `Pin`/`Send` complexity into types. Rust chose stackless precisely so async needs **no runtime baked into the language** — you bring your own executor.

### 6. Runtime Startup, In Detail

The senior view of bootstrap:

```text
_start (crt0 / runtime rt0)
  └─ set up initial stack, read argc/argv/envp, align stack
  └─ TLS setup (thread-local storage base)
  └─ runtime init:
        heap/arena reservation, allocator init
        GC init (set GOGC/heap goal), spawn background GC worker
        scheduler init (allocate P's = GOMAXPROCS, create m0/g0)
        signal handlers installed (incl. async-preempt SIGURG, fault handlers)
  └─ __libc_csu_init / .init_array  → run static constructors in order
        (C++ global ctors, Go package init() after dependency topo-sort)
  └─ call main()
  └─ on return: run atexit/finalizers, flush, _exit(code)
```

Two senior implications: (1) **static initializers run single-threaded, before the scheduler is "open for business,"** so heavy or ordering-sensitive init is risky and slow; (2) **the GC and a background worker may already be running before `main`**, which is why even an idle program shows runtime threads.

---

## Real-World Analogies

**The bookmark vs. the whole reading room (stackless vs stackful).** A *stackful* coroutine is like reserving an entire reading room mid-book: when you leave, the room (stack) stays exactly as you left it, ready to resume. A *stackless* async task is like writing a single bookmark slip — "I'm on chapter 3, paragraph 2, holding these two notes" — and freeing the room entirely. The slip (state machine struct) is tiny; the room (stack) is not.

**The fire drill (safepoints).** "Stop the world" isn't a switch; it's a fire drill. You announce it (flip the poll page / send signals), and you wait at the exit until the *last* person leaves the building. One person stuck in a long phone call (a syscall, a cgo call) holds up the whole drill. The drill's duration is the slowest straggler, not the average.

**The relay race with a baton-check (write barrier).** The GC is an auditor counting who still holds a baton (pointer). Runners keep passing batons around. Every time a runner hands a baton to someone the auditor already checked off (a black object), they must shout it out (the barrier) so the auditor re-checks that person. The shout is cheap, but it must never be skipped, or a live runner gets declared finished.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1 — Lowering is the senior lens.** Every "magic" feature is a *lowering*: high-level construct → low-level code + runtime calls + metadata. Async → state machine. Exceptions → tables + personality. GC cooperation → barriers + stack maps + safepoints. Ask "what did the compiler emit?" and the magic disappears.

**Model 2 — Suspension = where do I save state?** Stackful saves the whole stack; stackless saves only cross-suspension live locals into a struct. Everything about cost, ergonomics, and `Pin` follows from *that one choice*.

**Model 3 — Metadata over checks.** Zero-cost EH and precise GC both work by emitting **metadata** consumed only on the slow path, instead of **runtime checks** on the fast path. The compiler trades binary size for runtime speed.

**Model 4 — The executor is the new scheduler.** In stackless-async land, the runtime's scheduler is the **executor** that polls futures and the **reactor** that wakes them. It plays the same role Go's G-M-P plays, but it drives compiler-generated state machines rather than stacks.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1 — A hand-written future shows what the compiler generates (Rust)

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

// This is roughly what `async { delay(); 42 }` compiles to.
struct Delay { polls: u32 }

impl Future for Delay {
    type Output = i32;
    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<i32> {
        if self.polls < 3 {
            self.polls += 1;
            cx.waker().wake_by_ref(); // ask the executor to poll us again
            Poll::Pending             // SUSPEND: our state (polls) lives in the struct
        } else {
            Poll::Ready(42)           // RESUME to completion
        }
    }
}
```

The `polls` field is a saved local that survives across suspensions — exactly what the coroutine transform does automatically for every cross-`.await` local.

### Example 2 — Why locals across an await get saved (Rust, conceptual)

```rust
async fn example(buf: Vec<u8>) -> usize {
    let header = &buf[0..4];      // borrows buf
    let n = read_more().await;    // SUSPEND here: `buf` AND `header` are live across the await
    header.len() + n              // both must have been saved in the state machine
}
```

Because `buf` and `header` (a slice into `buf`) are both live across `.await`, the generated state machine stores both — and since `header` points into `buf`, the future is **self-referential**, which is why polling requires `Pin`.

### Example 3 — The barrier is conditional on GC phase (Go, conceptual asm)

```text
; obj.next = newptr   compiles roughly to:
    MOVB    runtime·writeBarrier(SB), AX   ; load the global "barrier on?" byte
    TESTB   AX, AX
    JEQ     fast                            ; common case: GC not marking -> skip
    ; slow path: record the write for the marker
    LEAQ    obj_next(SP), DI
    MOVQ    newptr, SI
    CALL    runtime·gcWriteBarrier(SB)
fast:
    MOVQ    newptr, obj_next(SP)            ; do the actual store
```

The fast path is one load + one branch (predicted not-taken). The barrier "turns on" only while the GC marks. This is the compiler funding concurrent GC.

### Example 4 — Exceptions cost nothing until thrown (C++)

```cpp
int hot_path(int* a, int n) {
    int s = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) s += a[i]; // NO unwind code here on the happy path
    return s;                              // exception metadata lives in .eh_frame, off to the side
}

void with_cleanup() {
    std::vector<int> v(1000);   // destructor is a cleanup landing pad in the unwind table
    might_throw();              // if it throws, the unwinder runs ~v via the personality routine
}                              // happy-path return: just the normal destructor call
```

The loop pays nothing for exception support. The cost is the `.eh_frame`/`.gcc_except_table` metadata (binary size) and the slow throw path that invokes the unwinder.

### Example 5 — Go panic/recover is a different mechanism (not Itanium unwinding)

```go
func risky() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil { // recover walks the defer chain, not DWARF unwind tables
            fmt.Println("recovered:", r)
        }
    }()
    panic("boom")
}
```

Go deliberately does **not** use table-driven C++-style unwinding. `panic` unwinds the **`defer` chain** the runtime maintains per goroutine. It's simpler, integrates with goroutine stacks, and avoids the LSDA/personality machinery — a conscious runtime design choice with different trade-offs (no zero-cost happy path for `defer`, but much simpler model).

---

## Trade-offs

| Axis | Stackful (green threads) | Stackless (async state machines) |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Per-task memory** | A growable stack (KBs+) | A flat struct sized to live locals |
| **Ergonomics** | Synchronous-looking; any fn can yield | Function "coloring" (async vs sync); `.await` visible |
| **Runtime weight** | Needs scheduler + stack machinery (fat) | Can run with *no* GC; bring-your-own executor (thin-friendly) |
| **Compiler work** | Stack checks, stack maps | Coroutine transform, liveness, `Pin`/self-ref handling |
| **Suspension cost** | Save/restore stack context | Return `Pending`; state already in struct |
| **Type-system leakage** | Minimal | `Future`/`Task`, `Pin`, `Send`/`Sync` bounds |

| Axis | Table-driven EH (C++/Rust) | Defer/panic (Go) | Return-value errors (Go errors, Rust `Result`) |
|------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Happy-path cost** | Zero (metadata only) | Small per-`defer` bookkeeping | Explicit branch, but local and predictable |
| **Throw/propagate cost** | Slow (unwinder + personality) | Walk defer chain | Cheap, explicit `?`/`if err` |
| **Binary size** | Large unwind tables | Small | Small |
| **Reasoning** | Invisible control flow | Visible at defers | Fully explicit |

---

## Use Cases

- **Designing an async runtime / executor:** you must understand the state-machine contract (`poll`, `Waker`, `Pin`) the compiler emits against.
- **Embedded / `no_std` async:** stackless async runs without a GC or OS threads — pick it when you can't afford a fat runtime.
- **Diagnosing GC tail latency:** trace safepoint stalls; a goroutine stuck in cgo or a long syscall lengthens stop-the-world.
- **Auditing binary size:** unwind tables (`.eh_frame`) and reflection metadata are large; strip or shrink when targeting size-constrained deployments.
- **Choosing an error model for a library:** zero-cost EH vs explicit `Result` is a real performance/ergonomics decision driven by how the runtime implements each.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1 — Minimize locals live across `.await` (smaller futures)

```rust
// BAD: a large buffer is held across the await -> the future struct is huge.
async fn bad(data: [u8; 65536]) -> usize { let n = io().await; data.len() + n }

// BETTER: drop/scope the big value before the await so it isn't saved in the state machine.
async fn good() -> usize {
    { let data = [0u8; 65536]; let _ = use_locally(&data); } // dropped before await
    io().await
}
```

The future's size is the max set of locals live across *any* suspension point; shrinking that shrinks every task allocation.

### Pattern 2 — Keep cgo/native calls short to avoid stretching safepoints

```go
// A long-running C call holds an M and can't hit a safepoint -> lengthens stop-the-world.
// Prefer chunking native work or doing it off the hot GC path.
```

### Pattern 3 — Don't hold pointers into a future's locals across moves (respect `Pin`)

In Rust, never construct a self-referential future and then move it; pin it (`Box::pin`, `pin!`) before polling.

### Pattern 4 — Prefer explicit error returns in size/latency-critical code

When unwind tables or GC overhead matter (embedded, hot loops), `Result`/error returns give predictable cost the compiler lowers to plain branches.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Reason in lowerings.** When debugging async or EH, picture the generated state machine or unwind tables, not the source syntax.
2. **Keep futures small.** Audit cross-await live locals; large saved state inflates every task and hurts cache behavior.
3. **Measure safepoint latency, not just GC CPU.** Tail latency often comes from the last thread reaching a safepoint, not from marking cost.
4. **Choose your concurrency model deliberately.** Stackful for ergonomics and uniform yielding; stackless for memory-lean, runtime-light, embedded-friendly async.
5. **Respect `Pin` and `Send`/`Sync` as consequences, not annoyances** — they encode real invariants of the state-machine transform.
6. **Treat metadata as a cost.** Unwind tables and reflection data are part of "you pay for a runtime"; account for them in binary-size budgets.
7. **Don't put heavy work in static initializers.** They run single-threaded before `main`, before the scheduler is fully live.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Self-referential futures moved after polling = UB without `Pin`.** The whole `Pin` apparatus exists to make this a compile error.
- **`.await` inside a held lock can deadlock or block the executor thread.** Suspension returns control to the executor while the lock is held; a non-async-aware mutex must not be held across `.await`.
- **A future that never returns `Pending` and never completes starves an executor thread** (busy-poll). Mirror of the "tight loop never yields" problem, in stackless land.
- **Long syscalls / cgo extend stop-the-world** because that thread can't reach a safepoint; pure-Go preemption can't reach into C.
- **Forgetting the write barrier in hand-written assembly / unsafe code corrupts the heap** — manual stores of heap pointers must replicate the barrier or use runtime helpers.
- **Throwing across an FFI boundary is undefined** unless both sides agree on the unwinder; C++ exceptions must not propagate into C frames lacking unwind info. (FFI/interop section covers this boundary.)
- **`panic` across a cgo boundary** is similarly unsafe — Go's defer-chain unwinder doesn't understand C frames.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Async means threads under the hood." | Stackless async is a compiler-generated state machine; threads are optional and driven by an executor. |
| "`.await` blocks the thread." | It *suspends the task* and returns control to the executor; the thread runs other tasks. |
| "Exceptions are slow, so avoid `try`." | Table-driven EH is *zero-cost on the happy path*; only throwing is slow. |
| "The GC just magically knows what's live." | It needs compiler-emitted stack maps and write barriers to be correct and precise. |
| "Stop-the-world is instantaneous." | It's bounded by the slowest thread reaching a safepoint. |
| "Go uses the same unwinding as C++." | Go uses a defer-chain panic mechanism, not Itanium/DWARF unwinding. |
| "`Pin` is bureaucratic noise." | It encodes the real hazard of self-referential generated state machines. |

## Tricky Points

- **Liveness analysis decides future size.** The same dataflow analysis used for register allocation determines which locals cross a suspension point and thus what the async struct must store. Two source-equivalent rewrites can yield different future sizes.
- **The hybrid write barrier lets Go avoid re-scanning stacks.** By combining deletion + insertion barriers and keeping stacks black after one scan, Go shortens stop-the-world stack re-scanning — a barrier-design choice with direct latency consequences.
- **Async coloring is a consequence of stacklessness, not a fashion.** Because a stackless suspension only saves the *current* function's state, the *caller* must also be a state machine to propagate suspension — hence `async` propagates up the call chain ("function coloring").
- **Zero-cost EH isn't zero binary cost.** The happy path is free in time, but `.eh_frame`/LSDA tables can be a large fraction of a binary; size-constrained builds sometimes disable EH entirely.
- **Two-phase unwinding lets you get a clean stack trace before destructors run.** Phase 1 finds the handler without touching state, which is why a debugger/`std::terminate` can show the throw site intact when no handler exists.

## Test Yourself

1. State the strong tri-color invariant and explain how an insertion write barrier preserves it.
2. Why does Go use a *hybrid* write barrier, and what does it save?
3. Describe how the HotSpot poll-page mechanism brings all threads to a safepoint.
4. What are the two phases of Itanium-style unwinding, and what does the personality routine do in each?
5. Sketch the state machine the compiler generates for an `async fn` with two `.await`s. What's in the discriminant? What's in the fields?
6. Why is a stackless async task often smaller in memory than a goroutine, and what's the trade-off?
7. What is a self-referential future and why does Rust need `Pin`?
8. Why does a long cgo call lengthen a GC stop-the-world pause?

> Answers: (1) No black object points to a white object unseen; the Dijkstra insertion barrier shades the *target* gray on every pointer store so any new black→white edge is caught. (2) Hybrid (Yuasa deletion + Dijkstra insertion) keeps stacks black after one scan, so the runtime avoids re-scanning all goroutine stacks during mark termination — shorter pauses. (3) The runtime mprotects the poll page unreadable; each thread's inserted poll (a load of that page) faults; the fault handler parks the thread at a point with a valid stack map. (4) Search phase: walk frames calling each personality routine to find a handler, no state change; cleanup phase: walk again running cleanup landing pads (destructors/`finally`) until control transfers to the handler. (5) A struct/enum whose discriminant says which `.await` we suspended at (the resume point), and whose fields are the locals live across that suspension point. (6) It stores only cross-suspension live locals in a flat struct, not a whole call stack; trade-off is function coloring and `Pin`/self-reference complexity. (7) A generated state machine that holds a pointer into its own saved locals; moving it would dangle that pointer, so `Pin` guarantees it won't move after polling starts. (8) That thread is running C code with no Go safepoint, so it can't acknowledge the stop request until the call returns; stop-the-world waits for it.

## Cheat Sheet

```text
LOWERINGS (senior lens = "what did the compiler emit?")
  GC:        write barrier (conditional on mark phase) + stack maps + reachable safepoints
             tri-color invariant: no black -> white edge unseen
             Dijkstra(insertion, shade target) | Yuasa(deletion, save old) | Go = hybrid
  SAFEPOINT: poll-page fault (HotSpot/old Go)  OR  signal-based async preempt (Go 1.14+)
             stop-the-world = wait for SLOWEST thread to reach a safepoint
  EXCEPTIONS (zero-cost/table-driven, C++/Rust):
             .eh_frame (CFI) + LSDA + personality routine; phase1 search, phase2 cleanup
             Go panic/recover = walk per-goroutine DEFER chain (different mechanism)
  ASYNC -> STATE MACHINE (stackless coroutine transform):
             enum discriminant = resume point; fields = locals live across that .await
             suspend = return Pending; resume = call poll() again; executor drives + Waker wakes
             self-referential future -> needs Pin; async "colors" functions

STACKFUL (goroutine): whole stack saved, synchronous-looking, fat runtime
STACKLESS (async):    flat struct saved, .await visible, runs with NO GC (Rust embedded)

STARTUP: rt0 -> heap/GC/scheduler init + signal handlers -> .init_array/init() -> main
```

## Summary

The senior view of a runtime is the view of its **compiler-emitted lowerings**. Precise, concurrent garbage collection works because the compiler emits **write barriers** (preserving the tri-color invariant), **stack maps** (so roots are scannable and stacks relocatable), and **safepoints** (so threads can be stopped where their state is describable) — and "stop the world" is bounded by the slowest thread reaching one. Exceptions in C++/Rust are **table-driven and zero-cost on the happy path**: the compiler emits unwind tables and an LSDA, and the runtime's unwinder calls a **personality routine** in a two-phase search/cleanup walk — whereas Go deliberately uses a simpler **defer-chain** `panic` mechanism instead.

The defining senior topic is **async/await as a state machine**: the compiler's **coroutine transform** rewrites suspendable code into a struct whose **discriminant is the resume point** and whose **fields are the locals live across each suspension**; suspension is `return Pending`, resumption is another `poll`, and an **executor + reactor** (the new scheduler) drives the whole thing via `Waker`s. This **stackless** strategy saves only live locals (not a whole stack), which makes async memory-lean and **runtime-free enough to run with no GC** — the reason Rust chose it and markets "no runtime" for embedded — at the cost of function coloring and `Pin`/self-reference complexity. The opposite **stackful** strategy (goroutines) trades memory and a fatter runtime for synchronous-looking ergonomics. Across all of it, the senior habit is the same: when a high-level feature feels like magic, ask **what metadata and calls the compiler emitted against the runtime** — and the magic resolves into mechanism.

## What You Can Build

- **A hand-written future** that mimics what `async`/`.await` compiles to, with a tiny single-threaded executor and a `Waker` — proving you understand `poll`/`Pending`/`Ready`.
- **A state-machine visualizer:** take a 2–3 `.await` async function and draw the generated enum (states + saved locals) by hand, then verify saved-state size with a benchmark.
- **A safepoint-latency probe:** in Go, induce a long cgo call during GC (`GODEBUG=gctrace=1`) and observe stop-the-world stretch.
- **An unwind-table inspector:** compile a C++ program with and without exceptions (`-fno-exceptions`), compare `.eh_frame` size and binary size with `size`/`readelf`.
