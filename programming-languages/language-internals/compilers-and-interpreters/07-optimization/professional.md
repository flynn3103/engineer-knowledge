## Introduction

> Focus: **How do you run aggressive optimization as a fleet-wide build system without shipping a miscompile or a 2-hour link?**

At senior level, optimization was a property of *a* compilation: pick flags, read remarks, feed the vectorizer, avoid UB. At professional level, optimization is a property of *the organization's build*: thousands of translation units, a multi-stage pipeline (instrument → profile → rebuild → post-link), a flag policy that hundreds of engineers must not break, and a correctness regime strong enough that turning on cross-module inlining doesn't take down production. The questions change from "is this loop vectorized?" to "what is our PGO profile freshness SLO?", "does ThinLTO fit our link-time budget?", "which UB flags are mandatory fleet-wide?", and "how do we detect an optimizer-induced regression *before* a customer does?"

The highest-leverage techniques here — **ThinLTO**, **PGO**, **post-link optimization (BOLT/Propeller)** — each promise single- to low-double-digit performance percentages on large binaries, which at fleet scale is millions of dollars of compute. But each adds a *stage* to the build, a *profile artifact* to manage, and a *correctness surface* to defend. The professional skill is delivering those wins **sustainably**: reproducible builds, profile pipelines that don't go stale, flag governance that survives team turnover, and gates that catch both performance *and* correctness regressions automatically.

In one sentence: **professional optimization is the engineering and governance of an aggressively optimized build pipeline — wins measured in fleet percentages, paid for in build complexity and correctness vigilance.**

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a staff/principal engineer:** You own build flags as policy, not preference. You decide whether the org adopts PGO and how profiles flow from production back into builds. You're accountable when an optimizer assumption (UB, a stale profile, an LTO-exposed ODR bug) causes an outage. And you justify the compute/build-time cost of every optimization stage against measured, attributable wins.

This page covers: the four-stage optimized build (front-end opt → LTO → PGO → post-link); ThinLTO at scale; PGO profile pipelines (instrumented vs sampled/AutoFDO, freshness, merging); post-link optimization with BOLT/Propeller; fleet-wide flag governance (`-O` level, FP semantics, UB hardening); correctness engineering for optimized builds (sanitizers in CI, differential testing, translation validation, miscompile triage); and the cost/benefit accounting that decides what's worth running.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** `senior.md` — the pass pipeline, phase ordering, loop/IPO optimizations, LTO/PGO concepts, the UB contract.
- **Required:** Working knowledge of a real build system (Bazel, CMake/Ninja, Buck) and a CI system, including caching and reproducibility concerns.
- **Required:** Comfort with production profiling tooling (`perf`, sampling profilers, flame graphs) and reading fleet-level performance telemetry.
- **Helpful but not required:** Experience operating a service at scale where a 3% CPU regression is a budget line item.
- **Helpful but not required:** Familiarity with supply-chain/reproducible-build requirements (deterministic outputs, profile artifacts as build inputs).

You do **not** need to know:

- The internal algorithms of individual passes beyond `senior.md` — this tier is about *operating* them.
- JIT/runtime speculative optimization internals — owned by runtime-systems.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **ThinLTO** | Scalable LTO: each module emits a summary; the linker decides cross-module imports and optimizes modules in parallel. |
| **Full (monolithic) LTO** | LTO that merges all modules into one IR module before optimizing — maximal scope, poor scalability. |
| **PGO** | Profile-guided optimization — using a runtime profile to drive inlining, layout, and branch prediction. |
| **Instrumented PGO** | First build inserts counters; a training run produces an exact profile; second build consumes it. |
| **Sampled PGO / AutoFDO / CSSPGO** | Profile gathered from production via hardware sampling (`perf`/LBR), no instrumented binary needed. |
| **Profile freshness** | How well a profile matches the code/workload it's applied to; staleness degrades or reverses PGO gains. |
| **Post-link optimization (PLO)** | Re-optimizing the *linked binary* using a profile — code layout, hot/cold splitting (BOLT, Propeller). |
| **BOLT** | Binary Optimization and Layout Tool — rewrites an already-linked binary for better code layout. |
| **Propeller** | A relinking-based PLO approach using basic-block labels and a profile. |
| **Hot/cold splitting** | Moving cold code (error paths) out of hot functions to keep the i-cache dense with hot code. |
| **Flag governance** | Org-wide policy controlling `-O` level, FP semantics, and UB hardening flags. |
| **Differential testing** | Running the same inputs through differently-built binaries and comparing outputs to catch miscompiles. |
| **Translation validation** | Per-compilation proof of input/output equivalence (e.g. Alive2 for LLVM IR transforms). |
| **Reproducible build** | A build whose output is bit-identical given the same inputs (including profile artifacts). |
| **Build-time budget** | The wall-clock/compute envelope an optimized build must fit (CI latency, link time, fleet rebuild cost). |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Four-Stage Optimized Build

A maximally-optimized native build is a pipeline, not a flag:

1. **Per-module optimization** (`-O2`/`-O3`): the standard intra-module pass pipeline (`senior.md`) on each translation unit.
2. **Link-time optimization** (ThinLTO): cross-module inlining, whole-program devirtualization, IPCP across the entire binary.
3. **Profile-guided optimization** (PGO): a production/training profile steers inlining, block layout, and branch hints in stages 1–2.
4. **Post-link optimization** (BOLT/Propeller): the *linked* binary is re-laid-out using a profile — hot/cold splitting and basic-block reordering that even LTO can't do because it operates on final addresses.

These compose multiplicatively-ish (each captures wins the others can't): a large C++ service might see ~10–15% from ThinLTO, another ~10–20% from PGO, and a further ~5–10% from BOLT — but only with disciplined profiles and budgets. The professional job is sequencing these stages, feeding each the right profile, and keeping the whole thing reproducible and fast enough to ship.

### 2. ThinLTO at Scale

Full (monolithic) LTO gives the best cross-module scope but serializes the whole program through one optimizer — it doesn't fit large binaries (memory, no parallelism, no incrementality). **ThinLTO** is the scalable answer: each module emits a compact **summary** (call graph, symbol info), a fast "thin-link" phase uses the summaries to decide which functions to *import* into which modules for inlining, and then modules are optimized **in parallel** and **cacheable** per-module. You get ~80–95% of full-LTO's benefit at a fraction of the link time, with incremental rebuilds and distributed caching intact.

The professional concerns: thin-link is a serial bottleneck (watch its scaling); cross-module inlining decisions need profile data to be good (ThinLTO + PGO together is the standard high-end config); and ThinLTO *exposes* whole-program problems (ODR violations, UB hidden by translation-unit boundaries) that per-file builds masked — so adopting it is also a correctness event.

### 3. PGO Profile Pipelines

PGO lives or dies by the **profile**, and the professional problem is the *pipeline that produces and maintains it*.

- **Instrumented PGO** inserts counters, runs a representative training workload, and produces an exact profile. Accurate but requires a separate slow instrumented binary and a curated training corpus.
- **Sampled PGO / AutoFDO / CSSPGO** harvests profiles from *production* via hardware sampling (LBR/`perf`), needing no instrumented build. This is the scalable choice: production *is* the training set, and profiles refresh naturally — but sampling is lossier and needs symbolization infrastructure.

The operational issues that dominate: **freshness** (a profile from an old release applied to new code mislabels hot/cold and can *regress* performance — you need a freshness SLO and automated refresh tied to releases); **representativeness** (a profile from one tenant/region can pessimize others — sometimes you merge multiple profiles); **profile as a build input** (it must be versioned, cached, and reproducible, which complicates hermetic builds); and **the chicken-and-egg of new code** (functions with no profile fall back to static heuristics — you accept a warm-up period). PGO's headline 5–20% is real, but it's an *operational* number that depends on running the pipeline well.

### 4. Post-Link Optimization (BOLT / Propeller)

Even after LTO and PGO, the *final linked binary's* code layout is suboptimal for the i-cache and the branch predictor, because layout decisions were made before final addresses existed. **BOLT** takes the linked binary plus a `perf` profile and *rewrites* it: it reorders basic blocks so hot paths fall through, splits cold code (error handling, slow paths) into separate sections, and reorders functions to cluster hot ones — keeping the instruction cache and TLB dense with code that actually runs. Reported wins on large server binaries are commonly 5–15% on top of PGO, dominated by i-cache and iTLB miss reduction. **Propeller** achieves similar via relinking with basic-block labels, fitting build systems that prefer re-linking over binary rewriting. The trade: another pipeline stage, another profile to manage, and a binary-rewriting (or relink) step in the release path that must be correct and reproducible.

### 5. Fleet-Wide Flag Governance

At scale, optimization flags are **policy** that hundreds of engineers operate under, and the wrong default ships everywhere. The three axes:

- **`-O` level / size:** Default `-O2` for most services; `-Os`/`-Oz` for i-cache-bound or binary-size-constrained targets (often *faster* there); `-O3` only with per-target benchmark justification. The policy should *forbid* casual `-O3` and *require* measurement.
- **Floating-point semantics:** `-ffast-math` must be **off by default fleet-wide** and only enabled in isolated, numerically-tested translation units — it silently changes results (reassociation, NaN folding) and a global default has caused real correctness incidents. Prefer the granular knobs (`-ffp-contract`, `-fno-math-errno`) under explicit ownership.
- **UB hardening:** Decide org-wide which UB to *neutralize* (`-fwrapv`, `-fno-strict-aliasing`, `-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` for kernel/legacy/security-sensitive code) versus which to *exploit* (default, for max performance) — and pair the aggressive default with mandatory sanitizers in CI so the exploited UB is actually absent.

Governance means: a single source of truth for default flags, a review gate for overrides (especially `-ffast-math` and `-O3`), and documentation of *why* each non-default flag exists so it survives team turnover.

### 6. Correctness Engineering for Optimized Builds

The more aggressive the optimization, the larger the blast radius of any latent bug *or* optimizer bug — so correctness must be engineered, not assumed:

- **Sanitizers in CI as a gate:** UBSan + ASan + TSan runs (at `-O1`/`-O2`) are the precondition for trusting UB exploitation. A clean sanitizer run means the assumptions the optimizer makes about your code actually hold.
- **Differential testing:** build the same code at `-O0` and `-O2`/LTO/PGO and compare outputs on a large input corpus; a divergence is either a miscompile or (far more often) UB. Fuzzing (`libFuzzer`, OSS-Fuzz) feeds this.
- **Translation validation (Alive2):** for teams that touch the compiler or rely on cutting-edge transforms, per-transform equivalence proofs catch optimizer miscompiles that testing misses. Most orgs *consume* a compiler validated this way upstream.
- **Miscompile triage discipline:** when `-O2` "breaks," the runbook is: reproduce under sanitizers (is it our UB?), bisect the `-O` level and the pass (`-print-after-all`, `opt-bisect`), minimize with `creduce`, and only then file upstream. Reflexively dropping to `-O0` hides the bug and forfeits the performance.
- **Reproducibility:** optimized builds must be deterministic given identical inputs *including the profile artifact* — otherwise you can't bisect, can't cache, and can't trust your supply chain.

### 7. The Cost/Benefit Accounting

Every stage costs build time, infrastructure, and correctness surface; the professional decision is *which to run* based on attributable wins. Frame it as: ThinLTO (moderate link cost, broad win, mostly safe) → PGO (profile pipeline cost, large win, freshness risk) → BOLT (extra release stage, i-cache win, binary-rewrite risk). For a latency-sensitive service at fleet scale a 10% CPU win is enormous and justifies all three; for a small internal tool, plain `-O2` is the right stopping point. The discipline is *measuring the win per stage on the real workload* and not paying for complexity that doesn't move the fleet number.

---

## Real-World Analogies

**The factory retooling (four-stage build).** Per-module `-O2` is each worker optimizing their station. LTO is redesigning the *whole line* now that you can see every station at once. PGO is rebuilding the line around a week of *measured* order data. BOLT is rearranging the warehouse *after* the line is built so the fast-moving goods sit by the door. Each captures savings the others structurally cannot — and each adds a stage you must operate and keep correct.

**Profiles as weather forecasts (freshness).** PGO/BOLT decisions are bets on future traffic based on a past sample. A fresh forecast (recent production profile) is reliable; a month-old forecast applied to a changed city (new code, new workload) sends the plows to the wrong streets — you *pessimize* the routes that are actually busy. Hence freshness SLOs and automated refresh.

**Flag governance as a building code.** You don't let every contractor pick their own wiring standard. `-ffast-math` is like skipping the grounding wire — fine in one isolated, inspected circuit, catastrophic as a building-wide default. The code (policy) plus inspections (sanitizers in CI) keep the whole structure safe even as crews rotate.

**Differential testing as a control group.** Ship the change through two differently-built pipelines and compare. If the "aggressively optimized" binary disagrees with the "plain" one on the same input, you've caught either a miscompile or your own UB before a customer did — the same logic as an A/B safety control.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: Optimization at scale is a pipeline you operate, not a flag you set.** The unit of work is a multi-stage build with profile artifacts and gates, owned like any production system, with SLOs (build time, profile freshness) and incident response (miscompile triage). "Turn on `-O3`" is not a strategy.

**Model 2: Every percent is a fleet line item — and every stage is a liability.** A 5% CPU win across a fleet pays for a lot of build complexity; but each stage (LTO, PGO, BOLT) adds correctness surface and operational cost. The job is maximizing *net* win, not gross.

**Model 3: Aggressive optimization is a loan against your code's correctness.** UB exploitation, profile assumptions, and cross-module inlining all *borrow* against the assumption that your code and profiles are sound. Sanitizers, differential testing, and freshness pipelines are how you stay solvent. Skip them and the optimizer eventually calls the loan in production.

**Model 4: The default ships everywhere; design defaults for the median, gate the exceptions.** A fleet flag default touches every binary. Make the safe, measured choice the default (`-O2`, fast-math off, sanitizers required) and require *justification + review* for the aggressive overrides (`-O3`, `-ffast-math`, UB exploitation in security code).

## Code Examples

### ThinLTO + PGO, instrumented (Clang)

```bash
# Stage A: build instrumented, run training workload, merge raw profiles.
clang -O2 -fprofile-generate=prof_raw -flto=thin app.c -o app.instr
./app.instr < representative_workload          # produces prof_raw/*.profraw
llvm-profdata merge -output=app.profdata prof_raw/*.profraw

# Stage B: optimized build consuming the profile + ThinLTO.
clang -O2 -fprofile-use=app.profdata -flto=thin \
      -fuse-ld=lld app.c -o app.opt
```

ThinLTO inlines across translation units in parallel; PGO tells the inliner *which* cross-module calls are hot enough to import. The two together are the standard high-end native config.

### Sampled PGO from production (AutoFDO)

```bash
# Collect a profile from the running production binary (no instrumentation):
perf record -b -e cycles:u -o perf.data -- ./app.prod   # -b = LBR for AutoFDO
create_llvm_prof --binary=./app.prod --profile=perf.data --out=app.afdo

# Rebuild using the production-sampled profile:
clang -O2 -fprofile-sample-use=app.afdo -flto=thin app.c -o app.opt
```

Production *is* the training set; profiles refresh with each release. The cost is symbolization and sampling infrastructure, not a slow instrumented binary.

### Post-link optimization with BOLT

```bash
# 1) Build with relocations preserved so BOLT can rewrite layout:
clang -O2 -flto=thin -Wl,--emit-relocs -fuse-ld=lld app.c -o app.opt

# 2) Profile the linked binary in production:
perf record -e cycles:u -j any,u -o perf.data -- ./app.opt
perf2bolt -p perf.data -o app.bolt.fdata app.opt

# 3) Rewrite the binary for hot/cold layout:
llvm-bolt app.opt -o app.bolted -data=app.bolt.fdata \
      -reorder-blocks=ext-tsp -reorder-functions=hfsort -split-functions \
      -split-all-cold -icf=1
```

BOLT reorders basic blocks (hot fall-through), splits cold paths out of hot functions, and clusters hot functions — squeezing i-cache/iTLB wins that survive even after LTO+PGO.

### A flag-governance configuration (Bazel-style policy sketch)

```python
# //build:optimization.bzl  — the single source of truth for default flags.
DEFAULT_COPTS = [
    "-O2",
    "-fno-fast-math",                 # fast-math OFF fleet-wide
    "-fstack-protector-strong",
]
# Overrides require explicit, reviewed opt-in per target:
FASTMATH_COPTS = ["-ffp-contract=fast"]      # granular, not full -ffast-math
HARDENED_UB    = ["-fno-strict-aliasing",    # for legacy/kernel-style targets
                  "-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks"]
# CI builds a parallel sanitizer config as a correctness GATE:
SANITIZER_COPTS = ["-O1", "-fsanitize=address,undefined", "-fno-omit-frame-pointer"]
```

The policy lives in code, overrides are reviewable, and a sanitizer build runs as a gate — so the UB the production build *exploits* is provably absent.

### Differential test harness (pseudo-shell)

```bash
clang -O0            app.c -o app.O0
clang -O2 -flto=thin -fprofile-use=app.profdata app.c -o app.opt
# Replay a large corpus through both; any divergence => miscompile OR our UB.
for input in corpus/*; do
  diff <(./app.O0 < "$input") <(./app.opt < "$input") \
    || echo "DIVERGENCE on $input  (run under UBSan/ASan to classify)"
done
```

A divergence is the alarm; sanitizers classify it (your UB ~99% of the time, an optimizer miscompile rarely). Fuzzing feeds `corpus/`.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros**

- **Fleet-scale wins.** ThinLTO + PGO + BOLT stack to 20–40% CPU on large native services — millions in compute and latency budget.
- **Production-driven.** Sampled PGO/AutoFDO turns real traffic into optimization signal, self-refreshing with releases.
- **Recovered abstraction cost.** Whole-program inlining/devirtualization lets engineers write clean, layered code without paying for it at runtime.

**Cons**

- **Operational complexity.** Multi-stage builds, profile artifacts, and post-link steps are systems to own, with their own SLOs and failure modes.
- **Correctness blast radius.** Aggressive optimization weaponizes latent UB and exposes whole-program bugs (ODR) — demanding sanitizers, differential testing, and triage discipline.
- **Build-time and reproducibility cost.** LTO link time, instrumented training runs, profile management, and determinism-with-profiles all tax the pipeline.
- **Profile fragility.** Stale or unrepresentative profiles can *regress* performance; PGO/BOLT need a maintained freshness pipeline, not a one-time setup.
- **Governance overhead.** Flag policy needs ownership, review gates, and documentation to survive at organizational scale.

---

## Use Cases

- **A latency-critical fleet service.** Full stack: ThinLTO + AutoFDO + BOLT, with profile freshness tied to the release train and a sanitizer gate in CI.
- **A binary-size- or i-cache-bound target.** `-Os`/`-Oz` plus BOLT hot/cold splitting; often *faster* than `-O3` and smaller.
- **Hardening a legacy/security-sensitive codebase.** Org policy mandates `-fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks -fstack-protector` and a UBSan gate while teams pay down UB.
- **Adopting LTO for the first time.** Treat it as a correctness event: enable in CI behind a differential-test/sanitizer gate, expect to find ODR/UB bugs it surfaces.
- **Numerical kernels needing fast-math.** Isolate them in their own translation units with explicit fast-math flags and numerical regression tests; never enable fast-math globally.

---

## Coding Patterns

- **Make the optimized build a versioned pipeline artifact.** Profiles, flag policy, and post-link steps are checked-in, reviewed inputs — not tribal knowledge in a release engineer's shell history.
- **Tie profile freshness to releases.** Automate profile collection from production and refresh on each release; alert when profile age exceeds the freshness SLO.
- **Gate aggressive optimization on a clean sanitizer build.** CI runs ASan/UBSan/TSan; the production build's UB exploitation is only as safe as that gate is green.
- **Default safe, override reviewed.** `-O2` + fast-math-off + UB-hardened-where-needed as the default; `-O3`/`-ffast-math`/UB-exploitation as reviewed, justified, benchmarked overrides.
- **Measure per stage, attribute per stage.** Benchmark the delta from each of LTO, PGO, BOLT on the real workload; drop any stage whose win doesn't justify its cost.

---

## Best Practices

- **Adopt ThinLTO before full LTO, and PGO before BOLT.** Sequence by win-per-complexity; ThinLTO scales and caches, full LTO usually doesn't justify itself on large binaries.
- **Run sampled PGO (AutoFDO) over instrumented where you can.** Production traffic is the best, self-refreshing training set, and it avoids maintaining a slow instrumented binary and a synthetic corpus.
- **Keep `-ffast-math` off fleet-wide; isolate and test any exception.** This is the single most common cause of "the math changed in production." Use granular FP flags under explicit ownership.
- **Make builds reproducible including the profile.** Deterministic outputs are non-negotiable for bisection, caching, and supply-chain integrity.
- **Have a miscompile runbook.** Sanitizers → `-O`/pass bisection (`opt-bisect`, `-print-after-all`) → `creduce` → upstream report. Never resolve a suspected miscompile by silently lowering `-O`.
- **Budget build time as a first-class SLO.** LTO link time and instrumented runs can balloon CI latency; track and cap them, use distributed caching (ThinLTO is cache-friendly).

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Stale PGO/BOLT profile regressing production.** The classic operational failure: profile from an old release labels new hot code as cold and *pessimizes* it. Enforce a freshness SLO and automated refresh.
- **LTO surfacing an ODR/UB bug as a "build break."** Cross-module inlining reveals one-definition-rule violations and UB that per-file builds hid. It's not LTO breaking your code — it's LTO finding the bug. Gate adoption behind differential tests.
- **`-ffast-math` leaking via a build preset or dependency.** A default in a shared toolchain config silently reassociates FP and folds NaN checks across unrelated code. Audit the full flag set; scope fast-math to specific targets.
- **Non-reproducible optimized build defeating bisection.** If the build (or the profile) isn't deterministic, you can't isolate which change caused a regression. Pin everything, including profile artifacts.
- **BOLT/post-link step breaking on the wrong binary format or missing relocations.** PLO needs `--emit-relocs` (or BB labels) and an exact profile-binary match; a mismatch silently no-ops or corrupts layout. Verify the post-link stage in CI.
- **Sanitizer gate too weak to back the UB you exploit.** If CI runs ASan but not UBSan/TSan, the production build still exploits UB the gate doesn't catch. Match the gate's coverage to the UB you rely on being absent.
- **`-O3` shipped fleet-wide "because bigger is better."** Code bloat raises i-cache misses across the fleet — a net regression measured in aggregate even if a microbenchmark improved. Default `-O2`; require evidence for `-O3`.
- **Profile from one region/tenant pessimizing others.** A single-source profile over-fits one workload. Merge representative profiles or run per-class profiles when workloads genuinely diverge.

## Summary

At professional scale, optimization is a **production pipeline**, not a flag. The maximally-optimized native build is four stages — **per-module `-O2`/`-O3`**, **ThinLTO** (scalable, parallel, cacheable cross-module inlining/devirtualization), **PGO** (production-sampled AutoFDO preferred over instrumented), and **post-link optimization** (BOLT/Propeller for i-cache/iTLB-friendly layout) — that stack to large fleet-level CPU and latency wins. Each stage captures gains the others structurally cannot, and each adds a profile artifact, a build-time cost, and a correctness surface to operate.

The professional disciplines are: **flag governance** (default `-O2`, fast-math **off** fleet-wide, UB hardening where security demands it, aggressive overrides gated by review and benchmarks); **profile pipelines** with **freshness SLOs** so PGO/BOLT don't regress on stale data; and **correctness engineering** — sanitizers as a CI gate backing any UB exploitation, **differential testing** and fuzzing to catch miscompiles-or-UB, **translation validation** (Alive2) upstream, a miscompile **runbook** (sanitize → bisect → `creduce` → report), and **reproducible builds** including the profile. The governing mindset: every percent is a fleet line item, every stage is a liability, aggressive optimization is a loan against your code's correctness — and the safe, measured choice must be the default that ships everywhere, with the dangerous knobs gated behind justification.

The companion `interview.md` drills the conceptual, tool-specific (LLVM passes, `-O` levels, GCC, JIT, PGO/LTO), trap, and design questions; `tasks.md` puts all of it — from reading `-O2` assembly to staging an LTO+PGO+BOLT build and weaponizing/defusing a UB null check — into hands-on exercises.
