# Character & String Internals (Unicode) — Middle Level

> **Topic:** Character & String Internals (Unicode)
> **Focus:** The bits themselves. Exactly how UTF-8 packs a code point into 1–4 bytes, why UTF-16 needs surrogate pairs, what the reserved `D800–DFFF` range is, and why the BOM exists and causes trouble.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **Given a code point, what exact bytes appear in memory — and given bytes, how do you reconstruct the code point without a lookup table?**

At the junior level you learned that a string is bytes plus an encoding, and that there are four layers. Now we open the encodings and look at the actual bits. This is not academic. The difference between a self-synchronizing encoding and a fragile one, the reason `0xD800–0xDFFF` can never be a real character, the reason a 4-byte file can contain three invisible bytes at the front that break your parser — all of these live at the bit level, and a middle engineer is expected to reason about them directly.

We will cover three encodings — **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, **UTF-32** — as concrete byte transformations. We will derive UTF-8's bit pattern from scratch so that you can decode a byte sequence by hand. We will see *why* UTF-16 cannot represent every code point in 16 bits and how surrogate pairs solve that by stealing a block of the code-point space. We will see the BOM (byte order mark) and the byte-order problem it was invented for. And we will confront the consequence that ties it all together: **code-unit indexing is not code-point indexing**, which is why `"😀".length === 2` and why so much string-manipulation code is quietly broken.

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a middle engineer:** You will write parsers, serializers, protocol code, and validation logic that touch bytes. When a library hands you "invalid UTF-8," you need to know what that *means* — which byte, which rule it violated. When you debug a string that has a phantom character at the front, you need to recognize a BOM. When you reason about whether a substring operation is safe, you need to know where character boundaries fall. This is the layer where "it works" becomes "I know why it works."

The next level (`senior.md`) builds on these bytes to cover normalization, case folding, and collation — the *semantic* operations on text. This page is about the *mechanical* representation.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The junior-level model: bytes → code units → code points → graphemes; what ASCII and Unicode are.
- **Required:** Comfort with binary and hexadecimal; reading bit patterns like `1110xxxx`.
- **Required:** Knowing that a code point is written `U+` then hex, range `U+0000`–`U+10FFFF`.
- **Helpful:** Familiarity with bit masking and shifting (`&`, `|`, `<<`, `>>`).
- **Helpful:** Awareness of endianness (covered fully in the sibling topic `04-endianness-and-byte-order`).

You do **not** need: normalization, collation, or in-memory string storage internals (later levels).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Code unit** | The fixed-size unit an encoding processes: 8 bits (UTF-8), 16 bits (UTF-16), 32 bits (UTF-32). |
| **Scalar value** | A Unicode code point that is *not* a surrogate — i.e. `U+0000`–`U+D7FF` or `U+E000`–`U+10FFFF`. The set of things UTF-8/16/32 may encode. |
| **Surrogate code point** | The range `U+D800`–`U+DFFF`, permanently reserved, never a real character; used only as UTF-16 surrogate *code units*. |
| **High / lead surrogate** | A UTF-16 code unit in `0xD800`–`0xDBFF`, the first half of a pair. |
| **Low / trail surrogate** | A UTF-16 code unit in `0xDC00`–`0xDFFF`, the second half of a pair. |
| **Surrogate pair** | A high + low surrogate encoding one code point in `U+10000`–`U+10FFFF`. |
| **Continuation byte** | In UTF-8, any byte of the form `10xxxxxx`; the non-leading bytes of a multi-byte sequence. |
| **Lead byte** | In UTF-8, the first byte of a sequence: `0xxxxxxx`, `110xxxxx`, `1110xxxx`, or `11110xxx`. |
| **Overlong encoding** | An illegal UTF-8 sequence that uses more bytes than necessary for a code point (a security hazard). |
| **BOM** | Byte Order Mark, `U+FEFF`. Optional prefix signaling encoding/endianness. |
| **Self-synchronizing** | Property where you can find character boundaries from any position by inspecting bytes locally. |
| **WTF-8** | "Wobbly" UTF-8, an extension that can hold unpaired surrogates, used internally by some systems (e.g. Rust's `OsString` on Windows). |

## Core Concepts

### 1. UTF-8: the bit pattern, derived

UTF-8 distributes a code point's bits across 1 to 4 bytes using a fixed template. The number of leading `1` bits in the first byte tells you the length; continuation bytes always start `10`.

| Code point range | Bytes | Bit template |
|------------------|-------|--------------|
| `U+0000`–`U+007F` | 1 | `0xxxxxxx` |
| `U+0080`–`U+07FF` | 2 | `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx` |
| `U+0800`–`U+FFFF` | 3 | `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` |
| `U+10000`–`U+10FFFF` | 4 | `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` |

The `x` bits hold the code point, most-significant first. Worked example, `U+1F600` (😀):

```
U+1F600 = 0001 1111 0110 0000 0000  (21 bits)
Needs 4 bytes (template gives 3+6+6+6 = 21 payload bits).
Spread the bits into 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx:

  bits:    000   011111   011000   000000
  byte 0:  11110 000  = 0xF0
  byte 1:  10  011111  = 0x9F
  byte 2:  10  011000  = 0x98
  byte 3:  10  000000  = 0x80

UTF-8 of 😀 = F0 9F 98 80
```

You can decode by hand: see `0xF0` (`11110...`), so it is a 4-byte sequence; collect the 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 payload bits and reassemble. **No lookup table is needed** — the bytes are self-describing.

### 2. Why UTF-8 is self-synchronizing

Because lead bytes never look like continuation bytes (`0xxxxxxx`, `11...` vs `10xxxxxx`), you can drop into the middle of a UTF-8 stream and find the next character: skip backward or forward over `10xxxxxx` bytes until you hit a lead byte. A single corrupted or lost byte costs you *one* character, not the rest of the stream. This is a major reason UTF-8 won: it is robust to truncation, concatenation at arbitrary points, and corruption.

### 3. The 16-bit problem and surrogate pairs

UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units. But Unicode has code points up to `U+10FFFF`, which needs 21 bits — too many for one 16-bit unit. The solution: reserve a block of the BMP — `U+D800`–`U+DFFF`, 2048 code points — declare it **off-limits to real characters forever**, and use it as machinery. Code points above `U+FFFF` are encoded as two of these reserved units:

```
To encode code point C (where C ≥ 0x10000) as a surrogate pair:
  C' = C - 0x10000                  (now 0..0xFFFFF, 20 bits)
  high = 0xD800 + (C' >> 10)        (top 10 bits)  → 0xD800..0xDBFF
  low  = 0xDC00 + (C' & 0x3FF)      (bottom 10 bits) → 0xDC00..0xDFFF

Example, 😀 = U+1F600:
  C' = 0x1F600 - 0x10000 = 0x0F600 = 0000111101 1000000000
  high = 0xD800 + 0b0000111101 = 0xD83D
  low  = 0xDC00 + 0b1000000000 = 0xDE00
  UTF-16 of 😀 = D83D DE00
```

This is exactly why `"😀"` has `.length === 2` in JavaScript and Java: it is *two* 16-bit code units. The reserved range is what makes pairs unambiguous — a `0xD83D` can *only* be a high surrogate, never a standalone character, so a decoder always knows it must be followed by a low surrogate.

### 4. The `D800–DFFF` hole exists in UTF-8 too

Because surrogates are not real characters, **no valid encoding may produce them as code points**. Valid UTF-8 must never encode `U+D800`–`U+DFFF`; a 3-byte sequence that decodes to a surrogate is invalid UTF-8. This is the difference between "code points" and "Unicode scalar values": a scalar value is any code point *except* the surrogate range. Rust's `char` type is precisely a scalar value, which is why Rust strings can never contain unpaired surrogates and why `OsString` on Windows needs the WTF-8 escape hatch.

### 5. UTF-32: simple but wasteful

UTF-32 stores each code point in a fixed 32 bits. Indexing is O(1) and there are no surrogates or variable widths. But it wastes 4 bytes for an ASCII `A` and 4 bytes for everything, making it 4× larger than UTF-8 for English text. It is used internally (Python's PEP 393 may pick a 4-byte representation; some C `wchar_t` platforms) but almost never on the wire or on disk. Its one virtue — constant-time indexing — is rarely worth the memory.

### 6. The BOM (Byte Order Mark)

`U+FEFF` (zero-width no-break space) can be placed at the start of a file as a Byte Order Mark:

| Encoding | BOM bytes |
|----------|-----------|
| UTF-8 | `EF BB BF` |
| UTF-16 BE | `FE FF` |
| UTF-16 LE | `FF FE` |
| UTF-32 BE | `00 00 FE FF` |
| UTF-32 LE | `FF FE 00 00` |

For UTF-16/32, the BOM solves a real problem: a 16-bit unit can be stored big-endian or little-endian, and `FE FF` vs `FF FE` tells the reader which. For **UTF-8 the BOM is pointless** — UTF-8 has no byte-order ambiguity (its units are single bytes) — yet Windows tools love to prepend `EF BB BF`. That phantom 3-byte prefix is a frequent bug: it makes a JSON file start with invisible bytes, breaks shell scripts whose first line must be `#!/bin/sh`, and shows up as a stray `﻿` character in the parsed string.

---

## Real-World Analogies

**The variable-length address.** UTF-8 is like a postal system where the first digit of an address tells you how many digits the whole address has. A street number starting with `0` is one digit; starting with `110` means "read two boxes total." You never get lost because the structure is encoded in the data itself.

**The two-key safe (surrogate pairs).** A code point above `U+FFFF` is like a safe that needs two keys turned together. The "high" key alone (`0xD83D`) opens nothing — it is meaningless without its "low" partner (`0xDE00`). The reserved key-shapes (`D800–DFFF`) are manufactured *only* as safe keys, never as normal door keys, so there is no confusion.

**The invisible price tag (BOM).** The UTF-8 BOM is like a price sticker someone left on the inside of a gift. The gift is fine, but every time you open the box you find this little sticker (`﻿`) you have to peel off, and if you forget, your recipe (script, JSON) chokes on it.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: The first byte is a length header.** In UTF-8, look at the high bits of the first byte: `0` → 1 byte, `110` → 2, `1110` → 3, `11110` → 4, `10` → "you are not at the start, back up." This is the entire decoding state machine in one sentence.

**Model 2: Surrogates are an address-space hack.** Unicode permanently sacrificed 2048 code points (`D800–DFFF`) so that UTF-16 could address the astral planes with pairs. The cost is that those code points can never mean anything, and any text system must treat them as structural, not content.

**Model 3: Endianness is a UTF-16/32 problem, not a UTF-8 problem.** Because UTF-8's code unit is one byte, there is no "which end first" question. The BOM matters only for the wide encodings. If you only ever use UTF-8, you can mostly forget endianness exists for text.

**Model 4: "Index" usually means "code unit index."** When a language lets you write `s[5]` or `s.substring(2, 6)`, those numbers almost always count *code units* (UTF-16 units in Java/JS, bytes in Go/Rust), not code points and certainly not graphemes. Any arithmetic on string indices is arithmetic on the wrong layer unless you are sure the text is ASCII.

---

## Code Examples

### Decode UTF-8 by hand, in code

```python
def decode_utf8_first_char(b: bytes):
    """Return (code_point, num_bytes) for the first character in b."""
    b0 = b[0]
    if b0 < 0x80:                       # 0xxxxxxx
        return b0, 1
    elif b0 >> 5 == 0b110:              # 110xxxxx
        cp = (b0 & 0x1F) << 6 | (b[1] & 0x3F)
        return cp, 2
    elif b0 >> 4 == 0b1110:             # 1110xxxx
        cp = (b0 & 0x0F) << 12 | (b[1] & 0x3F) << 6 | (b[2] & 0x3F)
        return cp, 3
    elif b0 >> 3 == 0b11110:            # 11110xxx
        cp = (b0 & 0x07) << 18 | (b[1] & 0x3F) << 12 | (b[2] & 0x3F) << 6 | (b[3] & 0x3F)
        return cp, 4
    raise ValueError("invalid lead byte")

print(decode_utf8_first_char(b"\xf0\x9f\x98\x80"))  # (128512, 4)  → U+1F600 😀
print(hex(128512))                                   # 0x1f600
```

### Surrogate-pair conversion (UTF-16)

```javascript
// Encode a code point to a surrogate pair, then read it back.
function toSurrogatePair(cp) {
  if (cp <= 0xFFFF) return [cp];          // BMP: single unit
  cp -= 0x10000;
  const high = 0xD800 + (cp >> 10);
  const low  = 0xDC00 + (cp & 0x3FF);
  return [high, low];
}
console.log(toSurrogatePair(0x1F600).map(x => x.toString(16))); // ["d83d", "de00"]

// The correct, surrogate-aware way to get characters in JS:
const s = "a😀b";
console.log(s.length);                 // 4   ← code units
console.log([...s].length);            // 3   ← code points (iterator is surrogate-aware)
console.log(s.codePointAt(1).toString(16)); // "1f600"  ← reads the WHOLE pair at index 1
console.log(s.charCodeAt(1).toString(16));  // "d83d"   ← reads only the high surrogate
```

### Detecting and stripping a BOM

```python
data = open("maybe_bom.txt", "rb").read()
if data.startswith(b"\xef\xbb\xbf"):
    print("UTF-8 BOM present")
    data = data[3:]                    # strip it before parsing

# Or decode with a codec that eats the BOM if present:
text = data.decode("utf-8-sig")        # 'utf-8-sig' transparently removes a UTF-8 BOM
```

### Walking a UTF-8 string by character boundary (Rust)

```rust
let s = "a😀b";
// Byte indices of character starts:
for (i, c) in s.char_indices() {
    println!("byte {} -> {:?}", i, c);  // 0->'a'  1->'😀'  5->'b'
}
// Slicing must land on a boundary or it PANICS:
// let _ = &s[2..3];                    // panic: byte index 2 is not a char boundary
let head = &s[..1];                     // OK: "a"
let tail = &s[5..];                     // OK: "b"
```

### Validating that bytes are well-formed UTF-8

```go
import "unicode/utf8"

raw := []byte{0xF0, 0x9F, 0x98, 0x80}   // 😀
fmt.Println(utf8.Valid(raw))            // true
bad := []byte{0xC0, 0x80}               // overlong encoding of U+0000 — illegal
fmt.Println(utf8.Valid(bad))            // false
// utf8.DecodeRune returns RuneError (U+FFFD) and width 1 on invalid input:
r, size := utf8.DecodeRune(bad)
fmt.Printf("%U size=%d\n", r, size)     // U+FFFD size=1
```

## Pros & Cons

| Encoding | Width | Indexing | Endianness | ASCII-compatible | Typical use |
|----------|-------|----------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| **UTF-8** | 1–4 bytes | O(n) scan | none | yes | web, files, APIs, the default |
| **UTF-16** | 2 or 4 bytes (surrogates) | O(n) for code points | yes (BOM/known) | no | Java/JS/.NET/Windows in-memory |
| **UTF-32** | 4 bytes fixed | O(1) | yes | no | in-memory when O(1) indexing matters |

**The recurring trade-off:** O(1) indexing requires fixed width (UTF-32), which wastes memory. Compactness requires variable width (UTF-8), which costs O(n) indexing. UTF-16 is the awkward middle that gets neither: it is variable-width *and* wastes 2 bytes on ASCII *and* has an endianness problem. Its only excuse is history — Java, JavaScript, and Windows committed to it in the early 1990s when Unicode still fit in 16 bits, before the astral planes existed.

---

## Use Cases

- **Protocol and file format design:** prefer UTF-8 on the wire; it sidesteps endianness and is ASCII-compatible for headers.
- **Interop with Java/JS/Windows APIs:** know you are crossing into UTF-16 territory; expect surrogate pairs and `.length` quirks.
- **Length-prefixed binary formats:** decide explicitly whether the prefix counts bytes or characters, and document it.
- **Streaming decoders:** rely on UTF-8 self-synchronization to resume after a partial read without losing the whole stream.
- **Robust truncation/splitting:** use the standard library's boundary-aware functions; never split on a raw byte index.

---

## Coding Patterns

**Pattern 1: Length is a header, not a guess.** When parsing UTF-8 manually, read the lead byte, derive the length, then read exactly that many continuation bytes and validate each is `10xxxxxx`. Reject anything that breaks the pattern as invalid input — do not "best effort" guess.

**Pattern 2: Convert at the API boundary, not in a loop.** If you must move between UTF-8 and UTF-16 (e.g. calling a Windows API), convert the whole string once at the boundary with the platform function, not character-by-character.

**Pattern 3: Treat the BOM as a transport detail.** Strip it on read (`utf-8-sig`, or check the first 3 bytes), and do not emit it for UTF-8 unless a consumer specifically requires it.

**Pattern 4: Use `U+FFFD` for invalid input, deliberately.** The standard "replacement character" `�` (`U+FFFD`) is the conventional way to represent undecodable bytes. Decide whether your context wants to *replace* (lenient) or *reject* (strict) invalid sequences — and never silently drop bytes, which hides corruption.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Default to UTF-8 for storage and transport.** Reserve UTF-16/32 for in-memory interop where an API forces it.
2. **Never emit a UTF-8 BOM** unless a downstream consumer explicitly requires one; strip incoming BOMs.
3. **Validate untrusted UTF-8 strictly** — reject overlong encodings, surrogate-range encodings, and truncated sequences. Lenient decoders are a security surface (see `professional.md`).
4. **Use `codePointAt` / iterators, not `charCodeAt` / raw indexing**, when you need actual characters in UTF-16 languages.
5. **Remember surrogate pairs exist** in every Java/JS/.NET string operation involving emoji or astral characters.
6. **Document whether your "length" is bytes, code units, or code points** at every API boundary.
7. **Trust the standard library** for encoding/decoding; hand-rolled UTF-8 loops are a classic source of off-by-one and overlong bugs.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

**Overlong encodings.** UTF-8 requires the *shortest* encoding of a code point. `0xC0 0x80` could naively decode to `U+0000` but uses 2 bytes for something that needs 1 — it is illegal. Lenient decoders that accept it open security holes (a NUL byte smuggled past a filter that only checked for raw `0x00`). Always reject overlong forms.

**Encoding a surrogate.** A 3-byte UTF-8 sequence decoding to `U+D83D` is invalid — surrogates are not scalar values. Some sloppy serializers emit these ("CESU-8" or careless UTF-8); strict decoders must reject them.

**Lone surrogates in UTF-16.** Slicing a JS/Java string between the two units of a pair yields a string containing one unpaired surrogate. It is technically not valid Unicode text and may serialize to `U+FFFD` or throw when you try to write it as UTF-8.

**`charCodeAt` vs `codePointAt`.** `charCodeAt(i)` returns a single UTF-16 unit (a surrogate, for astral chars); `codePointAt(i)` returns the full code point if `i` is at the start of a pair. Mixing them up reads half a character.

**The phantom BOM character.** `"﻿".length === 1` and it is *invisible*. A UTF-8 file with a BOM, decoded normally, yields a string starting with `﻿`. `JSON.parse` chokes; string `==` comparisons fail; a CSV header `Name` becomes `﻿Name`. Strip it.

**Assuming UTF-16 is fixed-width.** A persistent myth: "Java/JS strings are 2 bytes per char." False since Unicode 2.0 (1996). Any code that does `for (i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) process(s.charAt(i))` and treats each `char` as a complete character is broken for emoji and astral text.

**Byte length ≠ code unit length ≠ code point count.** For `"😀"`: 4 bytes (UTF-8), 2 code units (UTF-16), 1 code point. A length check that uses one number where another is meant rejects valid input or accepts oversized input.

---

## Summary

- **UTF-8** packs a code point into 1–4 bytes with a self-describing bit template; the first byte's high bits give the length, and you can decode by hand.
- UTF-8 is **self-synchronizing** and ASCII-compatible — the reasons it won.
- **UTF-16** cannot fit `U+10000`+ in one 16-bit unit, so it uses **surrogate pairs** drawn from the permanently reserved `U+D800`–`U+DFFF` block. This is why `"😀".length === 2`.
- Surrogates are not **scalar values**; valid UTF-8 must never encode them; Rust's `char` excludes them by definition.
- **UTF-32** is fixed-width and O(1)-indexable but 4× the size; rarely used outside memory.
- The **BOM** disambiguates endianness for UTF-16/32 but is pointless and bug-prone for UTF-8.
- **Code-unit indexing is not code-point indexing** — the root cause of broken substring, reverse, and length code.

The next level, `senior.md`, leaves the byte layer and tackles *semantics*: normalization forms (NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD), case folding's locale traps, grapheme cluster segmentation, and collation.
