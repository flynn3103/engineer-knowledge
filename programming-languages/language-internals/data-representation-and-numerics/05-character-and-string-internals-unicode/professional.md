# Character & String Internals (Unicode) — Professional Level

> **Topic:** Character & String Internals (Unicode)
> **Focus:** How runtimes actually store strings in memory (JVM compact strings, Python PEP 393, SSO, ropes, interning), and how attackers weaponize Unicode (homoglyph/IDN spoofing, Trojan Source, overlong UTF-8, normalization-bypass) — with the real incidents that resulted.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **What does a string cost in memory, why do runtimes have three or four internal representations, and how does Unicode turn into a security boundary?**

Two professional concerns sit on top of everything from the earlier levels. First, **storage**: a `String` is one of the most allocated objects in any large program, and runtimes spend enormous engineering effort shrinking it — the JVM's compact strings (JEP 254) cut heap usage of many real applications by 10%+; Python's PEP 393 picks the narrowest representation per string; C++ and Rust use small-string optimization to avoid heap allocation entirely for short strings; text editors and version-control systems use ropes/cords because mutating a megabyte string by copying is unacceptable. Understanding these representations is essential when you profile memory, design a hot path that builds strings, or choose a data structure for large mutable text.

Second, **security**: every Unicode subtlety from the senior level — multiple spellings, look-alike characters, lenient decoders, bidirectional text — is an attack surface. Homoglyphs let `аpple.com` (Cyrillic `а`) impersonate `apple.com`. The Trojan Source attack uses bidi override characters to make source code *display* differently from how it *compiles*, hiding backdoors from human review. Overlong UTF-8 smuggles forbidden bytes past naive filters. Normalization mismatches between a validator and the consumer let attackers bypass input filtering. A single unhandled character once crashed every iPhone that received it. A professional treats text as untrusted input that can be adversarially constructed.

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a professional:** You will own the memory budget of a service that holds millions of strings, and you will own the security review of code that accepts names, URLs, filenames, and source from the outside world. The bugs here are not "the accent looks wrong" — they are heap blowups, account takeovers, supply-chain backdoors, and remote crashes. This is the level where text internals become a production reliability and security problem.

## Core Concepts

### 1. JVM compact strings (JEP 254)

Before Java 9, every `String` held a `char[]` — 2 bytes per character, even for pure-ASCII strings, which are the vast majority in real applications. JEP 254 changed the backing store to a `byte[]` plus a `coder` flag:

- If every character fits in Latin-1 (`U+0000`–`U+00FF`), store **1 byte per character** (`coder = LATIN1`).
- Otherwise, store **2 bytes per character** in UTF-16 (`coder = UTF16`).

For ASCII-heavy heaps this roughly halves `String` storage; Oracle measured ~10% overall heap reduction on typical workloads. The cost is a branch on `coder` in many `String` methods. Note the asymmetry: a single non-Latin-1 character (one emoji, one `日`) flips the *entire* string to 2 bytes/char — there is no per-segment mixing. This is why a log line that is 99% ASCII plus one emoji doubles its storage.

### 2. CPython PEP 393 flexible representation

CPython picks the narrowest fixed-width representation that fits the widest code point in the string:

- All chars ≤ `U+00FF` → **1 byte each** (Latin-1).
- All chars ≤ `U+FFFF` → **2 bytes each** (UCS-2).
- Any char > `U+FFFF` → **4 bytes each** (UCS-4).

`sys.getsizeof("a")` vs `sys.getsizeof("Ā")` vs `sys.getsizeof("\U0001F600")` shows three different per-character costs. Like the JVM, it is "widest character wins": one emoji in a long string promotes *all* of it to 4 bytes/char. This is why `"a" * 1000` and `"a" * 999 + "😀"` differ wildly in memory. CPython also keeps the indexing O(1) (fixed width internally) while presenting code points to the programmer — the best of both worlds at the cost of this promotion rule.

### 3. Small-String Optimization (SSO)

`std::string` in libstdc++/libc++ stores short strings (typically ≤15 or ≤22 bytes) **inline** in the object, with no heap allocation. The object is, say, 32 bytes: for short strings the bytes live in those 32; for long strings the object holds a pointer + size + capacity. This makes short-string construction allocation-free — critical for code that builds millions of small strings. Rust's `String` does *not* do SSO (it is always heap-allocated `Vec<u8>`), which is why crates like `smartstring`, `smol_str`, and `compact_str` exist; Swift's `String` does SSO for strings up to 15 UTF-8 bytes. The trade-off: a fatter string object (worse cache density when strings are long) for zero allocations when they are short.

### 4. Ropes and cords

A **rope** represents text as a balanced tree of substring fragments. Concatenation is O(1) (a new internal node), insertion and deletion in the middle are O(log n), and you never copy a megabyte to insert one character. Text editors (the classic example) and large-document systems use ropes/cords (Abseil's `Cord`, the `xi-editor` rope, JGit's variants) so that editing huge files stays responsive. The cost is that indexing and iteration are O(log n) rather than O(1), and cache locality is worse than a flat array. Contrast: most language `String` types are *immutable flat arrays*, optimized for read and share, terrible for mutate-in-place.

### 5. Immutability and interning

Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, and Go strings are **immutable**: every "modification" allocates a new string. Immutability enables safe sharing across threads, cheap substrings (in some runtimes), and **interning** — keeping one canonical copy of each distinct string so equal strings are also `==`-identical. Java's string pool interns literals (and `String.intern()` on demand); over-interning user-controlled strings is a memory leak / DoS vector because the pool historically did not collect. The trade-off of immutability is allocation churn in string-building loops, which is why every language provides a mutable builder (`StringBuilder`, `bytes.Buffer`, `String::push_str`).

### 6. Unicode as an attack surface

Every semantic subtlety becomes a weapon:

- **Homoglyph / IDN spoofing:** `аррӏе.com` (Cyrillic letters) renders like `apple.com`. Punycode (`xn--80ak6aa92e.com`) is the ASCII form, but browsers may display the Unicode form. Phishing and fake package names exploit this.
- **Trojan Source (CVE-2021-42574):** bidi override characters (`U+202E` etc.) reorder how source code *displays* without changing how it *compiles*. A reviewer sees `if (isAdmin)` but the compiler sees a comment — a hidden backdoor invisible in code review.
- **Overlong UTF-8:** encoding `/` as `0xC0 0xAF` instead of `0x2F` can slip past a path filter that only checks for the byte `0x2F`, enabling directory traversal. (The IIS "Unicode" worm of 2001 used exactly this.)
- **Normalization bypass:** a validator checks the raw string for a forbidden substring, but the downstream consumer normalizes (NFKC) first; an attacker encodes the forbidden text using compatibility characters (`＜script＞` full-width) that pass the filter and become `<script>` after normalization.
- **Case-folding bypass:** filter checks `"admin"` but the system later lowercases with a locale where `İ`→`i`, letting `admİn` through.
- **Decoder DoS / crashes:** maliciously crafted sequences (deeply nested combining marks, specific code-point combinations) have crashed renderers and parsers.

The unifying rule: **canonicalize once, early, and validate the canonical form** — never validate one representation and consume another.

## Real-World Analogies

**The expandable suitcase (PEP 393 / compact strings).** The runtime packs your string in the smallest suitcase that fits. Throw in one oversized item (an emoji) and it upgrades the *whole* suitcase to the largest size, even if everything else was tiny. That is why one emoji can quadruple a string's footprint.

**The forged signature (homoglyph).** A homoglyph attack is a forged signature where the forger uses a letter from another alphabet that looks identical. The bank teller (the user) cannot tell `а` (Cyrillic) from `a` (Latin); only the machine reading the bytes can.

**Invisible stage directions (Trojan Source).** Bidi overrides are like invisible stage directions in a script that reorder the actors' lines for the audience (the human reading the code) while the actual recorded performance (the compiler) follows the original order. The audience and the recording diverge.

**The smuggler's false-bottom crate (overlong UTF-8).** An overlong encoding is contraband hidden in a false bottom: the inspector checks the obvious compartment (the byte `0x2F`) and waves it through, while the same goods sit in a non-standard compartment (`0xC0 0xAF`) that the receiver still unpacks as the forbidden item.

---

## Mental Models

**Model 1: One wide character taxes the whole string.** Both the JVM and CPython use "widest character wins." Memory and performance characteristics of a string are dominated by its single widest code point, not its average. Profile accordingly.

**Model 2: Short strings should not allocate.** SSO and interning exist because allocation dominates the cost of small strings. In hot paths, prefer representations and builders that avoid per-string heap churn.

**Model 3: Text is untrusted input.** Treat every externally-sourced string as adversarially constructed. The question is never "is this valid?" but "what is the *worst* valid thing this could be, and what does my consumer do with it?"

**Model 4: Validate the canonical form the consumer sees.** The classic security failure is a TOCTOU between representations: validator sees form A, consumer sees form B. Normalize first, then validate, then consume — same form throughout.

**Model 5: Display ≠ semantics.** Homoglyphs and bidi attacks all exploit the gap between what a human *sees* and what the machine *processes*. Security decisions must be made on the bytes/code points, with the rendered appearance treated as untrusted.

## Code Examples

### Observing representation costs

```python
import sys
print(sys.getsizeof("a" * 100))            # ~149  (Latin-1, ~1 byte/char)
print(sys.getsizeof("Ā" * 100))       # ~274  (UCS-2, ~2 bytes/char)
print(sys.getsizeof("\U0001F600" * 100))   # ~456  (UCS-4, ~4 bytes/char)
# One emoji promotes everything:
print(sys.getsizeof("a" * 999))            # ~1048  (Latin-1)
print(sys.getsizeof("a" * 999 + "😀"))     # ~4096  (whole string now UCS-4!)
```

```java
// JVM compact strings: one non-Latin-1 char flips the backing store to UTF-16.
String ascii = "x".repeat(1000);      // byte[] of 1000 bytes (LATIN1)
String mixed = "x".repeat(999) + "あ"; // byte[] of 2000 bytes (UTF16) — doubled
// Verify via JOL (Java Object Layout) or -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal CompactStrings (default true 9+)
```

### Building strings without allocation churn

```rust
// Rust: avoid reallocations by reserving; or use a SSO crate for many small strings.
let mut s = String::with_capacity(1024);   // one allocation
for i in 0..100 { s.push_str(&i.to_string()); }

// For millions of short strings, a compact/inline type avoids per-string heap allocs:
// use compact_str::CompactString;  // inline up to 24 bytes, heap beyond
```

### Detecting a homoglyph / mixed-script identifier

```python
import unicodedata
def scripts(s):
    return {unicodedata.name(ch, "?").split()[0] for ch in s if ch.isalpha()}

print(scripts("apple"))      # {'LATIN'}
print(scripts("аpple"))      # {'CYRILLIC', 'LATIN'}  ← mixed-script: suspicious!
# Real defense: UTS #39 confusable "skeleton" + single-script restriction.
```

### Catching a Trojan Source bidi attack

```python
BIDI_CONTROLS = {0x202A,0x202B,0x202C,0x202D,0x202E,0x2066,0x2067,0x2068,0x2069}
def has_bidi_override(src: str) -> bool:
    return any(ord(ch) in BIDI_CONTROLS for ch in src)

# Linters/compilers (rustc, gcc, GitHub) now warn on these in source files.
src = "access_level = 'user' ‮ ⁦// Check if admin⁩ ⁦"
print(has_bidi_override(src))   # True — block or warn
```

### Rejecting overlong UTF-8

```go
import "unicode/utf8"
// Go's decoder rejects overlong forms automatically:
fmt.Println(utf8.Valid([]byte{0x2F}))        // true  — '/'
fmt.Println(utf8.Valid([]byte{0xC0, 0xAF}))  // false — overlong '/', correctly rejected
// NEVER hand-roll a decoder that accepts these; use the stdlib.
```

### The normalization-bypass trap

```python
import unicodedata, re
attacker = "＜script＞"        # ＜script＞ using full-width brackets
print(bool(re.search(r"<script>", attacker)))   # False — filter passes it
normalized = unicodedata.normalize("NFKC", attacker)
print(normalized)                                # "<script>"  ← becomes dangerous
# FIX: normalize FIRST, then validate the normalized string.
```

## Pros & Cons

**Compact/flexible representations (JEP 254, PEP 393)**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Large heap savings for ASCII-heavy data | "Widest char wins" — one char taxes the whole string |
| Transparent to application code | Branch on coder in hot methods; promotion copies |
| O(1) indexing preserved (CPython) | Mixed-content strings get no per-segment savings |

**SSO / interning**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero allocation for short strings; identity `==` | Fatter string object; interning user input is a DoS risk |
| Faster construction in hot paths | Interned pool may not be GC'd (historical Java) |

**Ropes / cords**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| O(log n) edit/concat on huge text | O(log n) index; worse locality than flat array |
| No giant copies on mutation | More complex; overkill for small strings |

**Strict vs lenient decoding (security)**

| Strict | Lenient |
|--------|---------|
| Rejects overlong/surrogate/truncated — safe | Accepts more inputs; interoperable with junk |
| Fewer bypass surfaces | Opens smuggling and normalization-mismatch holes |

**The core trade-off:** memory optimizations (compact, SSO, interning) trade representational complexity for footprint, and their "widest wins" / "inline limit" rules create cliffs you must profile around. Security forces a tension between *lenient* (accept the messy real world) and *strict* (reject anything weird); for any input that crosses a trust boundary, strict + canonicalize-first wins.

---

## Use Cases

- **Memory profiling of string-heavy services:** know that one emoji/CJK char flips a string's per-char cost; segment or store such fields separately.
- **High-throughput string building:** preallocate builders, use SSO-capable types for many small strings, avoid `+` in loops.
- **Large mutable documents (editors, CRDTs, VCS):** use a rope/cord, not a flat array.
- **Identity systems (usernames, domains, package names):** canonicalize (NFKC_Casefold) + confusable/single-script check before treating two strings as the same identity.
- **Any parser/validator on untrusted text:** strict UTF-8 decoding, normalize-then-validate, reject bidi controls in source/config.
- **URL/IDN handling:** compare in Punycode/ASCII form; display with confusable warnings.

---

## Coding Patterns

**Pattern 1: Canonicalize-then-validate-then-consume, all in one representation.** Eliminate the gap attackers exploit by normalizing at the trust boundary, validating the normalized form, and consuming that same form.

**Pattern 2: Single-script + confusable skeleton for identities.** Restrict identifiers to a single script (or an allowed mixed set), compute the UTS #39 confusable skeleton, and reject collisions with existing identities.

**Pattern 3: Strict decoders at the edge.** Use the standard library's strict UTF-8 validation on all untrusted bytes; map invalid input to `U+FFFD` or reject, never silently drop.

**Pattern 4: Profile-driven representation choice.** Default to the runtime's immutable string; switch to SSO/compact types or ropes only where a profiler shows allocation or copy cost dominating.

**Pattern 5: Block bidi controls in code paths.** Lint source, config, and any field rendered to other humans for bidi override / invisible characters; allow them only where genuine RTL content is expected, using isolates correctly.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Normalize before validating untrusted input;** validate and consume the same canonical form.
2. **Decode untrusted UTF-8 strictly** — reject overlong, surrogate, and truncated sequences.
3. **Canonicalize identities with NFKC_Casefold + confusable/single-script checks** to defeat homoglyph spoofing.
4. **Scan source and human-facing text for bidi overrides and invisible characters;** treat findings as suspicious.
5. **Compare/store domains in Punycode/ASCII form;** warn on confusable display.
6. **Do not intern user-controlled strings** without bounds — it is a memory-exhaustion vector.
7. **Profile string memory with the "widest char wins" rule in mind;** keep wide-character fields out of otherwise-ASCII bulk data when footprint matters.
8. **Use ropes/cords only for large mutable text;** flat immutable strings everywhere else.
9. **Pin and track your Unicode/ICU data version;** confusable and normalization tables evolve, and security decisions depend on them.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

**One emoji quadruples your memory.** A million-row table where each `name` is ASCII except a handful containing an emoji: those rows silently jump from 1 to 4 bytes/char (CPython) or 1 to 2 (JVM) — a real, surprising heap cost discovered only under profiling.

**Interning a DoS.** Calling `String.intern()` on attacker-supplied strings (or relying on a framework that does) can fill an uncollected pool and OOM the process.

**Validator/consumer normalization mismatch.** The WAF checks the raw bytes; the application NFKC-normalizes; the attacker uses compatibility characters to pass the WAF and become a payload. Same bug class as double-decoding.

**Overlong-encoding filter bypass.** Any custom byte-level filter that does not first decode-and-validate UTF-8 can be bypassed with overlong forms. This is the IIS-worm class of bug.

**Bidi in a "harmless" comment.** A pull request whose diff *looks* benign can compile to a backdoor via bidi overrides. Diff viewers that do not reveal these controls hide the attack.

**Lone surrogate serialization.** A JS string holding an unpaired surrogate (from slicing an emoji) cannot be encoded to valid UTF-8; `JSON.stringify` may emit `\uD83D` and a strict consumer rejects it.

**Replacement-character data loss.** A lenient decoder that maps bad bytes to `U+FFFD` *destroys* the original bytes; if those bytes were meaningful (a binary field misrouted through a text path), the data is gone irreversibly.

**Case-folding length change breaking buffers.** `ß`→`SS` during case-insensitive processing changes length; fixed-size buffers or column-aligned formats overflow or misalign.

---

## Real Incidents

**The "effective power" / Unicode-of-death iOS crash (2015).** A specific Arabic/Marathi text string, when received in a notification, crashed `SpringBoard` on iOS, rebooting the phone and making Messages unusable until the message was cleared. The root cause was a text-rendering bug triggered by a particular sequence of code points and combining marks. Lesson: text rendering is a code path that processes adversarial input and must be hardened; a single message can be a remote DoS.

**The Telugu character crash (2018, CVE-2018-4124).** A single Telugu grapheme cluster (a base consonant + sign joined by a virama/ZWNJ) crashed iOS and macOS apps that tried to render it — Messages, Safari, even Springboard — across iPhones and Macs. A character in a notification could brick the Messages app. Again: a grapheme that the renderer's state machine could not handle, weaponized by simply sending it.

**Spotify username canonicalization account takeover (2013).** Spotify's username canonicalization normalized Unicode inconsistently between the point of registration and the point of lookup. An attacker could register a username that canonicalized to a victim's username, then trigger a password reset that resolved to the victim's account — a normalization-mismatch account takeover. The fix was to canonicalize once, consistently, and compare canonical forms everywhere. This is the textbook real-world case for "canonicalize-then-validate, one representation."

**Trojan Source (2021, CVE-2021-42574 / CVE-2021-42694).** Researchers showed that bidi override characters in source code let an attacker make code display one way to reviewers while compiling another way, across nearly every major language and compiler. Homoglyph identifiers compounded it. The response was compiler/linter/host warnings (rustc, gcc, GitHub, and others now flag bidi controls in source). Lesson: the source code itself is untrusted text, and the gap between display and semantics is exploitable.

**IIS Unicode directory-traversal worm (2001).** Microsoft IIS decoded overlong/double-encoded UTF-8 *after* its path-security check, so `%c0%af` (overlong `/`) bypassed the filter and enabled `../` traversal and remote command execution, exploited en masse by the "Code Red"/"Nimda"-era worms. Lesson: decode and canonicalize *before* security checks, never after.

## Summary

- Runtimes store strings in **multiple representations** to save memory: JVM **compact strings** (Latin-1/UTF-16), CPython **PEP 393** (Latin-1/UCS-2/UCS-4), **SSO** for short strings, **ropes/cords** for large mutable text, and **interning** for dedup. All "widest-char-wins" schemes have a promotion cliff: one wide character taxes the whole string.
- **Immutability** enables sharing and interning but forces builders for hot loops; interning untrusted input is a DoS vector.
- **Unicode is a security boundary.** Homoglyph/IDN spoofing, **Trojan Source** bidi attacks, **overlong UTF-8**, and **normalization/case-folding bypass** all exploit the gap between representation, display, and the canonical form a consumer sees.
- The defensive discipline: **decode strictly, canonicalize once at the boundary, validate the canonical form, and make security decisions on bytes/code points — never on rendered appearance.**
- Real incidents — the iOS "effective power" and Telugu crashes, the Spotify account takeover, Trojan Source, and the IIS worm — are all direct consequences of mishandling the internals covered in this topic.

This is the deepest tier. See `interview.md` for question practice and `tasks.md` for hands-on exercises that exercise every layer from bytes to security.
