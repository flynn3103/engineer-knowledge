# Endianness & Byte Order — Middle Level

> **Topic:** Endianness & Byte Order
> **Focus:** How to *correctly* convert between byte orders, why `*(uint32_t*)buf` is a trap (alignment + strict aliasing), and the right way to read multi-byte values from a buffer.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **Knowing what endianness is isn't enough — you have to convert correctly, and the obvious way is a landmine.**

At the junior level you learned *what* endianness is: the order of bytes in a multi-byte scalar, big-endian vs little-endian, and the rule "pin an explicit byte order at every boundary." Good. Now the hard part: **doing it without introducing two of the most common low-level bugs in systems code.**

The tempting way to read a 4-byte value out of a network buffer is:

```c
uint32_t v = *(uint32_t *)(buf + offset);   // looks clean. is a bug.
```

This single line can be wrong in **three independent ways**:

1. **Endianness** — `buf` is big-endian (network order) but the cast interprets it in native (little-endian) order. Wrong number.
2. **Alignment** — `buf + offset` may not be 4-byte aligned. On some CPUs that's a fault; on others it's just slow; the C standard says it's undefined behavior.
3. **Strict aliasing** — reading bytes through a `uint32_t*` that didn't originate as a `uint32_t` violates the C/C++ aliasing rules; the optimizer is allowed to miscompile it.

This page teaches the **correct idiom** (`memcpy` + an explicit swap, or shift-and-OR), why each of the three traps exists, how byte-swapping actually works (including the CPU's `bswap` instruction and `__builtin_bswap`), and how floats, UUIDs, and bitfields each add their own endianness wrinkle.

> 🎓 **Why this matters at the middle level:** This is where you stop copying snippets and start *understanding* serialization. Every binary protocol parser, every file-format reader, every RPC codec you'll write or review hinges on getting these idioms right. The cast-the-pointer bug ships constantly — being the person who catches it in review is a real skill.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Junior tier — big/little-endian, network byte order, the "silent wrong number" failure mode.
- **Required:** Bitwise operators: shift (`<<`, `>>`), AND (`&`), OR (`|`). You'll read and write these fluently.
- **Required:** Pointers and `memcpy` in C, or the equivalent in your language.
- **Helpful:** A rough idea of what "alignment" means (an address divisible by the type's size).
- **Helpful:** Having heard the phrase "undefined behavior."

You do **not** need (yet): SIMD swaps, cache-line interactions, or the formal C++ object model — those are `senior.md`/`professional.md`.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Byte swap (bswap)** | Reversing the byte order of a value: BE↔LE. A 4-byte swap maps `b0 b1 b2 b3` → `b3 b2 b1 b0`. |
| **`bswap` instruction** | A native CPU instruction (x86 `BSWAP`, ARM `REV`) that reverses bytes of a register in one op. |
| **`__builtin_bswap16/32/64`** | GCC/Clang intrinsics that compile to the hardware swap instruction. |
| **`std::byteswap`** | C++23 standard byte-swap function (`<bit>`). |
| **Alignment** | The requirement that a value of size `N` live at an address that's a multiple of its alignment (often `N`). |
| **Unaligned access** | Reading/writing a multi-byte value at a non-aligned address. UB in C; slow or faulting on some hardware. |
| **Type punning** | Reinterpreting the bytes of one type as another type (e.g. reading a `float`'s bits as a `uint32_t`). |
| **Strict aliasing** | The C/C++ rule that an object may only be accessed through a compatible type (or `char*`). Violating it is UB. |
| **`memcpy` idiom** | The portable, alias-safe way to load/store a scalar from/to a byte buffer: `memcpy(&v, buf, sizeof v)`. |
| **`htonl`/`ntohl`** | POSIX/Winsock conversions between host and network (big-endian) order for 32-bit values. `s` variants = 16-bit. |
| **BOM** | Byte Order Mark; `U+FEFF` at the start of a UTF-16/32 stream, encoding its endianness. |
| **Middle-endian (PDP-11)** | A historical mixed order: a 32-bit value stored as two 16-bit words, words in one order, bytes within each in the other. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Byte-swapping, concretely

To convert a value between big- and little-endian you **reverse its bytes**. For a 32-bit value `0x12345678`:

```text
before:  12 34 56 78
after:   78 56 34 12
```

By hand, with shifts and masks:

```c
uint32_t bswap32(uint32_t v) {
    return ((v & 0x000000FFu) << 24) |
           ((v & 0x0000FF00u) <<  8) |
           ((v & 0x00FF0000u) >>  8) |
           ((v & 0xFF000000u) >> 24);
}
```

This is portable but verbose. Every CPU since the 1990s has a single instruction for it: x86 `BSWAP`, ARM `REV`. Compilers expose it as `__builtin_bswap32` (GCC/Clang), `_byteswap_ulong` (MSVC), and — finally standardized — `std::byteswap` in C++23. **Use the intrinsic**; the compiler emits the one-instruction version, and your code says what it means.

### 2. The crucial distinction: swap vs. convert

A naked byte swap is **unconditional** — it always reverses bytes. But you usually don't want "always swap"; you want "make this big-endian regardless of my host." Those are different:

```text
host_to_be(x):  if host is big-endian   -> do nothing
                if host is little-endian -> swap
```

`htonl` encodes exactly this conditional. On a big-endian host, `htonl` is the identity function; on little-endian it swaps. **That's why you call `htonl` and not `bswap` directly** — `htonl` does the right thing on *any* host, while a hardcoded swap would be wrong on a big-endian machine. Modern libraries (Go's `binary.BigEndian`, Rust's `to_be_bytes`) bake this conditional in so you never think about your host's endianness at all.

### 3. Trap #1 — Endianness: the pointer cast lies

```c
uint32_t v = *(uint32_t *)buf;   // interprets buf in NATIVE order
```

This reads the four bytes at `buf` using your CPU's native endianness. If `buf` holds big-endian wire data and you're on little-endian x86, `v` is byte-reversed garbage. The cast has *no knowledge* of the data's intended order — it just reinterprets raw memory. **Always convert explicitly after loading**, or better, load with an order-aware idiom.

### 4. Trap #2 — Alignment: the address might be illegal

A `uint32_t` typically must live at an address divisible by 4. But `buf + offset` is an arbitrary byte offset into a packet — `offset` could be 3, 7, 13. Dereferencing a `uint32_t*` at an unaligned address is:

- On x86: **allowed but slower** (the hardware tolerates it).
- On older ARM, SPARC, MIPS: a **bus error / SIGBUS** — your program crashes.
- In the C standard: **undefined behavior**, full stop, even on x86.

This is why `*(uint32_t*)(buf+3)` is a portability time bomb: it works on your dev laptop and crashes on an embedded target. The `memcpy` idiom (below) sidesteps it because `memcpy` handles arbitrary alignment.

### 5. Trap #3 — Strict aliasing: the optimizer may miscompile you

C and C++ assume that pointers of *different* types don't point at the same memory (except `char*`, which may alias anything). This lets the optimizer reorder and cache loads. When you do `*(uint32_t*)buf` where `buf` is a `char*`/`uint8_t*`, you're accessing a region "as a `uint32_t`" that was never created as one. That **violates strict aliasing** and is undefined behavior — the compiler is free to assume the `uint32_t` write and a nearby `char` write don't interact and reorder them, producing wrong results under `-O2`. The bug is invisible at `-O0` and appears only in optimized builds, which is the worst kind.

### 6. The fix for all three: `memcpy`

```c
uint32_t load_be32(const uint8_t *buf) {
    uint32_t v;
    memcpy(&v, buf, sizeof v);     // alias-safe, alignment-safe, no UB
    return be32toh(v);             // then convert to host order
}
```

`memcpy(&v, buf, 4)`:

- is **alias-safe** — copying through `char`-level access is always legal;
- is **alignment-safe** — `memcpy` works at any address;
- **compiles to nothing** under optimization — GCC/Clang recognize the pattern and emit a single (possibly unaligned) load, exactly as fast as the unsafe cast.

So you pay *zero* runtime cost for correctness. This is the idiom to internalize. Then layer the endianness conversion (`be32toh`, `__builtin_bswap32`, etc.) on top.

### 7. Even simpler: shift-and-OR (no host endianness involved at all)

```c
uint32_t read_be32(const uint8_t *b) {
    return ((uint32_t)b[0] << 24) | ((uint32_t)b[1] << 16) |
           ((uint32_t)b[2] <<  8) | ((uint32_t)b[3]);
}
```

This reads bytes **one at a time** (single-byte access is always aligned and always alias-legal) and assembles the value by **place value**. It is *independent of host endianness* — it produces the same big-endian interpretation on any machine, with no swap, no `htonl`, no UB. It's the most robust idiom and what most hardened parsers use. The compiler still optimizes it to a load+bswap.

### 8. Floats have endianness too

A `float` is 4 bytes, a `double` is 8 — and their bytes are ordered by the *same* endianness as integers on virtually all platforms (IEEE-754 layout, host byte order). So to serialize a float portably you **reinterpret it as an integer of the same size, then byte-swap the integer**:

```c
uint32_t bits;
memcpy(&bits, &my_float, 4);     // grab the float's bit pattern (alias-safe)
bits = htonl(bits);              // put it in big-endian
// write bits...
```

Do **not** byte-swap a `float` "as a float" — there's no such operation. Always go through its integer bit pattern. (A rare historical caveat: a few oddball architectures stored float and integer bytes in different orders, but you'll almost never meet one.)

### 9. UTF-16/32 and the BOM

Text in UTF-16 or UTF-32 is a sequence of 2- or 4-byte code units, so it has endianness. A file may start with a **BOM** (`U+FEFF`):

```text
FE FF        -> UTF-16 big-endian
FF FE        -> UTF-16 little-endian
00 00 FE FF  -> UTF-32 big-endian
FF FE 00 00  -> UTF-32 little-endian
```

If the BOM is absent, you must guess (often defaulting to big-endian per the Unicode standard, or detecting via heuristics). **UTF-8 has no endianness** and needs no BOM (though Windows tools sometimes prepend `EF BB BF` as a signature — which is *not* a byte-order mark, just an annoyance).

### 10. Bitfield order is a *separate*, also-implementation-defined problem

A C struct bitfield like `struct { unsigned a:4; unsigned b:4; };` packs sub-byte fields, and **the order in which fields fill a byte (and how they straddle byte boundaries) is implementation-defined** — *independent* of byte endianness. Two compilers, or the same compiler on BE vs LE, can lay out bitfields differently. **Never use bitfields to parse a wire protocol.** Read the byte, then extract bits with explicit shifts and masks (`(byte >> 4) & 0xF`). This gives you a layout you actually control.

---

## Real-World Analogies

**Translating a sentence vs. reversing letters.** A byte swap is like reversing the letters of a word — mechanical. But `htonl` is like a translator who knows *both* languages: if you're already speaking the target language (big-endian host), they say nothing; otherwise they translate. You want the translator, not the blind letter-reverser, because the translator is correct on any host.

**The unaligned parking spot.** Alignment is like a truck that needs a spot starting on an even meter marker. A car can park anywhere, but the truck (a `uint32_t`) parked at meter 3 either gets a ticket (slow) or can't fit at all (SIGBUS). `memcpy` is the valet who carefully loads the cargo regardless of where the truck is — it always works.

**The optimizer's assumption.** Strict aliasing is like a warehouse manager who's been told "boxes labeled INT and boxes labeled BYTE are never the same box," and reorganizes the warehouse on that assumption. If you sneak a BYTE-box and relabel it INT, the manager's optimizations corrupt your inventory. `memcpy` plays by the rules, so the manager never gets confused.

---

## Mental Models

### Model 1: "Load bytes, then interpret — two separate steps"

Reading a scalar from a buffer is always **(a)** get the raw bytes safely, then **(b)** interpret them in a known order. The unsafe cast tries to do both at once and gets both wrong. Keep them separate: `memcpy` for (a), `be32toh`/shifts for (b).

### Model 2: "Single-byte access is the safe primitive"

Every alignment, aliasing, and endianness trap evaporates when you touch memory one byte at a time. `b[0]`, `b[1]`, ... are always aligned, always alias-legal, always order-explicit. Shift-and-OR is built on this primitive — that's why it's bulletproof.

### Model 3: "`htonl` = swap *if needed*; `bswap` = swap *always*"

When you reach for a conversion, ask: do I want unconditional reversal (`bswap`) or "make it big-endian on any host" (`htonl`/`be32toh`)? At a boundary you almost always want the latter. Confusing the two is the bug that works on LE and breaks on BE.

### Model 4: "Floats ride on integers"

There is no float byte-swap. To move a float across a byte-order boundary, reinterpret its bits as an integer (via `memcpy`), swap the integer, done. Same for doubles with 64-bit integers.

---

## Code Examples

### The full, correct big-endian reader/writer (C)

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>

// Read a 32-bit big-endian value from any offset, no UB:
static uint32_t get_be32(const uint8_t *p) {
    return ((uint32_t)p[0] << 24) | ((uint32_t)p[1] << 16) |
           ((uint32_t)p[2] <<  8) | ((uint32_t)p[3]);
}

// Write a 32-bit big-endian value to any offset:
static void put_be32(uint8_t *p, uint32_t v) {
    p[0] = (uint8_t)(v >> 24);
    p[1] = (uint8_t)(v >> 16);
    p[2] = (uint8_t)(v >>  8);
    p[3] = (uint8_t)(v);
}
```

No casts, no alignment requirement, no aliasing issue, correct on every machine. This is the gold standard for hand-written parsers.

### Using the platform conversion + memcpy (C, Linux/BSD)

```c
#include <endian.h>   // be32toh, htobe32 (glibc)
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>

uint32_t load_be32(const void *buf) {
    uint32_t raw;
    memcpy(&raw, buf, sizeof raw);  // safe load in host order
    return be32toh(raw);            // convert big-endian -> host
}
```

`be32toh` is `htonl`'s clearer cousin: "big-endian 32 to host." On a big-endian host it's a no-op; on little-endian it swaps.

### `htonl`/`ntohl` for sockets (POSIX)

```c
#include <arpa/inet.h>  // htonl, ntohl, htons, ntohs

uint32_t addr_host = 0x0A000001;          // 10.0.0.1 in host order
uint32_t addr_net  = htonl(addr_host);    // big-endian for the wire
// ... send addr_net ...
uint32_t back = ntohl(addr_net);          // back to host order
```

### Go — explicit, no host-order footgun

```go
import "encoding/binary"

func loadBE32(buf []byte) uint32 { return binary.BigEndian.Uint32(buf) }
func storeBE32(v uint32) []byte {
    b := make([]byte, 4)
    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(b, v)
    return b
}
```

Go's `binary.BigEndian.Uint32` already handles unaligned slices and never assumes host order. There is no unsafe cast to misuse.

### Rust — order in the method name

```rust
fn load_be32(buf: &[u8; 4]) -> u32 { u32::from_be_bytes(*buf) }
fn store_be32(v: u32) -> [u8; 4]    { v.to_be_bytes() }

// From a &[u8] slice of unknown length, with a length check:
fn read_be32(s: &[u8]) -> Option<u32> {
    let arr: [u8; 4] = s.get(..4)?.try_into().ok()?;
    Some(u32::from_be_bytes(arr))
}
```

`from_be_bytes` takes a fixed-size array, so the length and alignment concerns are handled by the type system. There's no aliasing UB possible.

### Float serialization (correct, via integer bits)

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

void put_be_float(uint8_t *out, float f) {
    uint32_t bits;
    memcpy(&bits, &f, sizeof bits);  // reinterpret bits, alias-safe
    bits = htonl(bits);              // big-endian
    memcpy(out, &bits, sizeof bits);
}
```

```rust
// Rust makes float byte order explicit too:
let f: f32 = 3.14;
let be: [u8; 4] = f.to_be_bytes();         // big-endian bytes
let back = f32::from_be_bytes(be);
```

### The bug to recognize in review (C)

```c
// THREE bugs in one line — flag this in any code review:
struct hdr { uint32_t len; uint16_t typ; };
struct hdr *h = (struct hdr *)buf;   // cast over a wire buffer
uint32_t n = h->len;                 // native order + alignment + aliasing UB
```

The fix: read each field with `get_be32`/`get_be16` at explicit offsets. Never overlay a struct on a wire buffer.

## Pros & Cons

### `memcpy` idiom

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Alias-safe, alignment-safe, zero UB. | Slightly more verbose than a cast. |
| Optimizes to a single load — no runtime cost. | Easy to forget the *separate* endianness conversion step. |

### Shift-and-OR idiom

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Host-endianness-independent; no swap, no `htonl`. | Verbose for 64-bit values. |
| Impossible to get alignment/aliasing wrong (byte access). | Looks "low-level" to readers unfamiliar with it. |

### Pointer cast (`*(T*)buf`)

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Shortest to type. | Native-order (wrong for wire data), may fault on unaligned access, violates strict aliasing → UB. **Avoid.** |

---

## Use Cases

- **Binary protocol parsers** (DNS, TLS records, Protobuf wire, custom RPC) — read every field with a safe order-explicit accessor.
- **File-format readers/writers** — PNG (big-endian), BMP (little-endian), TIFF (either, declared by a tag), ELF/PE headers.
- **Serialization libraries** — the conversion happens once, in the codec, at the boundary.
- **Networking** — `htonl`/`ntohl` around socket-address and header fields.
- **Cross-language data exchange** — define a fixed byte order so Go, Rust, C, and Python agree.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Tiny accessor functions per width/order

Define `get_be16`, `get_be32`, `get_be64` (and `le` variants) once, in one header, and call them everywhere. Centralizing the idiom means the tricky code exists in exactly one reviewed place.

### Pattern 2: Bounds-check before every read

```c
if (offset + 4 > len) return PARSE_ERR;   // never read past the buffer
uint32_t v = get_be32(buf + offset);
offset += 4;
```

Endianness bugs and buffer-overrun bugs cluster in the same parsing code. Check length *before* every multi-byte read.

### Pattern 3: Extract bitfields with shifts, never C bitfields

```c
uint8_t flags = buf[12];
uint8_t version = (flags >> 4) & 0x0F;   // explicit, portable
uint8_t mode    =  flags       & 0x0F;
```

You control the layout; the compiler's bitfield order can't surprise you.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Never cast a struct pointer over a wire/file buffer.** Read fields individually with order-explicit accessors.
2. **Use `memcpy` (or shift-and-OR), never `*(T*)`,** to load scalars from byte buffers — kills alignment and aliasing UB at no runtime cost.
3. **Convert with order-aware functions** (`htonl`/`be32toh`/`binary.BigEndian`/`to_be_bytes`), not bare `bswap`, so the code is correct on any host.
4. **Serialize floats via their integer bit pattern**, then byte-swap the integer.
5. **Never parse protocol fields with C bitfields** — extract bits manually.
6. **Bounds-check before every multi-byte read.**
7. **Round-trip test against golden bytes** — assert the exact hex output of your serializer, not just write-then-read equality.
8. **Compile with `-Wall -Wcast-align`** and consider `-fno-strict-aliasing` only as a crutch, not a cure — fix the idiom instead.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **The cast works on your laptop, crashes on the target.** Unaligned `*(uint32_t*)` is fine on x86 and SIGBUS on ARMv5/SPARC. "Works on my machine" is not portability.
- **The `-O2`-only bug.** Strict-aliasing violations are invisible at `-O0` and miscompile at `-O2`. If a parser works in debug and breaks in release, suspect aliasing.
- **Forgetting that `htonl` is conditional.** Replacing `htonl(x)` with a hardcoded `bswap32(x)` is correct on little-endian and *wrong* on big-endian hosts. Don't.
- **Swapping a float "as a float."** There's no such thing; you must go through the integer bit pattern. Treating the float's bytes directly often invokes signaling-NaN traps or just confuses readers.
- **Mixing up 16/32/64 widths.** Calling `ntohl` (32-bit) on a 16-bit field reads two extra bytes. Match the width.
- **PDP-11 / middle-endian.** Historically, the PDP-11 stored a 32-bit value as two 16-bit words in *big-endian word order* but *little-endian byte order within each word* — `0x12345678` became `34 12 78 56`. You won't meet a PDP-11, but the term "middle-endian" survives, and *some* protocols/formats still order multi-word fields surprisingly. Read the spec.
- **BOM in the middle of a stream.** A `U+FEFF` is only a BOM at the *start*; elsewhere it's a zero-width no-break space. Strip it only at position 0.
- **Single bytes have no order.** `uint8_t`, ASCII chars, and `bool` need no conversion. Don't `htons` a byte.

## Cheat Sheet

```text
THREE TRAPS in  uint32_t v = *(uint32_t*)buf;
  1. endianness  -> native order, wrong for wire data
  2. alignment   -> UB / SIGBUS on unaligned address
  3. aliasing    -> strict-aliasing UB, -O2 miscompile

SAFE LOAD (pick one):
  memcpy(&v, buf, 4); v = be32toh(v);          // copy then convert
  v = (b[0]<<24)|(b[1]<<16)|(b[2]<<8)|b[3];    // shift-and-OR (host-independent)

CONVERT (order-aware, correct on any host):
  htonl/ntohl  (host<->net=BE, 32-bit)   htons/ntohs (16-bit)
  htobe32/be32toh (glibc <endian.h>)
  Go:   binary.BigEndian / binary.LittleEndian
  Rust: u32::to_be_bytes / from_be_bytes
  C++23: std::byteswap (unconditional swap)

SWAP vs CONVERT:  bswap = always reverse;  htonl = reverse only if host is LE

FLOATS:  memcpy float<->uint32, swap the uint32, never swap "as float"
BITFIELDS: implementation-defined order — extract with shifts, never C bitfields
BOM (UTF-16/32): FE FF = BE,  FF FE = LE.  UTF-8 = no endianness.
```

---

## Summary

- Knowing big vs little-endian isn't enough; you must **convert correctly**, and the obvious `*(uint32_t*)buf` cast is wrong in three ways: **endianness, alignment, and strict aliasing**.
- The fix is **`memcpy` then an order-aware convert**, or **shift-and-OR** — both alias-safe, alignment-safe, and free after optimization. Shift-and-OR is even host-endianness-independent.
- Use **`htonl`/`be32toh`/`binary.BigEndian`/`to_be_bytes`** (swap *if needed*), not a bare `bswap` (swap *always*), so code is correct on any host.
- **Floats ride on integers**: reinterpret bits via `memcpy`, swap the integer, never "swap a float."
- **Bitfield order is separately implementation-defined** — never parse protocols with C bitfields; use explicit shifts.
- **UTF-16/32 carry endianness (BOM); UTF-8 doesn't.**
- **Never overlay a struct on a wire buffer.** Read each field with a small, reviewed, order-explicit accessor, bounds-checked.

The next tier (`senior.md`) goes under the hood: `bswap`/`REV`/`MOVBE` instructions, SIMD bulk swapping with `PSHUFB`, compile-time endianness detection, bi-endian architectures, and designing serialization formats that are endianness-robust by construction.
