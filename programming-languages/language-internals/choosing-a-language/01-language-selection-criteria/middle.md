# Language Selection Criteria — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Language Selection Criteria** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.

## 1. Why structure beats instinct

A senior engineer's gut is often right — but a gut feeling can't be reviewed, can't be challenged, and can't be reused. When you say "let's use Go," three failure modes follow:

1. Someone with a louder voice says "no, Kotlin," and now it's a popularity contest.
2. Six months later nobody remembers *why* you chose it, so you can't tell if the reasons still hold.
3. You can't tell whether you weighed the real constraints or just reached for the familiar.

A structured decision fixes all three. It externalizes your reasoning into something **a team can inspect, attack, and agree on.** The structure doesn't make the decision *for* you — it makes the decision *honest*.

---

## 2. The weighted decision matrix

The workhorse tool. Steps:

1. **List your criteria** (the factors from `junior.md`, tailored to this project).
2. **Assign each a weight** reflecting how much it matters *here* (they should sum to 100, or use 1–5 — just be consistent).
3. **Score each candidate** on each criterion (say, 1–5).
4. **Multiply and sum.** Highest total wins — *as a starting point for discussion, not a verdict.*

Worked example — a **new payments API service**, candidates Go, Java, Node.js:

| Criterion | Weight | Go | Java | Node.js |
|---|---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Team expertise | 30 | 3 | 5 | 4 |
| Performance / concurrency | 20 | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| Ecosystem (payments, crypto libs) | 20 | 4 | 5 | 4 |
| Correctness / type safety | 15 | 4 | 5 | 2 |
| Hiring availability | 10 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Operational consistency | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 |
| **Weighted total** | **100** | **375** | **460** | **350** |

> Computation for Java: (30×5)+(20×4)+(20×5)+(15×5)+(10×4)+(5×3) = 150+80+100+75+40+15 = **460**.

Java wins here — driven mostly by **team expertise (weight 30)** and correctness, both of which a payments system rightly prizes. Note how the *weights*, not the raw scores, decided it: Go scored highest on performance, but performance was only weight 20, while the team already knew Java cold.

---

## 3. The matrix is a thinking tool, not an oracle

The number is where the conversation **starts**, not where it ends. Two disciplines keep the matrix honest:

**Sensitivity check.** Ask: "how much would a weight have to change to flip the answer?" If dropping "team expertise" from 30 to 20 makes Go win, then your decision is really *about* how much you value existing expertise — so debate *that*, explicitly, rather than the totals. A decision that flips under small weight changes is a *close call*; say so out loud.

**The gut-check override.** If the matrix says Java but every experienced person feels uneasy, the matrix is *missing a criterion*. Don't override the gut silently — find the unnamed factor ("Java's startup time hurts our serverless deploys") and add it as a row. The matrix should *capture* your judgment, not *replace* it. When the number and the gut disagree, one of them is wrong, and finding out which is the actual work.

> **Anti-pattern: reverse-engineering the matrix.** Deciding the winner first, then tuning weights until the spreadsheet agrees. This is worse than no matrix — it launders a bias as analysis. If you catch yourself nudging a weight to "make it come out right," stop: you've already decided, so just say so and defend it directly.

## 4. Criteria, expanded into checklists

Each high-level criterion hides sub-questions. When scoring, run these:

**Problem fit**
- Is there a *de facto* standard language for this domain? (ML→Python, browser→JS, embedded→C/Rust)
- Does the language's concurrency / memory / typing model match the workload's shape?

**Team expertise**
- How many people on the team are *fluent* (not just "have touched it")?
- Who reviews the code? Who carries the pager? Do *they* know it?

**Ecosystem** *(deep-dived in [`03-ecosystem-and-tooling-maturity`](../03-ecosystem-and-tooling-maturity/README.md))*
- Do mature libraries exist for your hard requirements (auth, payments, the specific DB, the specific cloud)?
- Are they actively maintained, or one-maintainer projects last touched in 2021?

**Performance** *(deep-dived in [`02-performance-vs-productivity-tradeoffs`](../02-performance-vs-productivity-tradeoffs/README.md))*
- What's the *actual* latency/throughput requirement, in numbers?
- Where will time actually be spent — CPU, I/O, network? (Often the language barely matters because you're I/O-bound.)

**Hiring & maintenance** *(deep-dived in [`07-total-cost-of-ownership-and-team-skills`](../07-total-cost-of-ownership-and-team-skills/README.md))*
- Can you hire for it in your location / budget within a reasonable window?
- What does the maintenance picture look like in 3 years?

**Risk / reversibility**
- If this choice is wrong, how hard is it to migrate out? (See [`06-migrating-between-languages`](../06-migrating-between-languages/README.md).)
- Is the language's future secure, or are you betting on a fad? (See [`08-language-longevity-and-lock-in-risk`](../08-language-longevity-and-lock-in-risk/README.md).)

## 5. Hard constraints come first — they short-circuit the matrix

Before you build any matrix, run the **deal-breaker filter**. Some requirements are binary: a language either satisfies them or it's out, no scoring needed.

```
Must run natively in the browser?          → JS / TS / WASM only.
Must produce a single static binary?        → Go, Rust, etc.; not Python/Ruby/Node.
Must call into an existing C++ engine
  with zero serialization overhead?         → C++, Rust, or a language with strong FFI.
Hard real-time, no GC pauses allowed?       → Rust, C, C++, Zig; not Java/Go/C#.
Must run on this embedded chip's toolchain? → whatever the vendor supports.
```

Apply these *first*. They often cut the field from a dozen options to two or three — and there's no point scoring "team expertise" for a language that physically cannot meet a hard requirement. **Filter, then score.**

---

## 6. Worked decision: the "default language" question

A common real scenario: your company has no standard, and three teams have each picked differently. Leadership asks for a **default backend language** to reduce sprawl. This is selection at a different altitude — you're not choosing for one service but for *the typical future service*.

The criteria shift:
- **Consistency / sprawl reduction** becomes a heavy weight (the whole point).
- **Breadth of fit** matters more than peak fit — the default must be *good enough* for many problems, not perfect for one.
- **Hiring and onboarding** dominate because the default touches everyone.
- **Performance** matters *less* — exceptional-performance services can be the *exception* that opts out.

The right answer is often a "boring," broadly-capable language (Java, Go, C#, Python) rather than the most exciting one — because a default is judged by its worst-case fit across many teams, not its best-case fit for one. **The altitude of the decision changes the weights.** Selecting for one service and selecting an org default are different problems wearing the same words.

## 7. Documenting the decision (the part people skip)

Capture the decision in an **ADR (Architecture Decision Record)** — a short, dated markdown file in the repo:

```markdown
# ADR-014: Backend language for the Payments service

## Status: Accepted (2024-03-12)

## Context
We need a language for the new payments API. Constraints: PCI-relevant,
must integrate with our Java fraud-scoring service, team is Java-heavy.

## Decision
Java (Spring Boot).

## Rationale
- Team expertise (weight 30): the on-call team is fluent in Java.
- Correctness (weight 15): strong typing + mature testing matters for payments.
- Ecosystem (weight 20): best-in-class payment & crypto libraries.
- Go scored higher on raw performance, but performance is not our bottleneck
  here (we're I/O-bound on the DB and external PSP calls).

## Consequences
- Consistent with fraud-scoring service (shared libraries, shared on-call knowledge).
- Accept slower cold-start; not deploying this on scale-to-zero serverless.
- Revisit if latency SLOs tighten below 10ms p99.
```

This single file is worth more than the matrix itself. A year later, when someone asks "why is payments in Java?", the answer is *written down, dated, and reviewable* — including the revisit trigger. The decision becomes a thing the org can *learn from* instead of re-litigate.

## 8. Common mistakes at this level

**False precision.** Presenting "Java 460, Go 375" as if the 85-point gap is meaningful. These are subjective 1–5 scores; treat the totals as *coarse* signals. A 10-point gap is a tie. Report ranges and confidence, not decimals.

**Criteria that don't discriminate.** If every candidate scores 4 on "has a package manager," that row is dead weight — it adds nothing and dilutes the criteria that *do* differ. Drop criteria where all candidates are roughly equal.

**Forgetting whose scores they are.** "Team expertise: Go = 3" — for *whom*? Score for the actual humans who'll build and maintain this, not an abstract average engineer.

**Optimizing the build, ignoring the run.** The matrix is heavy on "how nice to write" and silent on "how expensive to operate, hire, and maintain." Those long-tail costs usually dwarf the writing experience.

## 9. Quick rules

- [ ] Run the **deal-breaker filter** before any scoring — hard constraints short-circuit the matrix.
- [ ] Build a **weighted matrix**; the *weights* encode what this project actually values.
- [ ] Do a **sensitivity check** — know which weight would flip the answer, and debate *that*.
- [ ] When the **number and the gut disagree**, find the missing criterion; never override silently.
- [ ] Never **reverse-engineer** weights to justify a pre-made choice.
- [ ] **Write an ADR** with a revisit trigger. The reasoning is the deliverable, not the winner.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Language Selection Criteria** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Language Selection Criteria?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
