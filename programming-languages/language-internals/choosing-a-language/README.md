# Choosing a Language & Polyglot Architecture

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."* — Bjarne Stroustrup

Most engineers inherit their languages. You join a team, the stack is already chosen, and the question "which language?" never reaches your desk. Then one day it does — a new service, a new team, a rewrite, a startup, a platform bet — and you discover that the decision is far harder than the language-war forums made it look. This roadmap is about **making that decision well, and living with it.**

Picking a language is not a taste contest. It is a multi-year commitment that shapes your hiring market, your failure modes, your performance ceiling, your operational cost, and the speed at which your team can ship. A great language chosen for the wrong problem is a liability; a "boring" language chosen for the right one is leverage. The skill is not knowing which language is *best* — no language is — but knowing how to **reason about fit** under real constraints: people, time, money, risk, and the code you already have.

> Looking for the *internals* of how a language executes (compilers, GC, runtimes)? See Language Internals.
>
> Looking for the *paradigms* a language expresses (OO, functional, procedural)? See Programming Paradigms.
>
> Looking for how to *think* about engineering decisions in general? See Engineering Thinking — this roadmap applies that thinking to one specific, high-stakes class of decision.

## Why a Dedicated Roadmap

Language choice is the rare technical decision that is **simultaneously cheap to make and ruinously expensive to reverse.** Anyone can `npm init` or `cargo new` in thirty seconds. Undoing that choice five years and 400,000 lines later can consume an entire engineering org. The asymmetry is the whole reason this topic deserves rigor: the cost of the decision is not paid when you make it, but every day afterward.

And it is not one decision — it is a family of related ones:

- **Selection:** Given a problem, a team, and a deadline, what should we build this in?
- **Tradeoffs:** When raw performance and developer productivity pull in opposite directions, how do we choose, and how do we know we chose right?
- **Maturity:** How do we tell a thriving ecosystem from a fashionable but hollow one?
- **Composition:** When is it right to run *several* languages at once, and what does that cost?
- **Restraint:** When should we *resist* adding a new language, even a better one?
- **Migration:** When the choice was wrong — or simply outgrown — how do we move without a death-march rewrite?
- **Ownership:** Who will maintain this in five years, can we hire them, and what will they cost?
- **Longevity:** Are we betting on a language with a future, or building on something that will strand us?

These questions are **language-agnostic by design.** The frameworks here apply whether the contenders are Go vs Java, Rust vs C++, Python vs TypeScript, or a language that doesn't exist yet. The goal is judgment that outlives any specific language's moment in the sun.

| Roadmap | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| Language Internals | *How* does a language run my code? |
| Programming Paradigms | *What styles* of thinking can a language express? |
| **Choosing a Language & Polyglot** (this) | *Which* language, *when*, and at *what cost* — across the whole lifecycle? |

## How to Read This Roadmap

Each topic ships five levels plus exercises, so you can enter at your depth and climb:

| File | Audience | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| `junior.md` | New to the decision | The core idea, plain examples, the traps everyone falls into first |
| `middle.md` | Has shipped, now choosing | Concrete frameworks and worked decisions you can apply this week |
| `senior.md` | Owns the choice | The hard tradeoffs, second-order effects, where the simple rules break |
| `professional.md` | Drives it org-wide | Governance, team dynamics, organizational and economic forces |
| `interview.md` | Preparing / hiring | The questions, the answers behind the answers, what a strong response signals |
| `tasks.md` | Wants to practice | Decision exercises, scoring rubrics, and scenarios to reason through |

## The One Idea Underneath All Eight

If you take a single principle from this roadmap, take this: **the language is rarely the bottleneck, and almost never the most expensive part of the system.** The expensive parts are people, time, and the code that already exists. Most language debates are loud precisely because they are arguing about the cheap variable — syntax and benchmarks — while the costly ones — hiring, maintenance, migration, lock-in — go undiscussed.

A senior engineer flips that. They spend their scrutiny where the money is: *Who maintains this? Can we hire them? What happens when we're wrong? How do we get out?* The syntax, they've learned, you get used to in a week.
