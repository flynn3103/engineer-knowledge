# Interop & Polyglot Architectures — Senior

<!-- level-focus -->
At senior level, focus on this question:

> Which system invariant is affected by **Interop & Polyglot Architectures** under failure, load, and change?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
---

## 1. Every boundary is a cost, not a free abstraction

Junior and middle framed boundaries as *enablers* — they let languages cooperate. The senior reframe: **every language boundary is a permanent tax**, and the architecture's quality is largely a function of how few boundaries you have and how well-placed they are.

A single cross-language boundary bills you, continuously, in at least six currencies:

| Cost | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| **Serialization** | CPU + allocations on both sides of every call; the data is copied and re-encoded |
| **Type mapping** | Each side's type system must be reconciled — `null` vs `None` vs `nil`, `int64` vs JS `number`, timezones, decimals |
| **Two debuggers** | A stack trace stops at the boundary; you debug the Go half with one tool and the Python half with another, by hand |
| **Two performance models** | The latency curve, GC behavior, and failure-under-load of each side differ; "fast" means different things on each |
| **Error-handling impedance** | Exceptions, `error` return values, `Result<T,E>`, and HTTP status codes don't map cleanly onto each other |
| **On-call load** | Whoever holds the pager must understand *both* sides to diagnose a cross-boundary incident |

None of these shows up in a benchmark. All of them show up in the third year, in the form of slow incident resolution and a team that can't be fully cross-trained. The senior lens reads an architecture diagram and counts boundaries the way an accountant counts liabilities.

---

## 2. The error-handling impedance mismatch

This is the boundary cost engineers most underestimate. Each language has a *native* way to signal failure, and none of them survive a boundary intact:

```
Python   raise FraudModelError("...")        → exception, stack-unwinding
Go       return score, fmt.Errorf("...")     → multi-value return, explicit check
Rust     Err(FraudError::Timeout)            → Result<T, E>, must be handled
Java     throw new FraudException(...)        → checked/unchecked exception
HTTP     503 Service Unavailable             → status code + body
gRPC     status.Code = UNAVAILABLE           → status enum + details
```

When a Python exception crosses a gRPC boundary into Go, it does **not** arrive as a Go `error` carrying the Python stack trace. It arrives as a gRPC status code, and *someone wrote the translation* — deciding that `FraudModelError` maps to `INTERNAL` and a timeout maps to `UNAVAILABLE`. Every one of those mappings is a place where information is lost and semantics are guessed at. The retryability of an error, the distinction between "your input was bad" and "I'm overloaded," the original stack — all of it has to be deliberately encoded into the contract or it evaporates at the seam.

The discipline: **design the error model as part of the schema**, not as an afterthought. Define explicit error categories in the `.proto` (or your error envelope), decide which are retryable, and map each language's native errors onto them on purpose. A boundary with a rich, deliberate error contract is debuggable; a boundary that just propagates "something went wrong, 500" is a black hole. (See [error-handling-patterns] thinking applied across a language seam.)

---

## 3. Cross-language observability is genuinely hard

In a monoglot system, a stack trace spans the whole request. In a polyglot system, **the stack trace dies at the boundary**, and you have to *reconstruct* the causal chain across processes and languages by hand — unless you've invested in distributed tracing.

The hard parts:

- **No unified stack trace.** A request that fails deep in the Python service shows up in Go as a generic RPC error. You correlate two separate trace fragments by a request ID *if you remembered to propagate one.*
- **Trace context propagation across runtimes.** OpenTelemetry can stitch a single trace across Go → gRPC → Python *only if every language's SDK is correctly instrumented and the `traceparent` header is propagated at every hop*. One service that drops the context, and the trace breaks in two.
- **Inconsistent log formats and levels.** Go's `slog`, Python's `logging`, and Java's Logback have different defaults, structures, and severity semantics. Without a *mandated* structured-logging format (the platform team's job — see [`professional.md`](professional.md)), correlating logs across languages is archaeology.
- **N profilers, N metrics conventions.** Profiling a Go service (pprof) and a Python service (py-spy, cProfile) requires different tools and different mental models. A p99 latency spike that crosses three languages is three separate investigations stitched together.

The senior takeaway: **polyglot's real tax is paid in incident time, not request latency.** A boundary you can't observe across is a boundary you can't debug across, and at 3 a.m. that is the cost that hurts. This is why observability tooling — distributed tracing, a mandated log schema, request-ID propagation — is a *precondition* for responsible polyglot, not a nice-to-have. ([observability-stack] is the system-design treatment.)

## 4. The FFI-vs-network tradeoff, with failure modes

Middle framed FFI as "fast but sharp." The senior version weighs the *failure modes*, which is where the real decision lives:

| Dimension | Network boundary (gRPC/REST/queue) | In-process FFI (cgo/JNI/PyO3/ctypes) |
|---|---|---|
| Call overhead | µs–ms per call | nanoseconds |
| Fault isolation | **Strong** — a crash stays contained | **None** — a segfault kills the whole process |
| Memory safety | Each side keeps its own | **Lost at the seam** — manual ownership, no shared GC |
| Independent deploy | Yes | No — one binary, deploy together |
| Build complexity | Low (separate builds) | High (C toolchain, ABI, cross-compile pain) |
| Debuggability | Two processes, but isolated | One process, two memory models, two debuggers |
| Versioning | Schema evolution rules | ABI stability — far more brittle |
| Scaling | Scale each side independently | Coupled — scale the whole process |

The decisive insight is that **FFI trades fault isolation for latency.** A network boundary is a *bulkhead*: when the Python ML service OOMs, your Go API gets a clean `UNAVAILABLE` and can shed load or fall back. With FFI, when the embedded native code corrupts memory, your whole process dies — there is no bulkhead. For a system where availability matters more than the last microsecond, that asymmetry usually settles it in favor of the network.

So the FFI decision reduces to: **is the per-call overhead actually your bottleneck, *and* is the native code stable enough that you trust it inside your address space?** NumPy clears both bars (the loop is hot; the C is battle-tested). Your own evolving service almost never clears the second. When you *do* use FFI, the senior moves are: wrap the unsafe side behind a narrow, audited interface; consider running the native code in a *separate* process via a socket if isolation matters more than the last bit of speed (the "sidecar" pattern); and treat the ABI as a versioned contract, not an assumption.

## 5. Runtime-level polyglot: sharing a VM instead of a wire

There's a fourth interop model that sidesteps both the network *and* FFI: multiple languages compiled to the **same runtime**, sharing one heap, one GC, and one type system. Here, "interop" can be a plain method call with *zero* serialization, because the languages are already speaking the same bytecode.

| Runtime | Languages | Interop story |
|---|---|---|
| **JVM** | Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Groovy | All compile to JVM bytecode; a Kotlin class calls a Java class directly, no boundary |
| **.NET CLR** | C#, F#, VB.NET | All compile to IL; F# and C# interop is a normal method call |
| **GraalVM** | Java, JS, Python, Ruby, R, C/C++ (via Truffle/Sulong) | A polyglot VM; can call across languages in one context with shared objects |
| **BEAM** | Erlang, Elixir, Gleam | Share the actor runtime; near-seamless interop |

This is *real* polyglot with *almost no interop tax*. A team can write performance-sensitive code in Java and expressive business logic in Kotlin, in the same module, calling each other as if they were one language — because to the JVM, they *are*. Scala's `cats`/`zio` and Java's Spring coexist in one process. This is why "polyglot on the JVM" is so common and so cheap relative to "polyglot across the network": the boundary cost collapses to near zero.

The catch: you're polyglot only *within the runtime's gravity well.* Kotlin/Java/Scala interop is free; Kotlin-calling-Python is not — that's back to the network or FFI. And shared-runtime polyglot still has the *human* costs (two languages to hire for, review, and reason about), just not the *machine* costs. It's the cheapest form of polyglot, which is exactly why "monoglot core, polyglot edges" (see §8 and [`professional.md`](professional.md)) often means *one runtime, several languages on it.*

### WASM: the emerging universal target

**WebAssembly** is the most interesting recent development: a portable binary instruction format that Rust, C/C++, Go, and others can compile to, that runs in browsers, on edge runtimes, and in standalone hosts (Wasmtime, WasmEdge). With the **Component Model** and **WIT** (WASM Interface Types), the promise is language-agnostic components that interoperate through a typed interface *without* sharing a language *or* a network — a Rust component and a JS host exchanging typed values across a sandboxed boundary. It's not yet the universal interop layer, but it's the most credible candidate to become one, and it's why "the future of polyglot" conversations now always include WASM (more in [`professional.md`](professional.md)).

## 6. Type-system impedance across the boundary

Even with a perfect schema, type systems don't line up, and the mismatches cause real bugs:

- **Numbers.** protobuf `int64` does not survive a trip through JavaScript, whose `number` is a 64-bit float and silently loses precision above 2^53. The fix (encode large ints as strings) is a contract decision someone must make.
- **Null/absence.** Python's `None`, Go's zero-value-vs-`nil`, Rust's `Option`, JSON's `null` vs *missing key* — these encode "absence" differently, and protobuf3's "no distinction between zero and unset for scalars" famously bites teams who needed that distinction.
- **Time and decimals.** Timezone handling, monotonic vs wall clocks, and `BigDecimal`-vs-float for money all differ per language and must be pinned in the contract or you get rounding errors and off-by-one-hour bugs at the seam.
- **Strings and encodings.** UTF-8 vs UTF-16, byte strings vs text — usually fine, occasionally catastrophic with binary data.

The senior move is to **constrain the contract to the intersection of what all participating type systems represent faithfully**, and to document the mappings explicitly. The schema enforces *structure*; it does not enforce *semantics*, and semantics is where cross-language bugs hide.

---

## 7. Principled polyglot vs sprawl

Here is the judgment that separates senior architecture from a museum of languages. Two systems can both have four languages; one is principled, the other is sprawl.

**Principled polyglot** — each language earns its place against the tax:
- Python for ML — because the ecosystem is *irreplaceable*, not because someone liked it.
- TypeScript for the frontend — because the browser forces it.
- Go for the API tier — because concurrency and a static binary fit the deployment model.
- Each boundary maps to a *team boundary* or a *genuine ecosystem need*, and each is observable and contract-enforced.

**Sprawl** — languages accreted without anyone paying for the tax:
- A Ruby service here because one engineer liked Ruby in 2019 and then left.
- A Scala service that does what the Java service does, born from a hackathon.
- A Node service whose only justification is "we already had Node for the frontend."
- Boundaries that follow no team or ecosystem logic, none observable across, each a separate on-call burden.

The test for any language in your system: **"What would we lose if this were rewritten in our primary language, and is that loss worth the toolchain, hiring, and on-call tax it imposes — forever?"** If the answer is "we'd lose the entire ML ecosystem," it's principled. If the answer is "nothing, really, it's just history," it's sprawl, and you have a consolidation candidate (the migration mechanics live in [`../06-migrating-between-languages/`](../06-migrating-between-languages/README.md)).

## 8. The polyglot tax on shared infrastructure

The boundary costs in §1 are per-boundary. There's a second, *org-wide* tax that scales with the number of *distinct languages*, regardless of boundary count:

- **Shared libraries.** Your auth/logging/metrics/retry library must now exist in *every* language — or each language gets a worse, divergent copy. A bug fix in the auth logic must be ported N times.
- **CI/CD.** Every language needs its own build, test, lint, and security-scan pipeline. The matrix of "language × pipeline stage" is the platform team's standing workload.
- **Dependency & vuln management.** A `log4shell`-class CVE means auditing *every* language's dependency tree, with different tools (`pip-audit`, `govulncheck`, `npm audit`, OWASP for Java) and different remediation paths.
- **On-call.** The pager rotation must collectively cover all N languages, which either means everyone learns everything (expensive) or incidents route slowly to the one person who knows the affected language (a bus-factor risk).

This is why the senior instinct is **"minimize the number of *languages*, not just the number of services."** Twenty Go services share one toolchain, one CI template, one auth library, one on-call skill set. Five services in five languages share nothing. The cost isn't the service count — it's the *language* count, because that's what the shared-infrastructure tax keys off. The standard mitigation, "monoglot core, polyglot edges," exists precisely to keep this tax small: pick a primary language for the bulk of the system, and allow other languages only where they're *forced* (ML, frontend) — confining the tax to a few well-justified edges. The org-level machinery for governing this is the subject of [`professional.md`](professional.md).

## 9. Senior checklist

- [ ] Read every architecture diagram as a **count of language boundaries**, each a recurring liability.
- [ ] Design the **error model into the schema** — explicit categories, retryability, deliberate mapping; never "500 and a shrug."
- [ ] Treat **distributed tracing, request-ID propagation, and a mandated log schema** as *preconditions* for polyglot, not extras.
- [ ] Choose **network over FFI** unless the call is genuinely hot *and* the native code is stable enough to trust in your address space — FFI forfeits fault isolation.
- [ ] Prefer **runtime-level polyglot** (JVM/CLR) when you need multiple languages cheaply — the machine-level boundary cost is near zero.
- [ ] Pin **type-system semantics** (int64-in-JS, null/absence, time, money) in the contract; the schema enforces structure, not meaning.
- [ ] For each language, ask **"principled or sprawl?"** — what's lost if rewritten in the primary language, and is that worth the forever-tax?
- [ ] Minimize the **number of languages**, not just services — the shared-library/CI/CVE/on-call tax keys off language count.

## Apply it

1. State the system invariant that **Interop & Polyglot Architectures** must protect.
2. Mark ownership, state, and failure propagation at each boundary.
3. Compare two designs under load, dependency failure, and future change.
4. Define recovery and compatibility behavior before implementation.
5. Test the riskiest assumption with a focused experiment.

## Verify your work

- The experiment supports the design with evidence, not preference.
- Failure injection shows the blast radius and recovery path.
- Compatibility checks cover old and new callers or data.
- Operational signals reveal invariant violations and recovery progress.

## Review questions

- Which invariant must remain true when Interop & Polyglot Architectures fails?
- Where should recovery responsibility live, and why?
- Which assumption deserves an experiment before implementation?
- How can the design evolve without changing every consumer at once?
