# Interop & Polyglot Architectures — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Interop & Polyglot Architectures** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
---

## 1. The interop spectrum

Every interop choice sits somewhere on one axis: **how tightly are the two languages coupled, and how much does crossing the boundary cost?**

```
LOOSE / SAFE / SLOW                                    TIGHT / SHARP / FAST
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────►
 Message queue   REST/JSON   gRPC/protobuf   Shared memory / sockets   FFI (same process)
 (async, fire    (sync,      (sync, binary,  (custom, fast,            (a function call;
  & forget)       universal)  typed, fast)    fiddly)                   no serialization)
```

As you move right:
- **Latency drops** (no network hop, less serialization).
- **Coupling rises** (the two sides must agree on more, and deploy more carefully).
- **Blast radius grows** (a crash on one side can take down the other).
- **Operational complexity shifts** (from "two services to deploy" to "one binary, two memory models").

There is no universally correct point. The senior skill is matching the *point on the spectrum* to the *relationship between the two components*. Most of this file is about the options and where each one belongs.

---

## 2. Network boundaries: the loose-coupling default

Keeping each language in its own process and talking over the network is the default for a reason: the OS process boundary gives you **fault isolation** (one crash doesn't kill the other), **independent deployment**, and **language independence** for free. Three flavors dominate.

### REST + JSON — the universal handshake

```
POST /predict   { "features": [0.4, 1.2], "model": "fraud-v3" }
→  200 OK       { "score": 0.91, "label": "fraud" }
```

- **Pros:** every language can do it; human-readable; trivially debuggable with `curl`; works through any proxy.
- **Cons:** JSON is verbose and slow to parse; no enforced schema (a typo in a field name fails silently at runtime); text encoding of numbers loses precision and wastes bytes.
- **Use when:** the boundary is external/public, traffic is modest, or you value debuggability over raw speed.

### gRPC + protobuf — typed, binary, fast

gRPC uses **Protocol Buffers** as both the schema language and the wire format. You define the contract once, in a `.proto` file, and generate type-safe client and server stubs in *every* language:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package fraud.v1;

message PredictRequest {
  repeated double features = 1;
  string model = 2;
}
message PredictResponse {
  double score = 1;
  string label = 2;
}
service FraudScorer {
  rpc Predict(PredictRequest) returns (PredictResponse);
}
```

Run `protoc` and you get a Go client, a Python server, a TypeScript client — all from the same file. The wire format is compact binary (often 3–10× smaller than the equivalent JSON) and parsing is far cheaper.

- **Pros:** strong typing across languages; compact, fast binary encoding; streaming; the `.proto` *is* the contract and the docs.
- **Cons:** not human-readable on the wire; needs a code-gen build step; browser support requires gRPC-Web + a proxy; harder to poke at with `curl`.
- **Use when:** internal service-to-service traffic, latency or throughput matters, and you want the contract enforced by types.

### Message queues — async decoupling

Sometimes the two components shouldn't even wait for each other. The Go API drops a message on **Kafka** / **RabbitMQ** / **SQS**, and the Python worker consumes it whenever it's ready:

```
Go API  ──► [ Kafka topic: "uploads" ] ──►  Python OCR worker
            (producer)                       (consumer, at its own pace)
```

- **Pros:** maximal decoupling — producer and consumer don't need to be up at the same time; natural buffering for bursty load; the consumer language is invisible to the producer.
- **Cons:** no synchronous answer (you get a result later, or never); harder to reason about ordering and exactly-once delivery; the message schema still has to be agreed (see §4).
- **Use when:** the work is asynchronous by nature (image processing, email, ETL), or you need to absorb load spikes.

| | REST/JSON | gRPC/protobuf | Message queue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coupling | Loose | Loose | Loosest |
| Latency overhead | Medium | Low | N/A (async) |
| Schema enforced? | No (unless you add it) | Yes | Depends |
| Debuggability | Excellent | Poor (binary) | Medium |
| Best for | Public/edge APIs | Internal hot paths | Async pipelines |

## 3. In-process FFI: tight coupling, sharp edges

Sometimes the network is too slow or too clumsy. If your Python code needs to call a number-crunching routine *millions of times*, a network hop per call (~0.1–1 ms each) is a non-starter. The answer is a **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**: calling code written in another language *inside the same process*, with no serialization and no network hop — just a function call.

This is how NumPy is fast: the Python you write is a thin shell over C and Fortran routines called via FFI. The names you'll meet:

| Mechanism | Calls *into* | From |
|---|---|---|
| **ctypes / cffi** | C shared libraries (`.so`/`.dll`) | Python |
| **cgo** | C | Go |
| **JNI** (Java Native Interface) | C/C++ | Java/JVM |
| **PyO3 / rust-cpython** | Rust | Python (and back) |
| **N-API / node-gyp** | C/C++ | Node.js |
| **`extern "C"`** | exposes Rust/C++ *to* others | Rust, C++ |

A minimal `ctypes` example — Python calling a C function:

```python
import ctypes
lib = ctypes.CDLL("./libfast.so")
lib.add.argtypes = [ctypes.c_int, ctypes.c_int]
lib.add.restype  = ctypes.c_int
result = lib.add(2, 3)   # a real C function call — no network, no JSON
```

The payoff is enormous: **near-zero call overhead** and the ability to use a fast/systems language for a hot inner loop while keeping a productive language for everything else. But FFI has sharp edges that the network boundary doesn't:

**1. Memory safety crosses the boundary.** A bug in the C code (a buffer overrun, a use-after-free) doesn't throw a clean exception — it segfaults the *entire* process, taking your Python down with it. The garbage collector on one side knows nothing about memory the other side allocated; ownership of every pointer must be agreed by hand. This is the single biggest reason FFI is dangerous: you lose the safety guarantees of *both* languages at the seam.

**2. The ABI is fragile.** FFI works at the level of the **Application Binary Interface** — the exact machine-level layout of function calls and structs. Change a struct field, recompile with a different compiler, target a different CPU, and the binary contract can silently break. There's no JSON to eyeball; you get corrupted data or a crash.

**3. Build complexity explodes.** Now your build needs a C compiler, the right headers, platform-specific shared libraries, and cross-compilation toolchains. `cgo`, famously, disables Go's clean static-binary cross-compilation story and slows builds significantly. A pure-Go binary runs anywhere; a `cgo` binary drags libc along.

**4. Two memory models, two GCs, two debuggers.** You're now debugging across a boundary where one side is garbage-collected and the other is manually managed, with one debugger that understands Python and another that understands C. (Senior level goes deep on this.)

**Rule of thumb:** reach for FFI only when (a) the call is *hot* — invoked so often that per-call network overhead dominates — and (b) you're wrapping a *mature, stable* native library rather than your own evolving code. NumPy, cryptography libs, image codecs, and DB drivers are classic good FFI citizens. Your own business logic almost never is.

---

## 4. Shared schemas: the contract that makes interop safe

Whether you go network or FFI, the two languages must *agree on the shape of the data*. An informal agreement ("the response has a `score` field, I think") rots the moment one side changes. A **schema / IDL (Interface Definition Language)** turns that agreement into a machine-checked, versioned artifact.

The three you'll meet:

| Schema tech | Wire format | Strengths | Typical home |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Protocol Buffers** | Compact binary | Fast, typed, great codegen, strict field rules | gRPC, internal RPC |
| **Apache Avro** | Compact binary | Schema travels with data; excellent schema *evolution* | Kafka, big-data pipelines |
| **JSON Schema** | JSON (text) | Validates existing JSON APIs; human-readable | REST APIs, config |

The schema does three jobs at once:

1. **Single source of truth.** The `.proto` or `.avsc` file *is* the contract. Both the Go and Python sides generate their types from it, so they cannot disagree about field names or types — a whole class of integration bugs vanishes.
2. **Code generation.** One file produces idiomatic types in every language, eliminating the hand-written, drift-prone DTOs each side would otherwise maintain.
3. **Schema evolution rules.** This is the subtle, important one. A good schema system tells you which changes are *safe* (adding an optional field) and which are *breaking* (renaming, changing a type, reusing a field number). protobuf's field *numbers* exist precisely for this: the wire format keys off the number, not the name, so you can rename `model` to `model_name` without breaking old clients — but you must *never* reuse field number `2` for a different meaning.

```protobuf
message PredictResponse {
  double score = 1;
  string label = 2;
  // SAFE to add — old clients ignore unknown fields:
  string model_version = 3;
  // BREAKING — never change a field's type or reuse its number:
  // double label = 2;   // ☠️ corrupts every existing client
}
```

Without a schema, every cross-language boundary is a verbal agreement that decays. With one, the boundary is enforced at build time and can evolve without coordinated big-bang deploys. **The schema is what makes polyglot survivable, not the choice of REST vs gRPC.** (Schema and tooling maturity is also covered in [`03-ecosystem-and-tooling-maturity`](../03-ecosystem-and-tooling-maturity/README.md).)

---

## 5. Serialization is never free

Every time data crosses a network boundary, it gets **serialized** (turned into bytes) on one side and **deserialized** on the other. This costs CPU, allocations, and time — and it's easy to underestimate.

Rough orders of magnitude (illustrative, not benchmarks):

| Operation | Approx. cost |
|---|---|
| In-process function call (FFI) | nanoseconds |
| protobuf encode/decode of a small message | microseconds |
| JSON encode/decode of the same message | several× the protobuf cost |
| A localhost network round-trip | tens of microseconds |
| A cross-datacenter round-trip | milliseconds |

The lesson: if you call across a JSON network boundary in a tight loop a million times, the serialization and round-trips can dwarf the actual work. That's exactly the situation where you either (a) **batch** — send 1,000 items per request instead of one — or (b) move to FFI to delete the boundary cost entirely. A surprising number of "our service is slow" investigations end at "we're making 50 fine-grained JSON calls where we should make one batched protobuf call."

---

## 6. Choosing the boundary granularity

Where you *draw* the boundaries matters as much as the *mechanism*. Two anti-patterns sit at the extremes:

**Too fine-grained ("chatty").** You split things so small that completing one user action requires ten cross-language round-trips. Now serialization and latency dominate, and a single slow hop stalls the whole chain. The classic symptom of a network boundary placed where an in-process call belonged.

**Too coarse ("a distributed monolith").** You draw boundaries that look like services but are so tightly coupled they must always deploy together and share a database. You pay all the *costs* of a network boundary (serialization, latency, two debuggers) and get none of the *benefit* (independent deploy, fault isolation).

The heuristic: **put a boundary where the coupling is naturally low** — where the two sides change for different reasons, are owned by different teams, or genuinely need different languages. Don't put a boundary in the middle of one tightly-coupled algorithm just because you *can*. Boundaries are cheap to add at design time and brutally expensive to move later, so place them along the seams that already exist in the problem.

---

## 7. A worked decision

Your Go API needs fraud scores from a Python ML model. Which interop mechanism?

- **Message queue?** No — the API needs the score *synchronously* to decide whether to accept the transaction. Async doesn't fit.
- **FFI (embed Python in Go)?** Tempting for speed, but Python's runtime doesn't embed cleanly into Go, the GIL complicates concurrency, and a model crash would take down your API. Too sharp for this seam.
- **REST/JSON?** Works, debuggable, but you're calling it on every transaction — latency and JSON overhead matter, and you want the request/response shape *enforced* so a model change can't silently break scoring.
- **gRPC/protobuf?** ✅ Internal, hot, latency-sensitive, and you want a typed contract that both teams generate from one `.proto`. This is the textbook fit.

**Decision: gRPC with a shared `.proto`, services kept separate.** If profiling later shows the network hop itself is the bottleneck even after batching, *then* consider co-locating or FFI — but you start at the loosely-coupled end and tighten only when measurement forces you to.

---

## 8. Common mistakes at this level

**Defaulting to FFI for speed without measuring.** FFI's sharp edges (crashes, build pain, ABI fragility) are real costs paid immediately; the speed benefit only matters if the boundary was actually hot. Measure first.

**Shipping a network API with no schema.** "We'll just use JSON" works until the third silent field-name typo causes a production incident. Add JSON Schema or move to protobuf; an unenforced contract is a contract that will break.

**Reusing protobuf field numbers.** The one truly unforgivable schema sin — it corrupts every deployed client at once. Field numbers are forever.

**Chatty boundaries.** N fine-grained calls where one batched call belongs. Profile for round-trip count, not just per-call time.

**Treating serialization as free.** It's CPU and allocations on *both* sides of every call. In hot paths it's frequently the bottleneck.

---

## 9. Quick rules

- [ ] Interop is a **spectrum** from async/queue (loose, slow) to FFI (tight, fast); match the point to the coupling.
- [ ] Default to a **network boundary** (gRPC internally, REST at the edge) for the fault isolation and independent deploys.
- [ ] Use **FFI only for hot, stable native libraries** — never for your own evolving business logic. It costs you both languages' safety at the seam.
- [ ] Put a **shared schema (protobuf/Avro/JSON Schema)** on *every* cross-language boundary. The schema, not the protocol, is what makes polyglot safe.
- [ ] Learn the **schema-evolution rules** cold: add optional fields freely; never rename-by-reuse or change a field number/type.
- [ ] **Serialization is never free** — batch chatty calls, and profile round-trip count.
- [ ] Place boundaries along **natural seams of low coupling**, not in the middle of a tight algorithm.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Interop & Polyglot Architectures** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Interop & Polyglot Architectures?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
