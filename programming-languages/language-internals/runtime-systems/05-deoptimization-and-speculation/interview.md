## How to Use This File

Each question has a model answer at the depth a senior runtime/performance engineer is expected to reach. Read the question, answer aloud or in writing first, then compare. The Engine-Specific section assumes you can speak to at least two of V8, HotSpot, SpiderMonkey, and .NET — interviewers probe cross-engine understanding to separate "I memorized one blog post" from "I understand the model."

The one invariant that must survive every answer: **deoptimization is slower-but-correct; it never changes what the program computes.** If an answer ever implies otherwise, it's wrong.

## Conceptual

## Question 1

**Why does a JIT compiler need to speculate at all? Why can't it just compile correct, fast code directly?**

Because the optimizing compiler runs *while the program runs* and frequently **cannot prove** the facts it needs for fast code. To compile `a + b` in JavaScript into a single machine `ADD`, it must know both operands are integers — but `+` is fully general (numbers, strings, coercions), and nothing in the source guarantees the types. To inline a virtual call, it must know the target — but a subclass could override it. The fully-correct code that handles every possibility is slow (type dispatch, indirect calls, bounds checks everywhere). So the compiler **assumes** the common case observed via profiling, emits fast code for it, and protects each assumption with a cheap **guard**. If the guard holds, fast path; if not, **deoptimize** to slow-but-correct code. Speculation is how you get fast code from facts you can't prove.

---

## Question 2

**Walk me through the "bet, guard, deopt" pattern with a concrete example.**

Take `function add(a, b) { return a + b; }`. Profiling shows every call so far passed small integers. The engine:

- **Bets:** "`a` and `b` are always small integers."
- **Guards:** inserts cheap checks — `if (!isSmi(a)) deopt; if (!isSmi(b)) deopt;`
- **Fast path:** a single integer add, near-C speed.
- **Deopt:** if someone calls `add("x", "y")`, the `isSmi` guard fails, the optimized frame is abandoned, the runtime reconstructs the interpreter state, and execution resumes there — correctly concatenating the strings.

The guards are far cheaper than the general "what does `+` mean" logic, so as long as they pass you win big.

---

## Question 3

**What actually happens during a deoptimization, mechanically?**

The runtime is mid-execution in native code, with values in registers and optimized stack slots. On a failed guard it:

1. Stops at the deopt point (a safepoint with full metadata).
2. Reads the deopt metadata for that exact PC — HotSpot's **scope descriptors**, V8's **translation data** — which maps each physical location (register/stack slot/constant) back to its abstract bytecode-level slot.
3. Allocates one interpreter/baseline frame **per inlined scope** (an inlined chain decompresses into multiple frames).
4. Copies each live value into the right virtual local/operand-stack slot.
5. Sets each frame's bytecode index to the resume point.
6. Replaces the single optimized frame with the reconstructed frame(s).
7. Resumes in the interpreter.

The program continues identically to how it would have run un-optimized — just slower from here.

---

## Question 4

**Does deoptimization ever change the result your program computes? Justify your answer.**

No — never. This is the core invariant. The guard is specifically designed so the fast path is taken *only* when it would produce the identical result to the slow path. If there's any chance the fast path would differ, the guard fails and you fall back to code that's guaranteed correct. So you never debug "deopt gave the wrong number" — that's impossible. You only ever debug a **performance** problem: "my hot code keeps deopting and is therefore slow." Keeping this distinction sharp is itself a senior signal.

---

## Question 5

**What is a deopt loop / deopt storm, and why is it worse than no optimization at all?**

A deopt storm is when a function is optimized, deopted, re-optimized, deopted… indefinitely, never reaching stable fast code — typically because inconsistent input keeps breaking the same bet (e.g. a hot function alternately receives ints and strings). It's worse than no optimization because the runtime burns CPU *compiling* code it immediately throws away, *on top of* running the slow path. You pay the compile cost repeatedly and never collect the fast-path dividend. Un-optimized code at least runs steadily slow; a storm runs slow *and* wastes a compiler thread.

---

## Question 6

**What's the difference between eager and lazy deoptimization?**

**Eager:** a guard fails *right now*, on the running thread, in the current frame — reconstruct immediately and resume in the interpreter. It reacts to *data* (wrong type/shape/value).

**Lazy:** the runtime decides some compiled code is *no longer valid* (e.g. a newly loaded class broke a class-hierarchy assumption), but that code may be running on the stack, possibly on other threads. You can't safely rewrite a running native frame from outside, so the code is marked **not entrant** (no new entries) and active frames are arranged to deopt **when they next reach a safepoint** (usually on return). It reacts to *program structure changing*. Eager = value-domain clock; lazy = program-structure clock.

---

## Question 7

**Name the main speculative optimizations and the bet each one makes.**

- **Monomorphic inlining** — bet: this call site always resolves to one target. Enables inlining a dynamic call directly.
- **Type specialization** — bet: this operation always sees this type. Compiles `+` as an int add / string concat / double add.
- **Branch pruning** — bet: this branch is never taken. Don't compile it; trap on entry.
- **No-overflow / SMI / int32** — bet: arithmetic stays in range. Guards on overflow, deopts to a wider representation.
- **Packed-array / elements-kind** — bet: the array stays homogeneous/packed. Transitions (float, hole, object) deopt.
- **Bounds/range elimination** — bet: index stays in bounds. Out-of-range deopts to the checked form.
- **Non-null** — bet: this reference is never null. A null deopts.

Every one is "compile the common case, leave a described escape route for the rest."

---

## Question 8

**What is scalar replacement, and what does it have to do with deopt?**

If escape analysis proves an object never escapes a method, **scalar replacement** deletes the allocation and keeps the object's fields in registers — no heap object exists, GC pressure drops. The deopt connection: a deopt point *after* the deletion may reconstruct an interpreter state that references the object as a real thing (the un-optimized bytecode has it on the stack). So the deoptimizer must **materialize / reify** the object on the spot — allocate it and copy the scalar field values back in — handing the interpreter a reference indistinguishable from a normally-created one. It's the most subtle reconstruction: an object that never existed at runtime is conjured exactly when reality demands it. Semantics preserved, as always.

---

## Question 9

**What is the role of safepoints in deoptimization?**

A safepoint is a location where the runtime can pause a thread in a fully-describable state — every live value and object reference is known. The runtime can only deopt (or GC) at safepoints, because reconstruction needs that complete description. Deopt points *are* safepoints. This is why eager deopt can reconstruct (the guard sits at a point with full metadata), why lazy deopt works (a *not entrant* frame deopts when it returns to a safepoint), and why the GC and deoptimizer share infrastructure (OopMaps recording live references). A consequence: optimization is *bounded* by the need to keep state describable at every safepoint.

---

## Question 10

**Why is keeping a call site "monomorphic" so valuable?**

A monomorphic site (only one receiver type/shape ever seen) is the easiest thing to speculate on: a single tight guard, and — crucially — it can be **inlined**, which is the highest-leverage optimization because it exposes the callee's body to all the optimizations that work across the now-flattened call boundary. As a site sees more types, its inline cache goes **polymorphic** (a small guarded switch, still ok) then **megamorphic** (the engine gives up specializing — generic dispatch, no inlining, speculation largely abandoned). Protecting monomorphism protects inlining.

---

## Engine-Specific

## Question 11

**(HotSpot) What is an "uncommon trap" and when is it used?**

An uncommon trap is HotSpot's deopt mechanism: a point in C2-compiled code that, when reached, triggers deoptimization to the interpreter. It's used wherever the compiler speculated and needs an escape route — a failed type/class check (`class_check`), a null where non-null was assumed (`null_check`), an out-of-bounds index (`range_check`), or a branch the compiler pruned/biased and didn't fully compile (`unstable_if`). The trap reason names the broken bet. Branch pruning is the cleanest example: the cold branch isn't compiled at all, only an uncommon trap is placed at its entry, so you pay zero optimization cost for code you don't run.

---

## Question 12

**(HotSpot) How can loading a class deoptimize code that's already running, and what are "not entrant" and "zombie" states?**

Via **Class Hierarchy Analysis (CHA)**. At compile time, C2 may find that a method has no overriding subclass loaded, and speculatively **devirtualize and inline** it, recording a *dependency* on "no override exists." Later, dynamically loading a subclass that overrides it breaks the dependency. The class loader checks registered dependencies, finds the dependent compiled code, and invalidates it via **lazy deopt**: the code is marked **not entrant** (no new calls enter it; active frames deopt on return). Once no activations remain, it transitions to **zombie** and its code cache space is reclaimable. The next call recompiles, this time with a polymorphic guard or real virtual dispatch. This is why you can make hot virtuals `final` to turn a provisional CHA bet into a permanent fact.

---

## Question 13

**(HotSpot) How do you observe compilation and deoptimization, and what does `made not entrant` tell you?**

Use `-XX:+PrintCompilation` (each compile/invalidation event) with `-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+TraceDeoptimization`. In `PrintCompilation`, `%` marks an OSR (long loop compiled mid-run), `!` indicates exception handlers, and `made not entrant` / `made zombie` mark **invalidated** code — frequently from a CHA break after a class load. Correlating `made not entrant` bursts with `-Xlog:class+load` reveals invalidation waves: front-loading class loading during warm-up moves them off the live-traffic path. For low-overhead production observation, prefer JFR compilation/deopt events or async-profiler over fleet-wide verbose flags.

---

## Question 14

**(V8) What is a "bailout/deopt," and what do reasons like `wrong map`, `not a Smi`, and `hole` mean?**

A bailout (V8's word for deopt) abandons TurboFan/Maglev-optimized code and returns to a lower tier (baseline/Ignition), reconstructing the frame from translation data. The **reason** names the broken bet:

- **`wrong map`** — the object's hidden class (V8 calls it a *map*) changed; the optimized code's shape guard failed. Usually caused by building "the same" object with different keys/order, or adding fields after construction.
- **`not a Smi`** — a value expected to be a Small Integer wasn't (it became a double, or overflowed the SMI range). The integer bet broke.
- **`hole`** — a packed-array access hit a hole; the array became holey, breaking the packed-elements bet.

Reading the reason is the fastest route to root cause: it points directly at shape, numeric domain, or array representation.

---

## Question 15

**(V8) Explain hidden classes (maps), elements kinds, and how they drive deopts.**

V8 doesn't store JS objects as dictionaries by default; it gives each object a **hidden class / map** describing its fields and their offsets, so property access compiles to a fixed offset load guarded by a map check. Constructing objects differently (different keys, different order, fields added later) creates *different maps*; feeding multiple maps through one access site pushes it polymorphic → megamorphic and deopts shape-specialized code (`wrong map`).

**Elements kinds** are the analogous concept for arrays: `PACKED_SMI_ELEMENTS` (all small ints, fastest) → `PACKED_DOUBLE_ELEMENTS` (a float appeared) → `PACKED_ELEMENTS` (an object appeared) → `HOLEY_*` (a hole appeared). Transitions are **one-way** and they deopt code specialized for the old kind. So `arr.push(3.14)` into an int array, or `arr[100]=x` leaving holes, can deopt a billion-iteration loop. Typed arrays (`Int32Array`, `Float64Array`) have a fixed representation and sidestep these transitions entirely.

---

## Question 16

**(V8) How do you check whether a function is optimized, and how do you force a deopt for testing?**

Run Node/V8 with `--allow-natives-syntax` and use the intrinsics: `%OptimizeFunctionOnNextCall(fn)` to request optimization, `%GetOptimizationStatus(fn)` to read a bitmask of its state (optimized / interpreted / marked-for-deopt / turbofanned). Combined with `--trace-deopt` and `--trace-opt`, you can warm a function, optimize it, then feed an input that breaks its bet and watch the deopt fire with a named reason. This is also how you write **CI regression guards** — assert that a hot function stays optimized, or that a benchmark's deopt count stays under a budget, so a refactor that reintroduces a storm fails the build.

---

## Question 17

**(SpiderMonkey) How does Firefox's engine fit the same model?**

SpiderMonkey tiers Interpreter → Baseline → WarpMonkey/Ion (its optimizing compiler). It calls its deopts **bailouts**: when an Ion/Warp-compiled function hits a speculation it can't honor, it bails back to **Baseline**, reconstructing the Baseline frame from recorded snapshot/recovery metadata (its analogue of scope descriptors / translations). Same bet/guard/deopt core, same shape-and-type sensitivities (it has its own *Shapes* concept for objects), different tier names and the word "bailout." If you can explain V8, you can explain SpiderMonkey by analogy — the interviewer is checking whether you understand the *model* or just one vendor's vocabulary.

---

## Question 18

**(.NET) Does the CLR deoptimize the way V8 and HotSpot do? Explain the difference.**

Largely **no**, and this is the most important cross-engine distinction. The CLR uses **tiered compilation** (QuickJIT/Tier-0 → optimized Tier-1) and **Dynamic PGO**, and it *speculates* — but it does **not** frame-rewind-deopt a running method when a type bet breaks. Its **guarded devirtualization** compiles `if (type == ProfiledType) { inlined fast path } else { normal virtual call }` — the fallback is a **branch inside the same compiled method**, not an abandonment of the frame and reconstruction of interpreter state. So "deopt storms" as a pathology are essentially a V8/HotSpot/SpiderMonkey phenomenon; on .NET you reason about whether PGO captured the dominant type (so the guard usually hits), tier-up timing, and ReadyToRun/NativeAOT for startup. Naming this distinction signals you understand that *frame-rewinding deopt is one specific implementation of speculative fallback*, not a law of all JITs.

---

## Question 19

**(.NET) What knobs and tools matter for speculation/tiering on .NET, and why?**

Knobs: `DOTNET_TieredCompilation` (on/off), `DOTNET_TieredPGO` (Dynamic PGO for better Tier-1 specialization/guarded devirt), `DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops` (whether loops get Tier-0), ReadyToRun (AOT-compiled IL for fast startup), and NativeAOT (full ahead-of-time). Tools: `dotnet-trace`/EventPipe with the runtime JIT provider, `DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary`, `dotnet-counters` (time-in-JIT), and BenchmarkDotNet (which handles warm-up/tiering correctly). You use these to confirm hot methods reached Tier-1 and that guarded devirt picked the right dominant type — not to hunt frame-rewinding deopts.

---

## Question 20

**(Cross-engine) `arguments` in JS, and finalizable/reflective patterns on the JVM — why do these historically hurt optimization?**

In older V8, constructs like `arguments`, `eval`, `with`, and `try/catch` could disable or severely limit optimization because they made the function's behavior hard to analyze/specialize; modern V8 handles most of them far better, but `arguments` is still worth avoiding in hot code in favor of rest parameters (`...args`). On the JVM, dynamic class loading, reflection, proxies, and bytecode generation (common in ORMs/DI frameworks) inject extra types/shapes and break CHA assumptions, pushing call sites polymorphic/megamorphic and triggering invalidation waves. In both worlds the theme is the same: **constructs that increase behavioral diversity or defeat static reasoning erode the engine's ability to speculate.**

---

## Tricky-Trap

## Question 21

**A colleague says "I'm getting deopts, so I'll add `// @ts-ignore` / disable the JIT to fix the wrong answers." What's wrong with this?**

Multiple errors. First, **deopts never produce wrong answers** — they're slower-but-correct by construction, so there are no "wrong answers" caused by deopt to fix. If the output is wrong, it's a logic bug, full stop. Second, **disabling the JIT** (`--no-opt`, `-Xint`) doesn't "fix" deopts — it removes the fast path entirely, making everything uniformly slower. Disabling optimization is a legitimate *diagnostic* (does the regression involve the optimizer?) but never a production *fix*. The real fix is to stabilize the broken bet (shape, type, value domain, call target).

---

## Question 22

**This loop runs fast for a million iterations, then suddenly slows for the rest. What's likely happening?**

A single iteration broke a value-domain bet and deopted the loop into a more general (slower) form, and it never recovered to the fast specialization. Common causes: an integer computation **overflowed** the SMI/int32 range (`not a Smi`), the loop pushed a **float** into an integer array (elements-kind transition), an index went **out of bounds** breaking range-check elimination, a **null** hit a non-null speculation, or a **hole** appeared in a packed array. The fingerprint is "fast then permanently slower at a value boundary." Trace with `--trace-deopt`, read the reason, find the boundary-crossing value.

---

## Question 23

**You profile a function and it looks slow, but you optimized it carefully. The profiler shows lots of time in `*IC` builtins. What does that mean?**

The hot call/property-access site went **megamorphic**: too many shapes/types flowed through it, so V8 abandoned specialization and dispatches through generic inline-cache builtins (`LoadIC`/`CallIC`) instead of inlined optimized code. Time concentrated in `*IC` builtins (rather than inlined frames) is the signature. Your "optimized" code is correct but the site can no longer be inlined or specialized. Fix by reducing shape/type diversity at that site — unify object construction, or split the generic dispatch into per-kind monomorphic sites (e.g. a handler table keyed by `kind`).

---

## Question 24

**Why might an object you thought was "local and cheap" still get heap-allocated, defeating scalar replacement?**

Escape analysis is usually only effective *after inlining* exposes the object's full lifetime. If a method that would let the object escape isn't inlined — because it's too big, behind a megamorphic/virtual call, or otherwise un-inlinable — EA conservatively assumes the object **escapes** and keeps the allocation. So a syntactically-local object can still be heap-allocated because some callee in its path wasn't inlined. The lesson: scalar replacement is *downstream of* inlining; protect inlining (monomorphism, reasonable method size) and EA follows.

---

## Question 25

**Your microbenchmark says version A is 3× faster than version B, but in production they're identical. What might be wrong with the benchmark?**

Most likely you measured **warm-up**, not steady state — the benchmark didn't discard the interpreter/baseline iterations before the optimizing JIT kicked in, so you compared tiers, not algorithms. Other classic flaws: the benchmark's inputs were so uniform that the JIT speculated more aggressively than production (which sees diverse inputs and deopts), dead-code elimination removed the work entirely (your loop computed a value you never used), or you ran under a profiler/debugger that forced **deopt-all** and measured de-optimized code. Use a proper harness (JMH, BenchmarkDotNet, or a Node harness with explicit warm-up) and feed realistic input diversity.

---

## Question 26

**True or false: making everything in your hot path monomorphic and shape-stable is always good. Defend your answer.**

False as stated. It's good on *proven hot paths*, and pointless-to-harmful elsewhere. Aggressively shape-stabilizing, monomorphizing, and converting to typed arrays across an entire codebase makes it rigid, uglier, and harder to maintain for **zero gain on cold code** — most functions never get hot enough to be optimized. The senior approach is *measure first*: use a profiler to find genuinely hot code, use a trace to confirm it's actually deopting/megamorphic, and apply JIT-friendly patterns surgically there. Premature JIT-tuning is a real cost.

---

## Question 27

**After deploying a JVM service, throughput drops for several seconds, then recovers. No GC pauses correlate. What's a likely cause?**

A **CHA-invalidation wave** driven by class loading. Frameworks (DI, ORM, proxies, lazy initialization) load many classes during the first requests; each load can break a class-hierarchy assumption that C2 speculatively devirtualized/inlined, triggering lazy deopts (`made not entrant`) and forcing recompilation across many hot methods at once. Combined with the normal tier-up of a freshly started process, you get a throughput dip that recovers as the JIT re-settles. Correlate `-XX:+PrintCompilation` invalidation bursts with `-Xlog:class+load`. Mitigation: front-load class loading and warm the JIT during readiness, and gate the load balancer on warm-up completion so peak traffic doesn't hit the un-settled process.

---

## Design

## Question 28

**You're designing a hot request-dispatch layer that handles many message types. How do you structure it to stay JIT-friendly?**

Keep each dispatch *site* monomorphic so it stays inlinable, and keep each message *shape* uniform:

- **Dispatch by a discriminant first**, then call a per-kind handler so each handler's call site sees one concrete shape: a table/`switch` keyed by `msg.kind` mapping to `handleText`, `handleImage`, etc. — each site monomorphic, not one generic `node.handle()` that goes megamorphic.
- **Construct each message type through a single factory** so it has one hidden class everywhere (same keys, same order, no fields added post-construction).
- **Keep value domains stable** inside hot handlers (don't mix int/double; use typed arrays for numeric payloads).
- **Front-load any class loading / warm-up** so CHA invalidations happen before serving traffic; gate readiness on warm-up.
- **Add a regression guard** (opt-status / deopt-count assertion) so a future refactor that reintroduces polymorphism fails CI.

The principle: *one shape per site, one site per kind, stable domains, warm before serving.*

---

## Question 29

**Design a CI gate that catches deopt regressions before they reach production. What do you measure and what are the pitfalls?**

Measure a **bounded deopt budget** and/or **optimization status** on representative hot paths:

- Run a hot-path benchmark under `--trace-deopt` (V8) or with JFR/`PrintCompilation` (JVM), parse the output, count deopts on the function(s) of interest, and **fail the build if the count exceeds a budget** that allows normal warm-up but not a storm.
- Alternatively, in V8 with `--allow-natives-syntax`, warm the function and assert `%GetOptimizationStatus` shows it stayed optimized (not marked-for-deopt).
- Pin the runtime version in CI so results are reproducible.

Pitfalls: (1) deopt **reason strings are not a stable API** — parse loosely and re-validate on runtime upgrades; (2) set the budget to tolerate warm-up so you don't get flaky failures; (3) ensure the benchmark feeds **realistic input diversity** — a too-uniform benchmark passes while production deopts; (4) don't run under a profiler/debugger that forces deopt-all and skews counts. The gate turns an invisible, emergent slowdown into a red build.

---

## Question 30

**Your team is moving a latency-critical service to serverless (frequent cold starts). The current JVM/Node code relies heavily on JIT speculation for its speed. How do you reason about this, and what changes?**

The regime flips from **steady-state** (long-lived process, JIT pays off) to **cold-start-dominated** (each invocation may run mostly un-tiered code). Speculation's benefit assumes a process lives long enough to warm up; serverless often doesn't. Reasoning and changes:

- **Identify the regime explicitly:** measure how much of a typical invocation runs in the interpreter/baseline tier vs optimized. If most work happens before tier-up, JIT speculation isn't helping you.
- **Shift toward AOT:** GraalVM **native-image** (JVM) or **NativeAOT** / **ReadyToRun** (.NET) compile ahead of time, trading peak steady-state throughput for fast, predictable startup — usually the right trade for cold-start-bound work. Node has fewer AOT options, but snapshotting (V8 startup snapshots, `--snapshot-blob`) and keeping bundles small help.
- **Or keep processes warm:** provisioned concurrency / pre-warmed pools / min-instances so the JIT *has* warmed up before real traffic — keeps the JIT path but defeats some of serverless's elasticity/cost model.
- **Lower-tier policy:** for short-lived processes, configuring the runtime to spend less effort on aggressive optimization (which won't pay back) can reduce startup CPU.

The meta-point an interviewer wants: **speculation is a steady-state optimization; in a cold-start regime you often trade it away for AOT or keep processes warm.** Recognizing *which regime you're in before tuning* is the senior judgment.

---

## Question 31

**Design question: you maintain a widely-used library in a JIT'd ecosystem (npm or Maven). How does deopt/speculation influence your API design, since you don't control how consumers call you?**

Because consumers' hot paths run *through your code*, your API can put them on slow paths without their knowledge:

- **Return shape-stable objects.** Always return objects with the same keys in the same order; never conditionally add/omit fields. A single factory per type → one hidden class → consumers' access sites stay monomorphic.
- **Keep callbacks/hot methods monomorphic-friendly.** Avoid forcing consumers to pass heterogeneous objects through one of your hot internal sites; if you dispatch, dispatch by discriminant into per-kind paths.
- **Don't leak holey/heterogeneous arrays.** If you hand back arrays, keep them packed and homogeneous (or document/return typed arrays for numeric data).
- **Avoid megamorphism amplifiers** internally — minimize reflection/proxies on hot paths (JVM), avoid `arguments` and dynamic shape mutation (JS).
- **Make hot virtuals non-overridable** where it won't hurt extensibility (JVM `final`), so CHA devirtualization sticks for consumers.
- **Benchmark with diverse inputs and a regression gate**, since your library's hot paths are exercised in ways you didn't anticipate.

The principle: a library author's shape/type discipline is inherited by every consumer's JIT, so *predictability is part of your public contract* even though it isn't in the type signature.
