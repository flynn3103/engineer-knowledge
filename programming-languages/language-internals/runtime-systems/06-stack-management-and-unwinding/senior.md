# Stack Management & Unwinding — Senior Level

> **Topic:** Stack Management & Unwinding
> **Focus:** Reconstructing caller frames without a frame pointer — DWARF CFI / `.eh_frame`, Windows `.pdata`/`.xdata`, and the two-phase, zero-cost exception unwind with personality routines and landing pads.

---

## Introduction

> Focus: **If there's no frame pointer to chase, how does a debugger, profiler, or exception runtime find the caller — and how does throwing an exception run every destructor on the way out?**

The middle level ended on a cliffhanger: frame-pointer omission removes the linked chain that naive stack walking relies on, so finding a caller becomes a *lookup*. This level is that lookup. The compiler emits, alongside the code, a compact program describing — for every instruction in every function — *where the return address is, how to compute the previous stack pointer (the CFA), and how to restore each callee-saved register*. On Unix-family systems this is **DWARF Call Frame Information (CFI)**, stored in the `.eh_frame` section (for runtime unwinding) and/or `.debug_frame` (for debuggers). On Windows x64 it's **function tables** in `.pdata`/`.xdata`. An unwinder *interprets* this table to step from one frame to the next, with no frame pointer in sight.

The same machinery powers two things that look unrelated but aren't: (1) **stack walking** for backtraces, profilers, and GC root scanning; and (2) **exception unwinding** — the act of "throwing" an exception, which must walk *up* the stack, find a handler, and run every destructor / cleanup along the way. Modern C++ and similar languages use **table-based, "zero-cost" exceptions**: the normal (non-throwing) path costs *nothing* — no flag-setting, no `setjmp` — because all the unwinding knowledge lives in side tables consulted *only when an exception is actually thrown*. This replaced the old `setjmp`/`longjmp` scheme, where every protected scope paid a runtime cost on the happy path.

In one sentence: **unwind tables are a compiler-emitted program that an unwinder runs to reconstruct any frame's caller and restore registers — and exceptions are just that unwinder, driven by a two-phase search-then-cleanup protocol with a per-language personality routine deciding what to do at each frame.**

> 🎓 **Why this matters for a senior:** This is the layer where "my profiler shows `[unknown]`," "my C++ exception leaks because a destructor didn't run," "my crash dump can't unwind past the JIT'd frame," and "my signal-safe stack walker deadlocks" all live. You can't reason about these without understanding CFI and the two-phase unwind. It's also the conceptual bridge to GC (stack maps for root scanning) and to async runtimes (which *lose* the natural stack and must rebuild a logical one).

This page covers: DWARF CFI semantics (CFA, register rules, CFI directives), `.eh_frame` vs `.debug_frame`, Windows `.pdata`/`.xdata`, the `_Unwind_*` API and the two-phase unwind, personality routines and landing pads, the LSDA, `setjmp`/`longjmp` vs zero-cost exceptions, async-signal-safe stack walking, and tail-call effects on unwinding. `professional.md` then covers growable stacks, guard pages, GC stack maps, and profiling at fleet scale.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The middle file — calling conventions, frame layout, caller/callee-saved registers, and especially *why frame-pointer omission breaks naive walking*.
- **Required:** Comfort with the idea of a return address and the CFA (canonical frame address).
- **Required:** Familiarity with C++ (or another language with destructors/RAII) and exceptions.
- **Helpful:** Having looked at ELF sections (`readelf -S`) and DWARF (`readelf --debug-dump=frames`, `objdump --dwarf=frames`).
- **Helpful:** Awareness of signals and async-signal-safety.

You do **not** yet need:

- Go's copying/growable stacks and stack maps in detail (that's `professional.md`).
- Guard pages and stack-overflow-via-`SIGSEGV` mechanics (touched here, detailed in `professional.md`).

## Core Concepts

### 1. CFI: A Table That Says "How Do I Undo This Frame"

For each function, the compiler emits an unwind *program* keyed by instruction address. At any program counter, the unwinder can ask the table three questions:

1. **What is the CFA here?** Usually expressed as "`rsp + N`" or "`rbp + 16`". The CFA is the anchor; once you have it, everything else is an offset from it.
2. **Where is the return address?** Typically "CFA − 8" on SysV. Reading it gives the caller's PC.
3. **Where are the callee-saved registers I clobbered?** E.g. "`rbx` is saved at CFA − 24." The unwinder restores them so the caller's state is correct.

Crucially, the answers *change across the function body*. Right at function entry, before `sub rsp, 32`, the CFA is `rsp + 8`; after the subtraction it's `rsp + 40`. CFI is therefore a piecewise description: "from offset 0 to 4, CFA = rsp+8; from offset 4 onward, CFA = rsp+40," and so on. The compiler tracks this with **CFI directives** (`.cfi_def_cfa_offset`, `.cfi_offset rbx, -24`, …) that the assembler turns into the FDE bytecode.

Stepping one frame = "read CFA → read return address at CFA−8 → restore saved registers → set `rsp` = CFA → set PC = return address." Repeat until you reach the top. **No frame pointer required.**

### 2. `.eh_frame` Structure: CIE and FDE

`.eh_frame` is a list of two record types:

- **CIE (Common Information Entry):** shared settings for a group of functions — the code/data alignment factors, the return-address register, the pointer encoding, and a pointer to the personality routine and LSDA for exception-bearing functions.
- **FDE (Frame Description Entry):** one per function, pointing at its CIE and carrying the per-instruction CFI program (a sequence of `DW_CFA_*` opcodes) for that function's address range.

`.eh_frame` is kept even in stripped, optimized release binaries, because the C++ runtime *needs* it to throw exceptions. `.debug_frame` is the same information for debuggers and can be stripped. This is why exceptions still work in a `strip`ped binary but `gdb` backtraces may degrade.

### 3. Windows x64: `.pdata` / `.xdata`

Windows takes a more *structured*, less general approach. Every non-leaf function has a `RUNTIME_FUNCTION` entry in `.pdata` giving its start/end addresses and a pointer to `UNWIND_INFO` in `.xdata`. The `UNWIND_INFO` is a compact list of **unwind codes** that describe exactly what the prologue did (`UWOP_PUSH_NONVOL`, `UWOP_ALLOC_SMALL`, `UWOP_SET_FPREG`, …). To unwind, the OS runtime (`RtlVirtualUnwind`) *replays the prologue in reverse* using these codes. Because the prologue is required to follow strict rules (all stack allocation and register saves up front, no interleaving), this is simpler and faster to interpret than general DWARF — but less flexible. Exceptions on Windows (SEH and C++ on top of it) drive this same table.

### 4. Two-Phase Unwinding: Search, Then Cleanup

When C++ `throw`s, control enters `__cxa_throw` → `_Unwind_RaiseException`, and the **two-phase** protocol begins:

- **Phase 1 — Search.** The unwinder walks up the stack (using CFI) *without modifying it*, calling each frame's **personality routine** to ask "does this frame have a handler for this exception type?" It keeps walking until a personality routine says "yes, I'll catch it" (or it runs off the top → `std::terminate`). Critically, *nothing is destroyed yet*. This matters: if no handler exists, the standard lets the implementation call `terminate` *with the stack intact*, so a debugger sees the original throw site — not a half-unwound stack.

- **Phase 2 — Cleanup.** Now the unwinder walks up *again*, this time actually unwinding each frame. At each frame the personality routine identifies the **landing pad** to run — code that destroys the frame's locals (RAII destructors) and, at the handler frame, transfers into the `catch` block. The unwinder restores registers and `rsp` per CFI as it goes.

The two passes exist precisely so that "is there a handler at all?" is decided *before* any destructor runs.

### 5. Personality Routine, Landing Pads, and the LSDA

The **personality routine** (for C++ on Itanium ABI: `__gxx_personality_v0`) is the language-specific brain of unwinding. At each frame the generic unwinder hands it the exception and the current PC; the personality routine consults that function's **LSDA** (Language-Specific Data Area) to decide:

- Is the current PC inside a `try` region that catches this type? (→ phase 1 says "handler found.")
- What **landing pad** should run here for cleanup? (→ phase 2 runs destructors / enters `catch`.)
- Which `catch` clause matches, by RTTI type comparison?

The LSDA is a call-site table: ranges of PCs → landing pad addresses → action records (which catch types apply). The compiler generates all of it from your `try`/`catch` and from the implicit destructors of locals. This is why exceptions are "zero-cost" on the happy path: the *only* thing in the hot path is the normal code; the entire decision apparatus sits in `.eh_frame` + LSDA, consulted only on `throw`.

### 6. Zero-Cost vs `setjmp`/`longjmp`

The older exception model used **`setjmp`/`longjmp`**: entering a protected scope ran `setjmp` (saving registers into a jmp_buf) and registered a cleanup handler on a runtime-maintained linked list; `throw` did a `longjmp` back. The cost was paid *on every protected scope, every time, even when nothing throws* — runtime work on the happy path, plus a chain of registrations.

**Table-based zero-cost** exceptions move *all* of that into static tables. The non-throwing path executes exactly the instructions it would without exceptions. You pay only when you actually throw (and then you pay a lot — unwinding is slow). This is the right trade for the common case (throws are rare), and it's why "exceptions are free until you use them" is literally true for the normal path — though the *binary* pays in size (the tables) and *throwing* pays in latency.

### 7. The Same Machinery Walks Stacks for Profilers and GC

Backtraces, sampling profilers, and garbage-collector root scanning all need to enumerate live frames — the same problem exceptions solve. A profiler interrupting a thread can unwind via CFI to attribute a sample to a call chain (or use frame pointers, or hardware LBR, if available — see the trade-offs below). A precise GC needs to find every pointer in every live frame to scan roots; it uses **stack maps** (per-safepoint metadata saying "at this PC, slots X, Y hold pointers"), conceptually a cousin of CFI but for *pointer liveness* rather than register restoration. (Stack maps and GC roots are detailed in `professional.md` and in the garbage-collection topic.)

### 8. Async-Signal-Safe Walking Is Hard

A profiler typically samples by delivering a signal and unwinding inside the handler. But full DWARF interpretation can `malloc`, take locks, or touch non-reentrant state — none of which is async-signal-safe. So in-handler unwinders must use restricted, allocation-free fast paths (frame-pointer walking, or precomputed/`mmap`'d unwind info, or hardware mechanisms). This is a core reason `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` is back in favor: frame-pointer walking is trivially signal-safe and fast, whereas DWARF unwinding in a signal handler is fragile.

---

## Real-World Analogies

- **CFI is a reverse-assembly instruction manual.** For every step of building the furniture (the prologue), there's a numbered step for taking it apart. The unwinder reads the manual backward to disassemble any frame, even one with no handle (frame pointer) to grab.

- **Two-phase unwind is "evacuate, but check the exits first."** Phase 1 is the fire warden walking the building to confirm there *is* an unlocked exit before anyone moves. Phase 2 is the actual evacuation, switching off equipment (destructors) room by room on the way out. You don't start destroying things until you know there's somewhere to escape to.

- **The personality routine is a per-tenant building manager.** The generic fire system (unwinder) doesn't know each tenant's rules, so at every floor it asks that floor's manager (the language's personality routine), "Do you handle this? What do I shut down here?"

- **Zero-cost exceptions are insurance, not a toll booth.** The old `setjmp` model charged a toll at *every* door you walked through. The table-based model is insurance: you pay nothing per door; you only "claim" (pay the unwinding cost) when disaster actually strikes.

---

## Mental Models

- **"CFI turns 'find the caller' from a pointer-chase into running a tiny program."** The table *is* a program; the unwinder is its interpreter.

- **"Everything is relative to the CFA."** Return address, saved registers, the previous `rsp` — all expressed as offsets from one canonical anchor per frame.

- **"Phase 1 asks, phase 2 acts."** Search establishes that a handler exists *with the stack untouched*; only then does cleanup destroy frames.

- **"Zero-cost means zero on the *normal* path — throwing is expensive."** The cost didn't vanish; it moved off the hot path and onto the (rare) throw path, plus binary size.

- **"`.eh_frame` survives stripping; `.debug_frame` doesn't."** Exceptions are a *runtime* feature, so their tables ship in release builds.

- **"Signal-context unwinding wants frame pointers."** Full DWARF in a handler is not reliably async-signal-safe; FP walking is.

---

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Look at the unwind tables in a real binary

```bash
cat > ex.cpp <<'EOF'
#include <cstdio>
struct Guard { ~Guard() { printf("cleanup\n"); } };
void inner() { Guard g; throw 42; }     // destructor must run during unwind
int main() {
    try { inner(); }
    catch (int e) { printf("caught %d\n", e); }
}
EOF
g++ -O2 ex.cpp -o ex
./ex                              # prints: cleanup / caught 42

readelf -S ex | grep -E 'eh_frame|gcc_except'   # the unwind + LSDA sections
objdump --dwarf=frames ex | head -40            # decoded CIE/FDE / CFI program
```

`objdump --dwarf=frames` shows the CIE (shared settings, return-address register, personality pointer) and one FDE per function with `DW_CFA_*` opcodes like `DW_CFA_def_cfa_offset` and `DW_CFA_offset`.

### Example 2: See the CFI directives the compiler emits

```bash
g++ -O2 -S ex.cpp -o ex.s
grep -n 'cfi_' ex.s | head -20
```

You'll see lines like:

```asm
inner:
    .cfi_startproc
    push  %rbx
    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16     ; pushing rbx moved the CFA
    .cfi_offset 3, -16         ; rbx (DWARF reg 3) saved at CFA-16
    ; ... body, the throw ...
    .cfi_endproc
```

These directives are the *source* of the FDE bytecode. They tell the unwinder how to recompute the CFA and where `rbx` was saved at each point.

### Example 3: A leak that proves destructors run during unwind

```cpp
// If exception unwinding did NOT run destructors, this would leak.
// RAII works precisely because phase-2 cleanup invokes ~unique_ptr.
#include <memory>
#include <stdexcept>

void may_throw(bool boom) {
    auto p = std::make_unique<int[]>(1'000'000);   // owns heap memory
    if (boom) throw std::runtime_error("boom");    // unwind runs ~unique_ptr
    // ... normal use of p ...
}                                                  // ~unique_ptr also runs here
```

The single most important practical consequence of this whole topic: **C++ RAII safety is exception unwinding doing its job.** A landing pad runs `~unique_ptr`, which frees the array, as the frame is destroyed during phase 2.

### Example 4: `noexcept` changes the failure mode

```cpp
#include <stdexcept>
void leaf() { throw std::runtime_error("x"); }

void promised_safe() noexcept {
    leaf();   // if this throws, std::terminate is called immediately.
}
// `noexcept` lets the compiler emit NO unwind path through this frame.
// A throw that escapes it -> terminate(), often without unwinding above.
```

`noexcept` is a contract that lets the compiler omit unwind machinery for that frame, enabling optimizations — but a violated `noexcept` is fatal: `std::terminate`, typically with the stack *not* unwound past the violation.

### Example 5: Why a profiler shows `[unknown]` (the FPO + no-DWARF case)

```bash
# Build with FPO (default at -O2) and strip eh_frame access for the profiler:
g++ -O2 hot.cpp -o hot          # -fomit-frame-pointer is implied at -O2
perf record -g ./hot            # default 'fp' call-graph mode
perf report                     # many frames collapse to [unknown]

# Fixes:
g++ -O2 -fno-omit-frame-pointer hot.cpp -o hot   # FP walking works
# or tell perf to use DWARF (heavier; copies stack at each sample):
perf record --call-graph dwarf ./hot
# or use hardware last-branch records:
perf record --call-graph lbr ./hot
```

This is the canonical "make flame graphs work" decision tree: frame pointers (cheap, needs rebuild), DWARF (works on FPO builds, expensive per-sample), or LBR (hardware, limited depth).

---

## Pros & Cons

**Table-based zero-cost exceptions:**

| Pro | Con |
|-----|-----|
| No runtime cost on the non-throwing path. | Throwing is *slow* (table interpretation, two passes). |
| Enables RAII cleanup correctly and language-agnostically. | Larger binaries (`.eh_frame` + LSDA can be a meaningful fraction of code size). |
| Works for cross-language unwinding via the common ABI. | Unwinding in restricted contexts (signals) is not async-signal-safe. |

**DWARF CFI stack walking vs frame-pointer walking vs LBR:**

| Method | Pro | Con |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Frame pointers** | Trivial, fast, signal-safe. | Costs a register + a couple instructions per call. |
| **DWARF CFI** | Works on FPO builds; precise. | Per-sample interpretation is expensive; needs the stack copied; fragile in signal handlers. |
| **Hardware LBR** | Near-zero overhead; works regardless of FP/FPO. | Limited branch-record depth; CPU-specific; truncates deep stacks. |

---

## Use Cases

- **C++/Rust/Swift exceptions and panics** — the runtime unwinds via CFI, running cleanup. (Rust panics with `panic=unwind` use the same Itanium machinery; `panic=abort` skips it.)
- **Debuggers** — `gdb`/`lldb` reconstruct backtraces on FPO/optimized code by interpreting `.eh_frame`/`.debug_frame`.
- **Sampling profilers** — `perf`, async-profiler, etc., walk stacks via FP, DWARF, or LBR to build flame graphs.
- **Crash reporters / core-dump analysis** — post-mortem unwinding of a stripped release binary relies on `.eh_frame`.
- **Garbage collectors** — precise root scanning of live frames via stack maps (a CFI cousin).
- **Cross-language unwinding** — a single exception propagating through C++ → C → C++ frames, coordinated by the common `_Unwind_*` ABI.

---

## Coding Patterns

**Pattern: Make stacks walkable for production profiling.** For server fleets, compile with `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` (or ensure good DWARF + a DWARF-capable profiler, or rely on LBR). Decide deliberately; don't discover at incident time that your flame graphs are `[unknown]`.

**Pattern: Keep `.eh_frame` even when stripping.** Strip debug info (`.debug_*`) for size, but never strip `.eh_frame` from a binary that throws — you'll break exceptions and crash-reporter backtraces. `strip` preserves `.eh_frame` by default; custom linker scripts can wrongly drop it.

**Pattern: Annotate hand-written assembly with CFI directives.**

```asm
my_asm:
    .cfi_startproc
    push %rbp
    .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
    .cfi_offset %rbp, -16
    mov  %rsp, %rbp
    .cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp
    ; ... body ...
    pop  %rbp
    .cfi_def_cfa %rsp, 8
    ret
    .cfi_endproc
```

Without these directives, your assembly is a black hole for unwinding: backtraces stop dead at it, and an exception propagating *through* it will fail to find the caller and call `terminate`.

**Pattern: Use `noexcept` to mark truly-non-throwing leaf code**, enabling the compiler to omit unwind paths — but only when you can *guarantee* it, since a violation is `terminate`.

**Pattern: Prefer FP-based or LBR-based sampling for low-overhead, signal-safe profiling**; reserve DWARF call graphs for one-off deep dives where FPO binaries leave you no choice.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Decide your stack-walkability strategy before you need it.** Frame pointers, DWARF, or LBR — pick one and verify flame graphs are populated in staging.
2. **Never strip `.eh_frame` from exception-bearing or crash-reported binaries.** It's a runtime requirement, not debug info.
3. **CFI-annotate every hand-written assembly routine** (`.cfi_*`). Unannotated asm breaks unwinding and exception propagation through it.
4. **Treat `noexcept` as a real contract.** Only mark code `noexcept` you can prove won't throw; a violation aborts the process.
5. **Don't do full DWARF unwinding inside a signal handler.** Use a signal-safe fast path (FP walking) or a deferred/snapshot approach.
6. **Remember that throwing is expensive.** Don't use exceptions for ordinary control flow on hot paths — the unwind cost (two passes, table interpretation) is large compared to a return code.
7. **Verify cross-language unwinding paths.** If exceptions can cross an FFI boundary, ensure every frame in between has correct unwind info, or contain throws to one side.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Throwing through a C frame with no unwind info.** If an exception must propagate through C code compiled without `-fexceptions`, the unwinder may not find a path and calls `terminate`. Compile interposed C with unwind tables if exceptions cross it.
- **`noexcept` violation = `terminate`.** A function marked `noexcept` that lets an exception escape calls `std::terminate` immediately — often *without* unwinding the frames above, so destructors above don't run.
- **Destructors that throw during unwinding.** If a destructor throws *while* the stack is already unwinding for another exception, you have two active exceptions → `std::terminate`. Never let destructors throw.
- **JIT'd / dynamically generated code without registered unwind info.** A JIT must register `.eh_frame` (e.g. via `__register_frame`) or Windows function tables, or the unwinder stops at the JIT frame — breaking both exceptions and profiler backtraces.
- **DWARF unwinding in a signal handler.** Not async-signal-safe in general; can deadlock on a lock the interrupted thread already holds, or call `malloc`.
- **Tail-call elimination removes a frame.** A tail call replaces the current frame; the eliminated caller simply isn't on the stack, so backtraces legitimately omit it. This is correct behavior, not a bug — but it surprises people debugging "where did my caller go?"
- **Mismatched `.eh_frame` after binary patching / hot-patching.** If you rewrite code without updating CFI, the unwinder's offsets no longer match the prologue, producing wrong CFAs.
- **`-funwind-tables` vs `-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`.** The async variant emits CFI valid at *every* instruction (needed for signal-interrupted unwinding and profiling), not just at call sites. Profilable builds need the async tables.

## Cheat Sheet

```text
UNWIND TABLES
  Unix:    DWARF CFI in .eh_frame (runtime, kept when stripped)
                     and .debug_frame (debuggers, strippable)
           records: CIE (shared) + FDE (per function), DW_CFA_* opcodes
  Windows: .pdata (RUNTIME_FUNCTION) -> .xdata (UNWIND_INFO, unwind codes)
           RtlVirtualUnwind replays the prologue in reverse

STEP ONE FRAME (via CFI)
  CFA          = e.g. rsp + N   (canonical anchor)
  return addr  = *(CFA - 8)     (SysV)
  restore callee-saved regs from their CFA offsets
  rsp = CFA ; PC = return addr ; repeat

TWO-PHASE EXCEPTION UNWIND (Itanium ABI, _Unwind_*)
  Phase 1 SEARCH : walk up, ask each personality routine "handler?"
                   stack UNTOUCHED; none found -> terminate
  Phase 2 CLEANUP: walk up again, run landing pads (destructors),
                   enter catch at the handler frame
  personality routine + LSDA decide per frame what runs / catches

ZERO-COST vs SETJMP/LONGJMP
  zero-cost: nothing on the normal path; all cost in tables, paid on throw
  setjmp/longjmp (old): runtime cost on EVERY protected scope

STACK WALKING FOR PROFILERS
  frame pointers  -> cheap, signal-safe   (-fno-omit-frame-pointer)
  DWARF call-graph-> works on FPO, expensive, fragile in signals
  LBR             -> hardware, low overhead, shallow depth

GOTCHAS
  - never strip .eh_frame from throwing/crash-reported binaries
  - CFI-annotate hand-written asm (.cfi_*) or unwinding breaks there
  - throwing destructor during unwind -> terminate
  - noexcept violation -> terminate (no unwind above)
  - JIT code must register unwind info
  - profilable builds need -fasynchronous-unwind-tables
```

---

## Summary

When there's no frame pointer to chase, the unwinder runs a compiler-emitted program to reconstruct each caller. On Unix that program is **DWARF CFI** in `.eh_frame` (CIE + FDE records, `DW_CFA_*` opcodes) describing, per instruction, the **CFA** and how to restore the return address and callee-saved registers; on Windows it's `.pdata`/`.xdata` unwind codes that replay the prologue in reverse. Stepping a frame is "compute CFA → read return address → restore registers → set `rsp` and PC." The same tables serve debuggers, profilers, and crash reporters.

**Exception unwinding** is this walker driven by a protocol: a **two-phase** scheme that first *searches* up the stack (asking each frame's **personality routine**, via the **LSDA**, whether it handles the exception) without touching anything, then *cleans up* — running **landing pads** that fire destructors and enter the matching `catch`. This **table-based "zero-cost"** design puts no overhead on the non-throwing path (replacing the old `setjmp`/`longjmp` model that charged every protected scope), at the price of large unwind cost on a throw and bigger binaries. The practical edges — `[unknown]` flame graphs from FPO builds, throwing destructors hitting `terminate`, JIT frames breaking unwinding, signal-safe walking favoring frame pointers — all follow directly from this machinery. `professional.md` extends it to *growable* stacks (Go), guard-page overflow detection, GC stack maps, and async logical stacks.
