## Introduction

A managed heap is a negotiated illusion. The runtime promises your code that a reference stays valid for the object's lifetime, but it does *not* promise that the object stays at a fixed machine address. Compacting, copying, and generational collectors routinely **relocate live objects** — to defragment the heap, to keep allocation a cheap bump of a pointer, and to promote survivors between generations. After a move, the collector rewrites every managed reference it can find: roots on the stack, in registers, in static fields, and inside other heap objects. The illusion holds because the collector owns the full set of pointers.

It owns the *managed* set. The moment you hand a raw address to code the collector cannot see — a C library, a device doing DMA, the kernel reading a buffer mid-`read(2)` — that address becomes a liability. If a collection fires during the syscall and the buffer moves, the unmanaged side writes into freed or repurposed memory. **Pinning** is the contract that closes this gap: it tells the collector "this object must not move," so a stable address can safely cross the managed/unmanaged boundary.

This tier is about the *design space*. Every relocating runtime needs a pinning mechanism, and the shape of that mechanism reveals how the runtime weighs throughput, fragmentation, and interop ergonomics. Understanding .NET, the JVM, and Go side by side turns pinning from a per-API incantation into a coherent model you can reason about.

## Core Concepts

### Why a heap moves objects

Three forces push runtimes toward movable heaps:

- **Bump-pointer allocation.** If the live set is packed contiguously, allocation is `top += size; return old_top`. No free-list search, no size-class lookup, near-zero per-object cost. This only stays true if the collector periodically compacts away the holes left by dead objects.
- **Fragmentation control.** A non-moving allocator (think `malloc`) accumulates external fragmentation: free space exists but is chopped into pieces too small to satisfy a request. A compacting collector slides survivors together and reclaims one large contiguous region, so a 1 MB allocation never fails while 4 MB sits free-but-scattered.
- **Generational locality and promotion.** Copying collectors (Cheney-style semispace, or the young generation of most production GCs) evacuate survivors into a fresh region, which both compacts and physically separates young from old. Promotion *is* a move.

The common thread: the collector earns the right to move objects in exchange for cheap allocation and bounded fragmentation. Pinning is the localized, temporary surrender of that right.

### What "address stability" actually means

Be precise about three distinct notions, because conflating them causes bugs:

1. **Reference validity.** A managed reference (`object`, a Go pointer, a JVM `jobject`) stays valid across moves. The runtime fixes it up. You never observe the move through a managed reference.
2. **Address stability.** The *numeric machine address* stays constant. A movable heap explicitly does **not** guarantee this. Casting a reference to an integer (`GCHandle.AddrOfPinnedObject`, taking `&array[0]`, `uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(p))`) snapshots an address that may already be stale.
3. **Identity.** Object identity (reference equality) is preserved across moves and is independent of address. `RuntimeHelpers.GetHashCode`, Java's identity hash, and Go pointer comparison all remain correct because the runtime never compares raw addresses for identity — it stores a stable identity hash separately or rehomes the comparison through managed references.

Pinning is exactly the operation that *temporarily* promotes "reference validity" to "address stability."

### Pinning as the contract with the collector

Mechanically, pinning adds the object to a set the collector consults before relocating anything: "objects in the pinned set keep their current address." Different runtimes implement the set differently — a hash table of handles, a per-region flag, a side list scanned at the start of compaction — but the semantics are identical: **a pinned object is treated as immovable for the duration of the pin.**

The cost is that a pinned object becomes an obstacle. A compacting pass that wants to slide survivors leftward must stop at each pinned object, leaving a hole. Many pins, or long-lived pins, defeat the compaction the heap was designed around. This single fact drives every best practice in this topic.

## The Cross-Runtime Design Space

### .NET: fixed, GCHandle, and the Pinned Object Heap

.NET exposes pinning at three altitudes:

- **`fixed` statement** — lexically scoped, stack-cheap pinning. Inside the block the GC will not move the object; the pin is released at the closing brace. The pin lives in compiler-generated metadata (a "pinned local"), so it costs essentially nothing and cannot leak past the scope.

  ```csharp
  static unsafe void Hash(byte[] data) {
      fixed (byte* p = data) {           // array pinned for this block
          NativeLib.Sha256(p, data.Length);
      }                                  // unpinned here, deterministically
  }
  ```

- **`GCHandle.Alloc(obj, GCHandleType.Pinned)`** — an *unscoped* pin. The handle keeps the object pinned (and alive) until you call `Free()`. This is the right tool when the native side outlives a single call — e.g. you register a buffer with an OS object and the kernel writes into it asynchronously. It is also the classic leak: forget `Free()` and you have permanently immovable garbage.

  ```csharp
  var h = GCHandle.Alloc(buffer, GCHandleType.Pinned);
  IntPtr addr = h.AddrOfPinnedObject();
  Overlapped.RegisterForAsyncIo(addr, ...);
  // ... later, in the completion path:
  h.Free();                              // MUST run, or the pin is forever
  ```

- **`Memory<T>.Pin()` → `MemoryHandle`** — the modern, abstraction-friendly path. `Memory<T>` may be backed by a managed array, native memory, or a custom `MemoryManager<T>`; `Pin()` returns a `MemoryHandle` whose `Pointer` is stable until `Dispose()`. For an array-backed `Memory<T>` it pins the array; for native-backed memory it is a no-op pin (already immovable). This lets a library accept "some memory" and get a stable pointer without knowing the backing store.

**The Pinned Object Heap (POH), .NET 5+.** Pre-POH, pinned objects lived in the normal generations, so each pin punched a hole in gen0/gen2 compaction. POH is a separate, *non-compacting* heap segment dedicated to pinned objects. `GC.AllocateArray<T>(length, pinned: true)` allocates straight into it. The insight: if an object is going to be pinned for its whole life (a long-lived I/O buffer), segregating it means it never obstructs the compaction of the regular heap, and the collector never has to special-case it during compaction. POH trades a small amount of internal fragmentation in a dedicated region for the removal of pinning's drag on the main heap — a textbook "segregate the irregular case" design.

### JVM: JNI critical regions vs. copying

The JVM's HotSpot collectors are heavily copying/compacting, but the JVM has no general user-facing "pin this object" API. Instead, JNI offers two interop strategies and lets the VM choose whether to pin or copy:

- **`GetPrimitiveArrayCritical` / `ReleasePrimitiveArrayCritical`** — requests a direct pointer into a primitive array. The VM *may* pin (hand back the real address) or *may* copy. The contract is brutally restrictive: between `Get…Critical` and `Release…Critical` you are in a **critical region** where you must not make other JNI calls, must not block, and must not do anything that could trigger a GC or run arbitrary Java code. In practice, while a thread sits in a critical region, the VM often disables GC globally — so a slow critical region stalls *every* thread. This is the JVM admitting that pinning is so disruptive it only allows it under a no-blocking, no-allocation straitjacket.

- **`GetIntArrayElements` / `Get<Type>ArrayElements`** — returns a pointer and an `isCopy` out-parameter. The VM is free to either pin or copy; on a copying collector it almost always **copies**. `ReleaseIntArrayElements` takes a mode (`0` = copy back and free, `JNI_COMMIT` = copy back keep, `JNI_ABORT` = discard) so you control write-back. Because it may copy, it has no critical-region restrictions — but you pay a copy in each direction.

- **`DirectByteBuffer`** — the copy-free *and* pin-free alternative. A direct buffer is backed by **off-heap native memory** (allocated outside the Java heap), so the GC never moves it and native code can hold its address indefinitely via `GetDirectBufferAddress`. This is the JVM's strategic answer: rather than pin on-heap objects, push interop buffers off-heap entirely. NIO, Netty, and most high-performance I/O paths live here.

The JVM design philosophy is clear: avoid pinning the managed heap; copy for short hops, go off-heap for long-lived sharing.

### Go: cgo pointer rules and runtime.Pinner

Go's heap is moving in one specific, important way: **goroutine stacks grow and shrink by relocation**, and the runtime is increasingly free to move heap objects too. cgo therefore imposes the **pointer-passing rules**:

- Go memory passed to C **must not itself contain Go pointers**, unless those pointers are pinned. (A `*C.char` into a Go byte slice is fine; a Go struct containing `*OtherGoStruct` is not, because C might dereference a pointer the runtime later moves.)
- **C must not retain a copy of a Go pointer after the call returns.** Once the cgo call returns, the runtime is free to move or collect that memory. C may use the pointer *during* the call only.

`runtime.Pinner` (Go 1.21) makes the legal window explicit and extendable:

```go
var pinner runtime.Pinner
defer pinner.Unpin()                 // releases all pins at once

buf := make([]byte, 4096)
pinner.Pin(&buf[0])                  // address of buf[0] now stable
C.read_into(unsafe.Pointer(&buf[0]), C.size_t(len(buf)))
// safe: buf is pinned for the lifetime of `pinner`
```

`Pin` accepts a pointer to an object (or array element) and guarantees it will not move until `Unpin`. The crucial capability is **pinning Go pointers that are stored inside other Go memory passed to C** — pin the inner pointer, and a struct-with-pointers becomes legal to hand across the boundary. `Unpin` releases *every* pin on that `Pinner` at once, which is the idiomatic deferred-cleanup shape.

### Moving stacks: the interior-pointer hazard

Go (and other runtimes with movable stacks) makes a subtle point vivid: **the stack moves too.** When a goroutine's stack grows, the runtime allocates a larger stack and copies frames over, fixing up pointers into the stack. An *interior stack pointer* — `&localVar` handed to C — would dangle after such a copy if it weren't accounted for. This is why "take the address of a stack variable and stash it in C" is doubly dangerous: not only might the heap move, the stack itself is a moving target. The safe patterns are: copy to a heap allocation and pin it, or use C-allocated memory for anything the native side keeps.

## Sidebar: Rust `Pin<P>` Is a Different Thing

If you arrive here from Rust, disarm one major confusion immediately. **Rust's `Pin<P>` has nothing to do with garbage collection or heap relocation.** Rust has no moving GC; it has no GC at all. `Pin<P>` is a *type-system* construct: it statically guarantees that the pointee will **never be moved in memory again** for the rest of its life, by preventing safe code from obtaining a `&mut T` it could use to move the value (unless `T: Unpin`).

Its purpose is **self-referential types**, the canonical case being `async` state machines (futures). A future generated by `async fn` may hold a pointer into its own body — e.g. a borrow that spans an `.await`. If that future were moved after the borrow was created, the internal pointer would dangle. `Pin` makes the move statically impossible, so self-references stay valid.

So the two "pins" answer opposite questions:

| | GC pinning (.NET / JVM / Go) | Rust `Pin<P>` |
|---|---|---|
| Problem it solves | A relocating collector might move an object out from under a raw pointer | A value with internal self-references must not be moved |
| Mechanism | Runtime/collector marks the object immovable at GC time | Compile-time type guarantee; no runtime collector involved |
| Duration | Temporary (until unpin/handle free) | Typically for the value's whole life |
| Enforced by | The garbage collector | The borrow checker / type system |

They share only the English word "pin." Treat them as unrelated when reasoning about either.

## Pros & Cons

**Movable heaps (the thing pinning fights):**

- **Pro:** O(1) bump allocation, bounded fragmentation, good locality after compaction, cheap promotion.
- **Con:** No address stability — every raw-pointer interop scenario needs an escape hatch.

**Pinning:**

- **Pro:** Hands stable addresses to native code, DMA, and the kernel with zero copying. Essential for high-throughput I/O where copying would dominate cost.
- **Con:** A pinned object obstructs compaction, creating holes (fragmentation). Many or long-lived pins degrade collection: less reclaimable contiguous space, more work per GC, and on the JVM critical-region pins can stall the whole VM. Pinning also keeps the object **alive** (it's a strong root), so leaked pins are memory leaks plus relocation leaks.

The trade is fundamentally local-and-temporary vs. global-and-persistent: pinning is cheap and correct when scoped tightly, and corrosive when it becomes ambient.

---

## Best Practices

- **Pin for the shortest possible window.** Prefer lexically scoped pins (`fixed`, a `Pinner` with `defer Unpin`) over open-ended handles. The ideal pin lasts exactly one synchronous native call.
- **For long-lived sharing, copy out or go off-heap.** If native code needs a buffer for the lifetime of a connection, allocate it where it never moves: POH (`pinned: true`), a `DirectByteBuffer`, or C-/native-allocated memory. Do not pin a normal-heap object for minutes.
- **Segregate pinned allocations.** Concentrate pins in a dedicated region (POH on .NET) so they don't perforate the general heap. Scattering pins across gen0/gen2 maximizes the holes.
- **Use stable handles as indirection, not addresses.** When you need a long-lived *identity* across the boundary (a callback context), pass a `GCHandle` (normal, not pinned) or an integer index into a managed table — not a raw address. You get stability of *reference* without forbidding relocation.
- **Treat a pin's lifetime as a resource.** `GCHandle.Free`, `MemoryHandle.Dispose`, `Pinner.Unpin`, `Release…Critical` are all "must run" cleanups. Tie them to `using`/`defer`/`finally` so an exception can't strand a pin.
- **Keep JNI critical regions tiny and non-blocking.** No JNI calls, no I/O, no locks inside `Get…Critical`/`Release…Critical`. If you need to block, copy with `Get…ArrayElements` instead.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Snapshotting a stale address.** `AddrOfPinnedObject` / `&array[0]` / `uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(...))` are only valid *while pinned*. Storing the integer and using it after the pin releases reads moved or freed memory — and `uintptr` specifically is not tracked by the Go GC, so it never keeps anything alive or stable.
- **Pinning an empty array.** `fixed (byte* p = emptyArray)` yields a null pointer in .NET (there's no element zero to pin). Native code that doesn't tolerate null + length-zero will misbehave.
- **Forgetting the JVM may not pin.** `Get…ArrayElements` returning `isCopy == JNI_TRUE` means your writes are invisible until `Release` copies them back. Code that assumes a live view of the array is wrong on copying VMs.
- **GC during a critical region.** If anything inside a JNI critical region triggers a GC (an allocation, a blocking call that lets another thread allocate while GC is globally disabled), you can deadlock or stall every thread. This is why the restrictions exist.
- **cgo retaining Go pointers.** A C callback that stores a Go pointer in a global and uses it after the originating call returns is undefined behavior even if it "works" today — the runtime is allowed to move or collect that object. Pin it, or hand C a copy / a handle index.
- **Interior pointers into moving stacks.** Passing `&localStruct.field` to C is unsafe in Go beyond the call; the stack can move on the next growth. Heap-allocate and pin, or copy into C memory.
- **Pin amplification under load.** A pin held across an `await`/blocking I/O means it spans an unbounded wall-clock window. Under high concurrency this multiplies into many simultaneous long pins — the failure mode that motivated POH and `DirectByteBuffer`.

---

## Summary

Movable heaps buy cheap allocation and low fragmentation by reserving the right to relocate live objects; the collector maintains the illusion of stable references by rewriting every managed pointer. Pinning is the deliberate, scoped surrender of relocation for a single object so a raw address can safely cross into native code, DMA, or the kernel. .NET exposes it directly (`fixed`, `GCHandle`, `Memory<T>.Pin`, and the segregated Pinned Object Heap); the JVM mostly avoids it (copying via `Get…ArrayElements`, narrow pins via `Get…Critical`, off-heap via `DirectByteBuffer`); Go regulates it through cgo pointer rules and the explicit `runtime.Pinner`, with the extra twist that goroutine stacks themselves move. Rust's `Pin<P>` is an unrelated, compile-time guarantee for self-referential types — same word, different problem. The durable lesson: pin briefly and locally, segregate or go off-heap for the long-lived case, and prefer stable *handles* over raw *addresses* whenever you need identity rather than a pointer.
