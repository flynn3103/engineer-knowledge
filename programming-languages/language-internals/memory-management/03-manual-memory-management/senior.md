## Introduction

A senior engineer's job is rarely "call `free` correctly." It is to choose a *memory architecture* that makes whole classes of bugs impossible — or at least cheap to detect — and to understand why three major systems languages made radically different bets to get there.

C says: *you prove correctness in your head.* C++ says: *bind every resource's lifetime to a scope, and let destructors run automatically (RAII).* Rust says: *the compiler proves your ownership and aliasing are sound before the program runs, or it doesn't compile.* These are three points on a single design axis — *where do we move the proof obligation: runtime, scope, or compiler?* Understanding that axis lets you reason about any memory-management decision, including ones in languages not on this list.

This tier is about design: ownership trees, arenas, pools, handles, and the move semantics that make all of it ergonomic.

---

## Prerequisites

- Allocator internals and ownership conventions (middle tier).
- Working knowledge of C++ (constructors/destructors, references) and at least reading-level Rust.
- Familiarity with the failure taxonomy: use-after-free, double-free, leak, overflow, uninitialized read, mismatched/invalid free.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **RAII** | Resource Acquisition Is Initialization — bind a resource's lifetime to an object's lifetime so the destructor releases it. |
| **Smart pointer** | An object that owns a heap allocation and frees it in its destructor (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`). |
| **Move semantics** | Transferring ownership of a resource out of one object into another, leaving the source empty. |
| **Rule of Three/Five/Zero** | C++ guidance on which special member functions a resource-owning class must define. |
| **Arena / region allocator** | Allocate many objects from a bump pointer; free them all at once by resetting the arena. |
| **Pool allocator** | Pre-allocate a slab of fixed-size slots; allocation is a free-list pop. |
| **Generational index / handle** | An index plus a generation counter used instead of a raw pointer, so stale references are detectable. |
| **Borrow** | A temporary, non-owning reference (Rust: checked at compile time). |

## Core Concepts

### RAII: lifetime = scope

The single most important idea in modern C++ memory management is that **you almost never write `free`/`delete` directly.** Instead, you wrap each owned resource in an object whose destructor releases it. When the object goes out of scope — by normal flow, early return, *or an exception* — the destructor runs. Cleanup becomes structural rather than something you remember to do.

```cpp
{
    std::vector<int> v(1000);   // allocates
    // ... 50 lines, early returns, exceptions thrown ...
}   // v's destructor frees the buffer here, unconditionally
```

This solves the problem the C `goto`-ladder solved, but automatically and exception-safely. RAII generalizes far beyond memory: file handles, locks, sockets, transactions — anything with a paired acquire/release.

### Smart pointers and ownership semantics

| Type | Ownership model | Cost | Use when |
|------|-----------------|------|----------|
| `std::unique_ptr<T>` | **Exclusive.** One owner; move-only. | Zero overhead vs raw pointer. | The default for owning a heap object. |
| `std::shared_ptr<T>` | **Shared.** Reference-counted; freed when the last owner dies. | Atomic refcount on copy/destroy. | Genuinely shared, indeterminate-lifetime ownership. |
| `std::weak_ptr<T>` | **Non-owning observer** of a `shared_ptr`. | Cheap. | Break reference cycles; observe without keeping alive. |
| Raw `T*` / `T&` | **Non-owning** (by modern convention). | None. | Borrowing — passing without transferring ownership. |

`std::make_unique<T>(...)` and `std::make_shared<T>(...)` are the preferred constructors: they're exception-safe and, for `make_shared`, fuse the control block and object into one allocation.

The discipline: **`unique_ptr` is the default; reach for `shared_ptr` only when ownership is truly shared.** Overusing `shared_ptr` reintroduces the costs of garbage collection (atomic refcounting) and hides ownership, plus it leaks on reference cycles — `shared_ptr` is *not* a garbage collector.

### Rule of Three / Five / Zero

A class that owns a raw resource must control how it's copied, moved, and destroyed:

- **Rule of Three** (classic): if you define a destructor, copy constructor, *or* copy assignment, you almost certainly need all three — because the default copy does a shallow pointer copy, leading to double-free.
- **Rule of Five** (since C++11): add the move constructor and move assignment to enable cheap ownership transfer.
- **Rule of Zero** (the goal): **own resources through members that already manage themselves** (`unique_ptr`, `vector`, `string`), so your class needs *none* of these — the compiler-generated defaults are correct. Most well-designed classes should follow the Rule of Zero.

### Move semantics

Move is "transfer ownership without copying." `std::move` casts to an rvalue reference, letting a move constructor *steal* the internal pointer and null out the source:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<Widget> a = std::make_unique<Widget>();
std::unique_ptr<Widget> b = std::move(a);  // b owns it; a is now empty (nullptr)
// a is safe to destroy — it owns nothing.
```

This is the C++ encoding of "ownership is a baton passed exactly once." It makes `unique_ptr` zero-cost: returning one from a factory just moves a pointer.

### Rust: ownership as compile-time RAII

Rust takes C++'s RAII and makes it *mandatory and checked*:

- Every value has exactly **one owner**; when the owner goes out of scope, `Drop::drop` runs (RAII).
- Assigning or passing a non-`Copy` value **moves** it; the source is statically unusable afterward — use-after-move is a *compile error*, not UB.
- References are **borrows**, governed by the borrow checker: either one mutable borrow *or* any number of shared borrows, never both, and no borrow may outlive its referent. This statically eliminates use-after-free, data races, and iterator invalidation.

The trade: a steep learning curve and the occasional fight with the borrow checker, in exchange for memory safety *with no garbage collector and no runtime checks*. Where you genuinely need shared ownership, Rust gives you `Rc<T>`/`Arc<T>` (the `shared_ptr` analogue) explicitly, so the cost is visible.

## The Cross-Language Comparison

| Dimension | C | C++ (RAII) | Rust | Managed (Java/Go) |
|-----------|---|------------|------|-------------------|
| Who proves safety | The programmer, mentally | The programmer, via RAII discipline | The compiler (borrow checker) | The runtime (GC) |
| Use-after-free | Possible (UB) | Possible if you bypass RAII | **Impossible** (safe code) | Impossible |
| Double-free | Possible | Prevented by ownership types | **Impossible** | N/A |
| Leaks | Easy | Rare, but cycles in `shared_ptr` leak | Possible (`Rc` cycles) but no UB | Rare; GC handles most |
| Runtime cost | None | None (RAII) / atomic (`shared_ptr`) | None (safe abstractions are zero-cost) | GC pauses, write barriers |
| Determinism | Total | Total | Total | Non-deterministic teardown |
| Escape hatch | n/a | n/a | `unsafe` blocks | JNI/cgo |

The throughline: **the cost of safety doesn't vanish; it moves.** C pushes it to the programmer's discipline and to runtime crashes. C++ moves it to scopes and convention. Rust moves it to compile time. GC languages move it to runtime overhead and pause latency. A senior engineer chooses based on which cost the system can afford — a trading engine cannot afford GC pauses; a CRUD service cannot afford manual-memory CVEs.

## Mental Models

- **Move the proof.** Every memory model is an answer to "where does the safety proof live?" Name the location and the trade-offs follow.
- **Ownership is a tree, not a graph.** Healthy designs form a tree: each node owns its children, parents outlive children, teardown is a post-order walk. Graphs (shared/cyclic ownership) are where `shared_ptr`/`Rc` and leaks live — minimize them.
- **`unique_ptr` is a raw pointer with a conscience.** Same size, same speed, but it cannot forget to free and cannot be copied into a double-free.

---

## Code Examples

### Same problem, three languages

**C — manual, ownership in comments:**
```c
// OWNERSHIP: caller frees with node_free().
Node *node_new(int v) {
    Node *n = malloc(sizeof *n);
    if (!n) return NULL;
    n->value = v; n->next = NULL;
    return n;
}
void node_free(Node *n) { free(n); }
```

**C++ — RAII, ownership in the type:**
```cpp
struct Node {                 // Rule of Zero: members manage themselves
    int value;
    std::unique_ptr<Node> next;   // owns the rest of the list
};
auto n = std::make_unique<Node>(Node{42, nullptr});
// No destructor written; the whole list frees automatically (mind deep recursion).
```

**Rust — ownership in the compiler:**
```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,   // Box owns the heap allocation
}
let n = Box::new(Node { value: 42, next: None });
// Drops automatically at end of scope; use-after-free is a compile error.
```

### Breaking a cycle with `weak_ptr`

```cpp
struct Child;
struct Parent { std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Child>> children; };
struct Child  { std::weak_ptr<Parent> parent; };  // weak, NOT shared — else cycle leaks
```

If `Child` held a `shared_ptr<Parent>`, parent and child would keep each other alive forever — a classic refcount leak. `weak_ptr` observes without owning.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Arena / region allocation

Bump a pointer to allocate; reset once to free everything. Ideal when many objects share a lifetime (a request, a frame, a parse).

```c
typedef struct { char *base; size_t off, cap; } Arena;

void *arena_alloc(Arena *a, size_t n) {
    n = (n + 15) & ~(size_t)15;          // 16-byte align
    if (a->off + n > a->cap) return NULL;
    void *p = a->base + a->off;
    a->off += n;
    return p;                             // no per-object free
}
void arena_reset(Arena *a) { a->off = 0; }   // frees ALL at once
```

Arenas turn N frees into one, eliminate per-object lifetime bugs, and are dramatically faster. The cost: you cannot free individual objects early. Used heavily in compilers (per-AST), game engines (per-frame), and servers (per-request).

### Pool allocator (fixed-size)

For many same-sized objects (e.g. network connections), pre-allocate slots and keep a free list. Allocation is an O(1) list pop; no fragmentation.

### Handles / generational indices

Replace raw pointers with `{ index, generation }`. The container bumps the generation when a slot is freed and reused; a stale handle's generation won't match, so dereferencing fails *detectably* instead of becoming a use-after-free. This is the standard pattern in game engines (entity IDs) and any system with many transient objects referenced across modules.

```c
typedef struct { uint32_t index; uint32_t generation; } Handle;
// lookup() compares handle.generation to slots[index].generation; mismatch => stale.
```

Handles trade a pointer dereference for an index + validity check, buying you safe, relocatable, serializable references.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros (of disciplined manual management)**

- **RAII makes correct cleanup the default**, including on exceptions.
- **Arenas/pools/handles** turn correctness *and* performance problems into structural wins.
- **Zero-cost safety** is achievable (C++ `unique_ptr`, Rust borrow checking).

**Cons**

- **C++ has trap doors**: you can still bypass RAII, alias a `unique_ptr`'s raw pointer, or hit a `shared_ptr` cycle.
- **Rust's discipline has a real learning cost** and can force awkward designs around shared/graph data.
- **Custom allocators add complexity** and must be debugged with the same rigor as the bugs they prevent.

---

## Use Cases

- **C++ codebases**: standardize on RAII + `unique_ptr`, Rule of Zero, `make_unique`; ban raw `new`/`delete` in review.
- **Rust services/systems**: lean on the borrow checker; isolate `unsafe` to small, audited modules.
- **High-throughput systems**: arenas for per-request memory; pools for connection/object churn; handles for entity systems.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Make ownership a type, not a comment.** Prefer `unique_ptr`/`Box` over raw pointers + documentation.
2. **Aim for the Rule of Zero.** Own resources through self-managing members so you write no special member functions.
3. **`unique_ptr` by default; `shared_ptr` only for genuine sharing**, and break cycles with `weak_ptr`.
4. **Model ownership as a tree.** When you reach for shared/cyclic ownership, pause — it's often a design smell.
5. **Reach for arenas/pools/handles** when lifetimes cluster or pointers churn; they fix bugs and speed at once.
6. **In Rust, keep `unsafe` tiny, audited, and wrapped in a safe API.**

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **`shared_ptr` reference cycles leak** silently — refcounting is not garbage collection. Use `weak_ptr`.
- **Self-referential and recursive destructors**: a `unique_ptr`-based linked list of length 100k can blow the stack on destruction (recursive `~Node`); flatten teardown if depth is large.
- **`std::move` then use**: using a moved-from object is valid-but-unspecified in C++ (it's empty), and a *compile error* in Rust. Don't rely on moved-from C++ values.
- **Returning a reference/pointer to a local** (or to an arena that's been reset) is a dangling reference RAII won't catch.
- **`shared_ptr` from a raw pointer twice** creates two independent control blocks → double-free. Use `make_shared` or `enable_shared_from_this`.
- **Arenas hide leaks**: forgetting to reset an arena leaks the whole region; lifetimes must genuinely match.

---

## Summary

- Every memory model answers "**where does the safety proof live?**" — C: in your head; C++: in scopes via RAII; Rust: in the compiler; GC: at runtime.
- **RAII** binds resource lifetime to object lifetime; with `unique_ptr` (default), `shared_ptr` (genuine sharing), and the **Rule of Zero**, modern C++ rarely writes `delete`.
- **Move semantics** encode "ownership passed exactly once" and make exclusive ownership zero-cost.
- **Rust** makes RAII mandatory and the borrow checker proves no use-after-free/double-free at compile time, with `unsafe` as the audited escape hatch.
- **Arenas, pools, and generational handles** are the structural patterns that make manual memory both correct and fast at scale.
- The professional tier covers the production reality: war stories, sanitizers, and where manual memory still wins decisively.
