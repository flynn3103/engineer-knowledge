## Introduction

A senior engineer's job is not to recite "refcounting frees at zero" but to make defensible decisions: *Should this subsystem use reference counting or tracing GC? Which refcount flavor? Where is the cost hiding, and is it worth an optimization that complicates the code?* That requires understanding the deep duality between reference counting and tracing garbage collection — they are, in a precise sense, two ends of the same spectrum — and the catalogue of optimizations (deferred, coalesced, biased) that production systems use to claw back the per-reference cost.

This page assumes you already know the mechanism and cost model. We focus on **trade-offs and engineering judgment.**

## Prerequisites

- The middle-tier cost model: atomic vs non-atomic, inline vs side-table, weak references, cycle collectors.
- A working model of **tracing garbage collection**: mark-and-sweep, generational hypothesis, stop-the-world pauses, throughput vs latency.
- Familiarity with memory ordering (acquire/release semantics) at a conceptual level.

## Glossary

- **Tracing GC** — a collector that periodically determines liveness by walking the reachable object graph from roots, rather than per-reference accounting.
- **Throughput** — fraction of total CPU spent on useful work vs memory management.
- **Latency / pause time** — how long the program is stalled by the memory manager at once.
- **Deferred reference counting** — skipping count updates for references from the stack/registers, reconciling periodically.
- **Coalesced reference counting** — collapsing many intermediate count changes between two observation points into one net change.
- **Biased reference counting** — splitting a count into an owner-thread (non-atomic) part and a shared (atomic) part to avoid atomics on the common single-owner path.
- **Bacon–Rajan cycle collection** — the trial-deletion algorithm CPython-style cyclic collectors are based on; finds cycles by locally subtracting internal references.

## Refcounting vs Tracing GC: The Real Trade-off

The deepest insight (formalized by Bacon, Cheng, and Rajan in "A Unified Theory of Garbage Collection") is that **reference counting and tracing are duals.** Tracing computes liveness by starting from *live* roots and following references forward to find what survives; reference counting computes deadness by tracking when an object's incoming references reach *zero*. Real high-performance collectors are hybrids sitting somewhere between these poles. With that framing, the trade-offs are not religious but quantitative.

| Dimension | Reference Counting | Tracing GC |
|---|---|---|
| **When work happens** | Incrementally, on every reference op | In batches, at collection time |
| **Latency** | No global pauses; smooth | Stop-the-world or concurrent pauses |
| **Throughput** | Often *worse* — pays on every assignment | Often *better* — touches only live objects, amortized |
| **Promptness** | Immediate; finalizers run at last use | Eventual; object lingers until next collection |
| **Cycles** | Cannot reclaim alone | Reclaimed naturally |
| **Memory overhead** | Count per object; near-zero slack | Needs headroom (often 1.5–3×) to be efficient |
| **Cache behavior** | Writes to count = scattered dirtying | Touches live set during trace |
| **Cross-thread cost** | Atomic ops, contention | Synchronization at collection points |

The headline counterintuitive result: **naive reference counting usually has *worse* throughput than a good generational tracing collector**, even though intuition says "freeing immediately must be efficient." The reason is that refcounting does a tiny bit of work on *every* pointer write, including the vast majority of objects that die young and could have been bulk-reclaimed almost for free. Tracing touches only the survivors. This is why JVMs, Go, and high-performance runtimes chose tracing GC, not refcounting, for throughput.

Conversely, refcounting wins decisively on **pause-free determinism, prompt resource release, and predictable memory footprint** — which is why systems languages (C++, Rust) and resource-centric platforms (Swift/Cocoa, with its many OS handles) chose it.

## Advanced Optimizations

Naive refcounting's per-pointer-write cost is the thing to attack. The major techniques:

### Deferred reference counting (DRC)

The observation: the overwhelming majority of reference updates are to **local variables on the stack/in registers** — short-lived, churned constantly. Counting these is pure overhead. DRC **omits count updates for stack references** and instead, periodically, scans the stack to reconcile. Objects whose heap count is zero but which might still be referenced from the stack are placed in a "zero count table" and only freed after a stack scan confirms no stack reference remains. This removes the bulk of count traffic at the price of giving up *some* promptness (an object may briefly outlive its last use until reconciliation).

### Coalesced reference counting

Between two points where the heap is observed, a pointer field may be reassigned many times: A→B→C→D. The *net* effect on counts is only "release the original A, retain the final D"; the intermediate B and C churn cancels out. Coalescing logs the *old* value of a field on its first mutation in an epoch and computes net count deltas in bulk, collapsing many updates into few. This dramatically cuts atomic traffic for hot, frequently-mutated fields.

### Biased reference counting

Designed for the atomic-cost problem and used in **Swift** (and proposed for Python). Most objects are predominantly accessed by **one owning thread**. Biased RC splits the count into two: a **biased (owner-local, non-atomic)** count and a **shared (atomic)** count. The owning thread mutates its non-atomic count cheaply; only *other* threads pay the atomic cost. The two are merged at deallocation. This recovers much of `Rc`-like speed even for shared objects, as long as access is mostly single-owner — which empirically it usually is.

### One-bit / sticky counts and immortal objects

Many objects are referenced exactly once, or are effectively permanent (interned strings, `None`, small integers, type objects). Implementations use **one-bit reference counts** for the common single-reference case (overflow to a side table), and **immortal/sticky** counts that, once "stuck," are never decremented — so truly permanent objects pay zero count traffic. CPython's "immortal objects" (PEP 683) freeze the counts of singletons like `None`, `True`, and small ints precisely so free-threaded Python doesn't contend on their refcounts.

## Cross-Language Implementation Survey

### CPython

- **Inline `ob_refcnt`** in every `PyObject`. Non-atomic, historically GIL-protected.
- **Generational cyclic GC** (3 generations) layered on top, based on Bacon–Rajan trial deletion over container objects.
- **Immortal objects** (PEP 683) and **biased/deferred refcounting** (PEP 703) are the enabling tricks for **free-threaded Python (no-GIL)** — because the GIL's removal exposes every refcount update to contention. Free-threaded Python is *hard* in large part because of refcount contention on shared objects.

### Swift / Objective-C (ARC)

- **Compiler-inserted retain/release.** ARC analyzes object lifetimes at compile time and emits `swift_retain`/`swift_release` calls; there is no runtime GC.
- **Atomic counts** (Swift uses **biased refcounting** to reduce that cost), inline header bits with **side-table** spillover for weak references and overflow.
- **`weak`** (zeroing, becomes `nil` safely) and **`unowned`** (non-zeroing, faster, but unsafe if the object dies first) for cycle breaking.
- Retain cycles in **closures** are the classic Swift bug — a closure captures `self` strongly while `self` retains the closure; fixed with `[weak self]` / `[unowned self]` capture lists.

### Rust

- **`Rc<T>`**: non-atomic, single-thread, cheap. **`Arc<T>`**: atomic, thread-safe, costlier. The split is enforced by the type system (`Rc` is `!Send`).
- **`Weak<T>`** with `strong_count`/`weak_count`; `upgrade()` returns `Option`.
- Counts are inline in the heap allocation alongside the value.
- **No cycle collector** — Rust accepts that cycles *can* leak (`Rc` cycles are safe but leak) and pushes the programmer toward `Weak` or ownership redesign. Leaking is memory-safe in Rust, just wasteful.
- **Interior mutability** (`RefCell`/`Cell` for `Rc`, `Mutex`/`RwLock` for `Arc`) is needed to *mutate* through a shared pointer, since shared `Rc`/`Arc` give shared (immutable) access.

### C++

- **`shared_ptr<T>`** with a **control block** holding the strong count, the weak count, and the deleter. The control block is separately allocated unless you use `make_shared`, which fuses object + control block into one allocation (better locality, one alloc).
- **Atomic** strong/weak counts (always — the standard mandates thread-safe count manipulation, though the *pointee* is not protected).
- **`weak_ptr`** for non-owning references; `.lock()` to upgrade.
- **`enable_shared_from_this`** lets an object hand out `shared_ptr`s to itself without creating a second, independent control block (which would double-free).
- No cycle collection; cycles leak. `weak_ptr` is the prescribed fix.

## Mental Models

- **"Refcounting and tracing are duals."** Don't think "GC vs refcounting"; think "where on the trace↔count spectrum, and with which hybrids." CPython is a literal hybrid.
- **"Naive refcounting trades throughput for latency."** It spreads the cost out (good for pauses) but does *more total work* (bad for throughput). Every advanced optimization is an attempt to recover throughput without losing the latency win.
- **"Atomicity is a tax you can route around."** Biased, deferred, and coalesced counting are all schemes to avoid paying the atomic/per-write tax on the common path.
- **"Cycles are an architectural decision, not a bug to patch."** Whether you use weak refs, a cycle collector, or redesign ownership is a design choice with throughput, complexity, and correctness consequences.

## Code Examples

### Rust: the `Rc`/`Arc` decision and interior mutability

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::sync::Mutex;

// Single-threaded shared, mutable: Rc + RefCell (non-atomic count, non-atomic borrow check)
let shared = Rc::new(RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]));
shared.borrow_mut().push(4);

// Multi-threaded shared, mutable: Arc + Mutex (atomic count, locked data)
let shared_mt = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0u64));
let s2 = Arc::clone(&shared_mt);           // atomic increment
std::thread::spawn(move || { *s2.lock().unwrap() += 1; });
```

The cost asymmetry is explicit in the types: you pay atomic only by writing `Arc`.

### Swift: the closure retain cycle and its fix

```swift
class Downloader {
    var onDone: (() -> Void)?
    func start() {
        // BUG: closure captures self strongly; self holds onDone -> cycle
        onDone = { self.cleanup() }
        // FIX:
        onDone = { [weak self] in self?.cleanup() }
    }
    func cleanup() {}
}
```

### C++: `enable_shared_from_this` to avoid a second control block

```cpp
struct Widget : std::enable_shared_from_this<Widget> {
    std::shared_ptr<Widget> self() {
        return shared_from_this();   // shares the EXISTING control block
        // returning shared_ptr<Widget>(this) would create a SECOND
        // control block -> double free.
    }
};
```

## When Refcounting Wins, When It Loses

**Refcounting wins when:**

- **Pauses are unacceptable** (real-time audio, UI, soft-real-time control). No stop-the-world.
- **Prompt resource release matters** — RAII over OS handles, locks, GPU/DB resources. The destructor runs *now*, at last use.
- **Memory is tight** — refcounting runs close to the live set without the 1.5–3× headroom tracing prefers.
- **Single-threaded or single-owner** access dominates — non-atomic / biased counting is cheap.
- **Predictable footprint** is required (embedded, memory-constrained devices).

**Refcounting loses when:**

- **Raw throughput is king** — server batch processing, compilers, anything where total CPU on GC matters more than pause distribution. Generational tracing wins.
- **Cycles are pervasive and hard to make weak** — arbitrary graph data, doubly-linked structures, observer webs. The cycle collector eats the determinism advantage.
- **Heavy cross-thread sharing of hot objects** — atomic count contention serializes cores. This is the no-GIL Python pain point.
- **Allocation rate is very high with young death** — refcounting pays per-pointer-write even for objects that die immediately; a generational nursery reclaims those almost free.

## Coding Patterns

- **Ownership graph design first.** Decide the *direction* of ownership; make every back-edge weak. Cycles are prevented at design time, not collected at runtime.
- **`make_shared`/`Rc::new` once, clone cheaply** — but be aware each clone is a count op; in hot loops pass `&Rc`/`&Arc` (a borrow) instead of cloning.
- **Confine then share.** Build and mutate objects single-threaded (cheap `Rc`), and only `Arc`-wrap at the point you cross a thread boundary.
- **Immortalize true singletons.** For permanent, widely-shared objects, prefer mechanisms that stop counting them (statics, leaked `'static` refs, immortal objects) to eliminate contention.

## Best Practices

- **Profile count traffic, not just allocations.** A throughput regression from refcounting often shows up as time spent in `retain`/`release`/`Arc::clone`, not in the allocator.
- **Match the flavor to the access pattern.** Single-owner → non-atomic/biased; multi-reader hot object → consider not refcounting it at all (immortal, arena, or borrow).
- **Treat cycles as design smells.** A needed cycle collector in a refcounted system is a signal your ownership model has bidirectional edges; ask whether weak refs or restructuring removes them.
- **Don't fuse control block and object blindly.** `make_shared` improves locality but ties the object's memory lifetime to the *weak* count too — a lingering `weak_ptr` keeps the whole fused block allocated.

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **`make_shared` + long-lived `weak_ptr` = retained storage.** The object's destructor runs at strong-zero, but the *memory* isn't freed until weak-zero because object and control block share one allocation. A `weak_ptr` that outlives everything pins the block.
- **`unowned`/`shared_from_this(this)` foot-guns.** `unowned` access after the object dies is undefined behavior; constructing a second control block from a raw `this` double-frees.
- **Deferred counting weakens promptness.** If you rely on DRC, you lose the "freed exactly at last use" guarantee — destructors may run late.
- **Biased count migration cost.** When an object escapes its owner thread, biased refcounting must transition it to the shared path — a one-time cost that can surprise under sharing-heavy workloads.
- **Cycle collector and finalizers interact badly.** Objects with finalizers inside a cycle complicate collection ordering; CPython historically refused to collect cycles containing objects with `__del__` (relaxed in modern versions, but still subtle).

## Summary

- Reference counting and tracing GC are **duals**; the real engineering question is *where on the spectrum* and *which hybrid*, not "which religion."
- Naive refcounting typically has **worse throughput** but **better latency and promptness** than generational tracing — it does a little work on every pointer write.
- The throughput gap is attacked by **deferred** (skip stack refs), **coalesced** (net out churn), and **biased** (owner-local non-atomic) reference counting, plus **immortal/one-bit** counts for permanent objects.
- Real systems differ sharply: CPython (inline + cyclic GC + immortal objects for no-GIL), Swift/ARC (compiler-inserted, biased, side-table weak), Rust (`Rc`/`Arc`/`Weak`, no collector, leaks are safe), C++ (`shared_ptr` control block, always-atomic, `enable_shared_from_this`).
- **Choose refcounting** for pauses/promptness/footprint/single-owner; **choose tracing** for throughput/pervasive-cycles/high-young-death/heavy-shared-mutation.
