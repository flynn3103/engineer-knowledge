# Memory Layout — Senior Level
> **Topic:** Memory Layout
> **Focus:** Design-level layout decisions — AoS vs. SoA, pointer chasing vs. flat arrays, object-header overhead across managed runtimes, and data-oriented design as an architecture.

---

## Introduction

The lower tiers treated one struct at a time: how to order its fields, when to pack, how to avoid false sharing. The senior tier changes the unit of analysis from the *struct* to the **data structure** and the **access pattern**. Once you have millions of records and a loop that touches them, the dominant question is no longer "how is this struct laid out" but "how is the *collection* laid out relative to how the code traverses it."

Three decisions dominate senior-level layout design:

1. **AoS vs. SoA** — array-of-structs versus struct-of-arrays. The same fields, two physical arrangements, with order-of-magnitude performance differences depending on access pattern.
2. **Pointer-based vs. flat** — linked structures (lists, trees, graphs of heap pointers) versus contiguous arrays. This is the difference between cache-friendly and cache-hostile.
3. **What the runtime adds** — managed languages bolt object headers, GC metadata, and indirection onto your data, changing the layout you thought you designed.

These are not micro-optimizations. They are architectural choices that shape entire subsystems: ECS game engines, columnar databases, vectorized query engines, and high-throughput services are all, at heart, decisions about memory layout.

## Prerequisites

- You are fluent in alignment, padding, cache lines, false sharing, and hot/cold splitting (middle tier).
- You understand the cache hierarchy and rough latencies (L1 ~4 cycles, L3 ~40, DRAM ~200+), and what a TLB miss and a hardware prefetcher are.
- You have profiled real code and read cache-miss counters at least once.
- You can reason about SIMD at a high level (one instruction operating on a vector of 4/8/16 lanes).

---

## Glossary

- **AoS (Array of Structs)** — `struct P { x, y, z; }; P points[N];` — each record's fields are contiguous; records are laid end-to-end.
- **SoA (Struct of Arrays)** — `struct { float x[N], y[N], z[N]; }` — each *field* gets its own contiguous array; one record's fields are scattered across arrays.
- **AoSoA / tiled** — a hybrid: arrays of small SoA blocks (e.g. 8 records' worth of each field), balancing SIMD width and record locality.
- **Pointer chasing** — traversing a structure by dereferencing a pointer to find the next node, where each node may live anywhere in the heap.
- **Data-oriented design (DOD)** — an architecture philosophy: design around how data is transformed in bulk, not around conceptual objects. Layout follows access pattern.
- **Object header** — per-object metadata a managed runtime prepends: identity/lock bits, GC marks, a class/type pointer.
- **Compressed oops** — JVM optimization storing object references as 32-bit offsets (scaled) instead of 64-bit pointers, shrinking headers and references on heaps ≤ 32 GB.
- **Klass pointer** — the JVM's pointer from an object to its class metadata.
- **ECS (Entity-Component-System)** — a game/sim architecture storing components in SoA arrays keyed by entity, enabling cache-efficient bulk system passes.

## Core Concepts

### 1. AoS vs. SoA: the same data, two physical worlds

Consider a particle system with position `(x, y, z)`, velocity, and a color, processed by a physics step that only reads/writes positions and velocities.

**AoS:**

```c
struct Particle { float x, y, z, vx, vy, vz; uint32_t color; };
Particle particles[1_000_000];

for (auto &p : particles)        // update positions
    p.x += p.vx, p.y += p.vy, p.z += p.vz;
```

Each `Particle` is 28 bytes (→ 32 with padding). The physics loop touches 6 of 7 fields, so AoS wastes little here — and AoS is excellent when you operate on *whole records*.

**SoA:**

```c
struct Particles {
    float x[N], y[N], z[N];
    float vx[N], vy[N], vz[N];
    uint32_t color[N];
};
for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++)
    P.x[i] += P.vx[i];   // ... etc
```

Now `x[]` is a dense contiguous array of floats. Three things happen:

- **SIMD becomes trivial.** `x[i] += vx[i]` over a contiguous float array vectorizes to one AVX instruction per 8 elements. The compiler (and you) can load 8 lanes at once. In AoS, `x` values are 32 bytes apart — a *gather*, which SIMD hates.
- **Cache lines carry only useful data.** A 64-byte line of `x[]` holds 16 positions, all of which you use. In AoS, a line holds 2 particles' worth of *all* fields, including `color` you didn't need.
- **Cold fields don't pollute hot scans.** If the physics pass never touches `color`, SoA never loads it.

The flip side: if you need *one whole particle* (e.g., to render a single picked entity), SoA forces 7 separate array accesses across 7 distant regions — 7 cache lines for one record, where AoS needed one.

> **The rule:** choose layout by access pattern. **Operate on one field across many records → SoA.** **Operate on many fields of one record → AoS.** Columnar scans, vectorized math, and bulk filters love SoA; transactional record-at-a-time access loves AoS.

This is exactly why **columnar databases** (Parquet, ClickHouse, DuckDB, Arrow) store data column-by-column: analytics queries scan one column across billions of rows, and SoA makes that bandwidth- and SIMD-optimal. Row stores (Postgres heap, MySQL InnoDB) are AoS, optimal for fetching whole rows in OLTP.

### 2. Pointer chasing vs. flat arrays

A linked list is the canonical cache-hostile structure:

```c
struct Node { int value; struct Node *next; };
```

Each `Node` is heap-allocated, potentially far from its neighbors. Traversal is a chain of dependent loads: you cannot prefetch `next->next` until `next` resolves. Every hop is a likely cache miss (~200 cycles), and the CPU's out-of-order machinery stalls because the address of the next load *depends on* the result of the current one. This is **pointer chasing**, and it is why a linked list can be 10–50× slower to traverse than a flat array holding the same values — despite identical Big-O.

A `vector`/slice/array stores elements contiguously. Traversal is a linear sweep the hardware prefetcher predicts perfectly; misses are amortized across a whole cache line of elements. The same logic indicts:

- **Node-based trees** (red-black trees, generic BSTs) vs. flat/array-backed structures (B-trees with large nodes, sorted arrays, implicit heaps).
- **Hash maps with separate-chaining** vs. open-addressing (Swiss tables / `hashbrown`, Go's bucketized map) which keep entries in flat arrays.
- **Graphs of heap-pointer nodes** vs. CSR (compressed sparse row) adjacency arrays.

The senior instinct: **prefer flat, index-based structures over pointer-based ones for hot traversals.** Replace `*next` pointers with array indices; replace heap-scattered nodes with a backing arena. You keep the algorithm and lose the cache misses.

### 3. Object-header overhead in managed runtimes

In C/Rust/Go (mostly), a struct *is* its fields. In managed runtimes, every heap object carries hidden metadata that dominates the layout of small objects.

**JVM (HotSpot):** each object has a header:
- **Mark word** (8 bytes): identity hash, GC age/mark bits, lock state (biased/lightweight/heavyweight).
- **Klass pointer** (4 bytes with compressed class pointers, else 8): points to the class metadata.
- Plus alignment to 8 bytes.

So an `Integer` wrapping a 4-byte `int` costs **16 bytes** (12-byte header + 4-byte value, padded to 16). A `Long[]` of boxed `Long`s is catastrophic: each element is a pointer (4–8 bytes) to a 16-byte heap object, scattered — pointer chasing plus header bloat. This is the entire reason for primitive arrays, `IntStream`, value types (Project Valhalla), and off-heap columnar storage in JVM data systems.

**Compressed oops** shrink this: on heaps ≤ 32 GB, the JVM stores references as 32-bit values scaled by the 8-byte alignment, so a reference is 4 bytes instead of 8 and the klass pointer is 4 bytes. Crossing the 32 GB heap threshold *disables* compressed oops and can make a larger heap hold *less* live data — a classic capacity-planning trap.

**Go:** objects have **no per-object header**. A struct on the heap is just its fields (the GC tracks metadata in separate span/bitmap structures, not inline). This is why Go structs are compact and why `[]Particle` is genuinely contiguous. The cost is paid elsewhere (the GC's side tables), but your layout is what you wrote.

**Other runtimes:** CPython objects are enormous (refcount + type pointer + per-type fields; a bare `int` object is ~28 bytes), which is why NumPy exists — to store numbers in flat C arrays outside the object model. .NET has an 8-byte object header (sync block + method table pointer) plus 8-byte alignment.

The senior takeaway: **in managed runtimes, the runtime's per-object overhead, not your field layout, often dominates** — and the cure is fewer, bigger objects (struct-of-arrays, primitive arrays, value types, off-heap buffers) rather than millions of tiny ones.

### 4. Data-oriented design as an architecture

DOD inverts OOP's starting question. OOP asks "what *is* this thing?" and bundles its data and behavior into an object. DOD asks "what *transformation* runs over this data, and how is it laid out for that transformation to be fast?" Layout follows access pattern, not conceptual taxonomy.

The flagship is the **ECS** in game engines (Unity DOTS, Bevy, EnTT, Overwatch's engine). Instead of `class Enemy { Transform t; Health h; AI ai; ... }` (AoS objects, virtual dispatch, pointer chasing), you store each **component** in its own SoA array. A *system* (e.g., movement) iterates the `Position` and `Velocity` arrays in lockstep — pure linear, SIMD-friendly, branch-predictable passes over hot data, with cold components never loaded. The same idea powers vectorized query engines and high-frequency trading hot paths.

DOD is not anti-abstraction; it is anti-*pessimistic-default-layout*. It says: for the small set of code that runs millions of times, design the memory layout deliberately and let the access pattern dictate the structure.

## Real-World Analogies

**Spreadsheet stored by row vs. by column.** AoS is a spreadsheet stored row-by-row: great for reading one person's whole record, slow for "average the salary column" (you skip across every row). SoA stores column-by-column: "sum the salary column" is one contiguous sweep, but reading one person means hopping across every column file. Choose by the query you run most.

**A library's books vs. a card catalog.** A flat array is books on one long shelf in order — you walk the shelf, grabbing each in turn. A linked list is a treasure hunt: each book contains a slip telling you which *random* shelf the next book is on. Same books, but the treasure hunt makes you sprint across the building between every read.

**Shipping one product vs. a warehouse audit.** AoS is a fulfillment center optimized to pick one complete order. SoA is optimized to audit "how many of SKU #5 across all orders." Neither layout is wrong; they serve opposite workloads.

---

## Mental Models

- **"Layout is a function of the loop."** There is no globally optimal layout — only a layout optimal for a given traversal. Identify the hottest loop, then lay data out for *it*; accept that other access patterns get slower.
- **"Every pointer hop is a potential 200-cycle stall."** Treat heap pointers in hot paths as expensive. Flatten to indices/arenas where the traversal is hot.
- **"In managed runtimes, count the objects, not the fields."** A million tiny objects = a million headers + a million scattered allocations. One big array = one allocation, zero headers. Prefer the latter.
- **"Bandwidth, not size."** On a bulk scan, performance is bytes-moved-through-cache. SoA wins not because it's smaller but because every byte moved is a byte used.

---

## Code Examples

### Rust — AoS vs. SoA, and SIMD-friendliness

```rust
// AoS: one whole record is contiguous; bulk single-field ops gather.
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
struct ParticleAoS { x: f32, y: f32, z: f32, vx: f32, vy: f32, vz: f32 }

struct ParticlesSoA {
    x: Vec<f32>, y: Vec<f32>, z: Vec<f32>,
    vx: Vec<f32>, vy: Vec<f32>, vz: Vec<f32>,
}

impl ParticlesSoA {
    // This loop is auto-vectorizable: x and vx are dense f32 arrays.
    fn step(&mut self) {
        for i in 0..self.x.len() {
            self.x[i] += self.vx[i];
            self.y[i] += self.vy[i];
            self.z[i] += self.vz[i];
        }
    }
}
// The AoS equivalent strides by sizeof(ParticleAoS) — the loads are 24 bytes
// apart, defeating contiguous SIMD loads and wasting cache-line bandwidth
// on vx/vy/vz the position-only pass might not need.
```

### Go — flat indices instead of pointer chasing

```go
// Pointer-based tree: each node is a separate, scattered allocation.
type NodePtr struct {
    Value       int
    Left, Right *NodePtr // chasing these is a cache miss per hop
}

// Arena/flat tree: nodes live in one contiguous slice; "pointers" are indices.
type Arena struct {
    Value       []int
    Left, Right []int32 // -1 == nil; indices into the same arrays
}

func (a *Arena) sum(i int32) int {
    if i < 0 {
        return 0
    }
    // Children are nearby in the backing arrays -> prefetcher-friendly,
    // and traversal order can be made contiguous by build order.
    return a.Value[i] + a.sum(a.Left[i]) + a.sum(a.Right[i])
}
```

### Java — header overhead and the boxing trap

```java
// Each boxed Long: 12-byte header + 8-byte value + padding = 24 bytes,
// PLUS an 8-byte reference in the array, scattered across the heap.
Long[] boxed = new Long[1_000_000];   // ~32 MB + pointer chasing on iterate

// Primitive array: pure contiguous 8-byte longs, one allocation, no headers.
long[] flat = new long[1_000_000];    // exactly 8 MB, dense, SIMD-able

// On heaps <= 32 GB, compressed oops make references 4 bytes; cross 32 GB
// and references jump to 8 bytes — a bigger heap can hold less live data.
```

## Pros & Cons

| Choice | Favors | Pays |
|--------|--------|------|
| **AoS** | Whole-record access, OLTP, locality of one entity, simpler code | Wastes line bandwidth on bulk single-field scans; poor SIMD |
| **SoA** | Bulk single-field scans, SIMD/vectorization, columnar analytics, cold-field exclusion | Whole-record access is N scattered reads; more bookkeeping; harder to mutate record count |
| **AoSoA** | Balance of SIMD width and record locality | Complex indexing; tuning the tile size |
| **Flat/arena** | Cache-friendly traversal, no per-node alloc, no chasing | Manual lifetime mgmt; resizing/relocation; index invalidation |
| **Pointer-based** | Easy insert/delete, stable addresses, natural recursion | Cache misses per hop; allocation overhead; no prefetch |

---

## Use Cases

- **SoA / columnar:** analytics databases (ClickHouse, DuckDB, Arrow, Parquet), vectorized query engines, ML feature stores, particle/physics systems, signal processing.
- **AoS / row store:** OLTP databases, request handlers fetching whole entities, anything record-at-a-time.
- **Flat/arena over pointers:** parsers (AST in an arena/index vector), game scene graphs, ECS, compilers (region allocation), high-throughput servers.
- **Managed-runtime mitigations:** primitive arrays over boxed collections, value types/records, off-heap buffers (Netty, Arrow, mapped files), `@JvmInline`/struct value types.

---

## Coding Patterns

- **Structure-of-arrays transform:** take a hot `[]Struct`, split each field into a parallel array, and rewrite hot loops to iterate one field at a time. Keep an AoS "view" for rare whole-record access.
- **Index-as-pointer (arena):** replace `*Node` with `int32` indices into shared backing arrays; `-1`/sentinel for null. Enables compact serialization and cache locality.
- **Component arrays (ECS):** store each component type in its own dense array; iterate the intersection of component sets in systems.
- **Off-heap / value-type escape hatch:** in managed runtimes, move bulk numeric data out of the object model entirely (primitive arrays, direct `ByteBuffer`, Arrow vectors) to dodge headers and chasing.
- **AoSoA tiling:** group records into tiles of `K` (e.g. SIMD width), SoA within a tile, AoS across tiles — when you need both SIMD and decent single-record locality.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Pick layout from the hottest access pattern, and write it down.** Document "this is SoA because the analytics scan dominates"; the next engineer will otherwise "fix" it into AoS.
2. **Default to flat, index-based structures in hot paths.** Reach for pointer-based structures only when insert/delete churn or stable addressing genuinely demands it.
3. **In managed runtimes, minimize object count for bulk data.** Prefer primitive arrays, value types, and off-heap buffers over millions of small objects.
4. **Keep AoS↔SoA reversible.** Encapsulate the layout behind an interface so you can switch when profiling demands, without rewriting callers.
5. **Watch the 32 GB JVM cliff.** Size heaps to stay under compressed-oops threshold, or accept the reference-size jump consciously.
6. **Validate with profiling, not theory.** Confirm cache-miss reduction and vectorization actually happened (covered in the professional tier).

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **SoA hurts when you actually need whole records.** A mixed workload (bulk scans *and* record fetches) may need both representations or an AoSoA compromise — don't dogmatically pick one.
- **SoA mutation of record count is painful.** Inserting/removing a record means editing every parallel array consistently; a bug desyncs them silently.
- **"Linked lists are always bad" is too strong.** For small N, intrusive lists with good allocation locality, or workloads dominated by O(1) splice/move, lists can win. The indictment is about *cache-hostile traversal at scale*.
- **Auto-vectorization is fragile.** SoA enables SIMD but doesn't guarantee it; aliasing, non-contiguous access, or branches inside the loop can block the compiler. Check the generated assembly.
- **Compressed oops surprise across the heap cliff.** Increasing `-Xmx` past ~32 GB can *reduce* effective capacity and slow everything down.
- **Arena indices are not lifetime-safe.** A stale `int32` index outliving its slot (after compaction/reuse) is a use-after-free analog with no type-system protection.
- **False sharing returns in SoA.** Parallel writers each owning a *slice* of the same field array can false-share at slice boundaries; align partitions to cache lines.
- **Padding interacts with AoS strides.** A poorly ordered AoS struct inflates the stride, multiplying wasted bandwidth across the whole array — junior-tier ordering still matters here.

---

## Summary

- At senior scale, the unit of analysis is the **collection and its access pattern**, not the lone struct.
- **AoS vs. SoA** is chosen by the loop: SoA for bulk single-field scans, SIMD, and columnar analytics; AoS for whole-record access and OLTP. The same fields, two physical worlds, with order-of-magnitude consequences.
- **Pointer chasing** (linked lists, node trees, chained maps, heap-pointer graphs) is cache-hostile: each hop is a dependent, unprefetchable, likely-miss load. Prefer **flat, index/arena-based** structures in hot traversals.
- **Managed runtimes** add per-object headers (JVM mark word + klass pointer; .NET sync block + method table; CPython refcount + type) that dominate small-object layout; **Go has no per-object header**. The cure is fewer, bigger objects — primitive arrays, value types, off-heap buffers — and awareness of **compressed-oops** and the 32 GB JVM cliff.
- **Data-oriented design** makes layout an architecture: design memory around the transformation, as in ECS engines and columnar/vectorized databases.
- There is no universally best layout — only one optimal for a given access pattern. Choose deliberately, document the choice, and verify with profiling.

Next, the **professional** tier turns this into measured performance engineering: `perf c2c`, `pahole`, cache-miss counters, and quantifying every claim above.
