# Annotations & Decorators — Professional Level

> **Topic:** Annotations & Decorators
> **Focus:** Architectural decisions at scale — compile-time vs runtime as a system-wide strategy, the TC39 Stage-3 decorator transition, build-performance and startup budgets, debugging framework "magic," and the governance of declarative metadata across a large codebase.

## Introduction

> Focus: **At this level the question is no longer "how does a decorator work" but "what is our org's strategy for declarative metadata, and what does it cost us in build time, startup time, debuggability, and migration risk?"**

A professional owns the consequences. Annotations and decorators are not features you sprinkle on code — they are an architectural commitment. Choosing Spring's runtime reflection vs Micronaut's compile-time generation sets your startup latency and native-image story for years. Adopting Lombok ties your build to compiler internals. Building a routing layer on TypeScript decorators bets on a feature that is *mid-transition* from a non-standard "experimental" design to the TC39 Stage-3 standard — a migration that can break every decorator you've written.

This page covers the decisions and the failure modes that only show up at scale:

- **Compile-time vs runtime as a platform strategy**, including cold-start economics (serverless), native images (GraalVM), and the industry shift from reflection to codegen.
- **The TC39 Stage-3 decorator transition** — what changed from `experimentalDecorators`, why parameter decorators didn't make it, and how to manage a codebase straddling both.
- **Build-performance engineering** for annotation processors — incremental processing, processor ordering, and keeping a monorepo's `javac`/`tsc` times sane.
- **Debugging "action at a distance"** — the methodology for the production incident caused by an invisible annotation, a proxy that didn't apply, or a decorator stacking bug.
- **Governance** — how to keep declarative metadata from becoming an undebuggable web of magic that no one understands.

The recurring senior axis (compile vs runtime) is now a *line item in your latency and risk budget*. You're the one who signs off on it.

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Senior-level understanding of APT rounds/codegen, Lombok AST mutation, Spring reflection scanning, and the `reflect-metadata` DI pipeline.
- **Required:** Experience operating a real service: cold starts, startup time, build pipelines.
- **Required:** Awareness that TypeScript decorators exist in two incompatible flavors.
- **Helpful but not required:** Exposure to GraalVM native image, serverless cold-start tuning, or a monorepo build (Bazel/Gradle/Nx).

You do **not** need:

- To have personally shipped a TC39 decorator migration (but you should be able to plan one).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **TC39 Stage-3 decorators** | The standardized JS decorator proposal (now in TypeScript 5.0+ and shipping engines), distinct from the old experimental design. |
| **`experimentalDecorators`** | The legacy TS flag enabling the pre-standard decorator semantics Angular/Nest still rely on. |
| **Parameter decorators** | Decorators on constructor/method parameters; supported by the legacy design, **not** by Stage-3. |
| **Native image** | An ahead-of-time-compiled binary (GraalVM) with no JIT and limited runtime reflection — hostile to reflection-heavy frameworks. |
| **Cold start** | The latency to initialize a process from scratch (serverless), dominated by classpath scanning and reflection in classic frameworks. |
| **Reachability metadata** | Config telling GraalVM which reflective/annotation accesses to keep, since it can't see them statically. |
| **Incremental annotation processing** | Gradle/`javac` capability to reprocess only changed inputs, keeping builds fast. |
| **Aggregating vs isolating processor** | Incremental-processing categories: isolating processors map one input to one output (fast); aggregating ones may read many inputs (slower to invalidate). |
| **AOP proxy** | A generated wrapper (JDK dynamic proxy or CGLIB subclass) implementing `@Transactional`/`@Async`/`@Cacheable`. |
| **Action at a distance** | Behavior caused by metadata/decorators not visible at the call site — the dominant debuggability cost. |
| **Metadata governance** | Policies/lint/ownership ensuring declarative metadata stays discoverable and consistent. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. Compile-time vs runtime is a platform-level latency decision

The whole industry has been re-litigating this trade-off, and as a professional you must take a side per workload:

- **Runtime reflection (classic Spring, Hibernate, Jackson default):** fastest to develop, most dynamic, but pays **startup scanning** and **reflection cost** on every cold start. On a long-lived monolith this amortizes to nothing. On a serverless function invoked cold thousands of times, or under a native image with reflection disabled, it's a serious liability.
- **Compile-time generation (Dagger, Micronaut, Quarkus, Spring Native/AOT):** slower builds, but near-instant startup, native-image compatibility, and compile-time error detection. This is why the cloud-native ecosystem pushed DI/AOP to build time.

The decision drives concrete numbers: a reflection-heavy Spring app might cold-start in seconds; the equivalent Quarkus/Micronaut app in tens of milliseconds. If your SLO or cost model is cold-start-sensitive, the column you pick *is* the architecture.

### 2. The TC39 Stage-3 decorator transition — the migration you must plan

TypeScript decorators have been "experimental" for a decade. The TC39 committee standardized a **different** design (Stage-3), shipped in TypeScript 5.0 and modern engines. The differences are not cosmetic:

- **Different decorator signatures.** Stage-3 decorators receive a `(value, context)` pair; the legacy design received `(target, key, descriptor)`. Existing decorators do not work unchanged.
- **No parameter decorators in Stage-3.** The legacy design's parameter decorators — which Angular and NestJS use heavily for `@Inject()` and DI — **are not part of the standard**. Frameworks depending on them must keep `experimentalDecorators` or find another mechanism.
- **`emitDecoratorMetadata` is a legacy concept.** The standard doesn't define design-type metadata emission, so the entire `reflect-metadata`-based DI approach is tied to the legacy mode.

The practical consequence: **Angular and NestJS still run on the legacy decorators** (`experimentalDecorators: true`), while new general-purpose libraries adopt Stage-3. A large org typically ends up with both, segregated by package, and must prevent accidental flag flips that break DI. Planning this migration — or deliberately *not* migrating the DI-heavy parts — is a real professional responsibility.

### 3. Native images and reflection: the reachability problem

GraalVM native images compile ahead of time and **cannot follow arbitrary runtime reflection**. Any annotation read via reflection, any class loaded by name, any proxy generated at runtime must be declared in **reachability metadata** or it fails at native runtime. This is why:

- Reflection-heavy frameworks ship native-image agents and AOT processors that *pre-compute* the reflection config at build time — effectively converting runtime annotation processing into compile-time processing.
- Compile-time frameworks (Dagger, Micronaut) are natively native-image-friendly: there's nothing to reflect on.

If native images are on your roadmap, your annotation strategy is half the battle.

### 4. Build-performance engineering for processors

Annotation processors can wreck build times. At scale you manage:

- **Incremental processing.** Gradle classifies processors as *isolating* (one input → one output, cheap to re-run on change) or *aggregating* (may read across inputs, invalidates broadly). Prefer isolating processors; an aggregating processor in a large module forces near-full reprocessing on any change.
- **Processor ordering and rounds.** Multiple processors generating code that other processors consume increases rounds and build time; minimize cross-processor dependencies.
- **Caching.** Build caches (Gradle, Bazel) can skip processing entirely on cache hits — but only if the processor is deterministic and declares its inputs honestly. Non-deterministic generators poison the cache.

A processor that adds a second per module across a 500-module monorepo adds eight minutes to every build. This is a line item leadership notices.

### 5. AOP proxies and their leaky semantics

Spring's `@Transactional`, `@Cacheable`, `@Async`, `@Retryable`, and security annotations are implemented by **proxies**. The professional-level traps:

- **Self-invocation bypasses the proxy.** `this.cachedMethod()` from within the same bean does not go through the proxy, so the annotation is silently ignored. This causes "the cache isn't working / the transaction didn't roll back" incidents that are invisible in code review.
- **`final` methods/classes can't be proxied by CGLIB**, silently dropping the behavior.
- **Proxy creation order** interacts with bean initialization; an annotation applied to a bean used during early startup may not yet be wrapped.

Owning a Spring codebase means owning these semantics and teaching them, because they are pure action-at-a-distance.

### 6. Debugging action at a distance

The defining cost of annotations/decorators is that behavior is *not visible at the call site*. The professional methodology for the inevitable "why did this happen?" incident:

1. **Identify the reader.** Which subsystem acts on this annotation/decorator? (Compiler? Processor? Spring proxy? Angular injector?)
2. **Confirm the reader actually ran.** Right retention? Right flag? Decorator present? Proxy applied (not self-invoked)?
3. **Inspect the generated/woven artifact.** Read the generated source (Dagger), decompile the class (Lombok), or dump the proxy chain (Spring `AopUtils`).
4. **Reproduce in isolation** with the annotation removed/added to bisect the effect.

The discipline mirrors any action-at-a-distance debugging: make the invisible reader visible before proposing a fix.

### 7. Governance: keeping declarative magic debuggable

Unchecked, annotations metastasize into an unreadable web. Governance levers:

- **Catalog your custom annotations** and their readers in one place.
- **Lint for misuse:** missing retention, decorator-stacking order (auth-before-cache), required TS metadata flags.
- **Cap the "magic budget."** Prefer a small set of well-understood annotations over a bespoke one per feature.
- **Make readers discoverable.** Anyone should be able to jump from `@Custom` to the code that consumes it.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Real-world thing |
|---------|------------------|
| **Runtime vs compile-time strategy** | Stocking a store nightly (compile-time, slow prep, instant open) vs sourcing each item as a customer asks (runtime, no prep, slow checkout). |
| **TC39 transition** | Changing a country's electrical plug standard while half the appliances are wired for the old one — adapters everywhere, careful migration. |
| **Native-image reachability metadata** | A customs manifest: anything not declared in advance is refused entry, because inspectors can't improvise. |
| **AOP proxy self-invocation** | A reception desk that screens visitors — but staff walking in through the back door are never screened. |
| **Incremental processing** | Re-cooking only the dish a diner changed, not the whole banquet, when one order is amended. |
| **Metadata governance** | A building-code registry: every plaque, sticker, and label is catalogued, so no mystery notes accumulate. |

## Mental Models

### The "Latency Budget Line Item" Model

Treat your annotation strategy as an explicit entry in two budgets: **build time** (processors, codegen) and **startup time** (scanning, reflection, proxying). Every annotation either costs at build or at startup. A professional knows the number for their system and defends it.

### The "Migration Blast Radius" Model

Before adopting a decorator-based framework, ask: *if the decorator standard or the framework's flag changes, how many files break?* TC39's transition makes this concrete. Bound the blast radius by isolating decorator usage behind your own thin wrappers where feasible.

### The "Reader-First Debugging" Model

When metadata-driven behavior misfires, never start at the call site (the behavior isn't there). Start at the **reader**: did it run, could it see the metadata, did it apply. This inverts normal debugging and is the single highest-value habit for annotation-heavy systems.

---

## Code Examples

### TypeScript — legacy vs Stage-3 decorator signatures

```typescript
// LEGACY (experimentalDecorators: true) — what Angular/Nest use
function LegacyLog(target: any, key: string, desc: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const orig = desc.value;
  desc.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`call ${key}`);
    return orig.apply(this, args);
  };
}

// TC39 STAGE-3 — the standard (TS 5+, modern engines)
function Stage3Log(orig: Function, ctx: ClassMethodDecoratorContext) {
  return function (this: any, ...args: any[]) {
    console.log(`call ${String(ctx.name)}`);
    return orig.apply(this, args);
  };
}
```

The signatures are incompatible. A codebase cannot trivially flip flags: every decorator must be ported. Worse, **parameter decorators** (used by `@Inject()`) exist only in the legacy design, so DI-heavy frameworks are pinned to legacy until they re-architect. Planning around this is the core TS-decorator professional concern.

### Java — making a processor incremental (Gradle isolating)

```java
// An isolating processor: each annotated type maps to exactly one generated file,
// and the generated file depends only on that one originating element.
@SupportedAnnotationTypes("com.example.Value")
@SupportedOptions("org.gradle.annotation.processing.isolating")  // declare isolating
public class ValueProcessor extends AbstractProcessor {
    @Override public boolean process(Set<? extends TypeElement> a, RoundEnvironment r) {
        for (Element e : r.getElementsAnnotatedWith(Value.class)) {
            // Pass the originating element so Gradle can track the 1:1 dependency:
            // filer.createSourceFile(name, e);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

Declaring the processor *isolating* lets Gradle reprocess only changed inputs. An aggregating processor (one that reads all `@Value` types to emit a single registry) invalidates broadly and slows incremental builds — a deliberate trade-off you must make consciously.

### Spring — the self-invocation trap and the fix

```java
@Service
class OrderService {
    @Transactional
    public void place(Order o) { /* ... */ }

    public void placeMany(List<Order> orders) {
        for (Order o : orders) {
            this.place(o);          // BUG: self-call bypasses the proxy — NO transaction
        }
    }
}
```

Fix options: inject the bean into itself (`@Autowired private OrderService self;` then `self.place(o)`), split into two beans, or use `TransactionTemplate` programmatically. The annotation *looks* applied but the proxy never sees the internal call. This is a top production-incident source in Spring shops.

### GraalVM — declaring reflection reachability for a runtime-read annotation

```json
// reflect-config.json — tells native-image to keep reflective access
[
  {
    "name": "com.example.Entity",
    "allDeclaredFields": true,
    "allDeclaredMethods": true,
    "annotations": true
  }
]
```

Under a native image, the JVM-time reflection that read `@Entity` no longer works automatically; the framework's AOT processor (or you) must emit this metadata so the native binary keeps the access. This is runtime annotation processing being forced back to build time by the platform.

### Python — feature-flagging a decorator to bound blast radius

```python
import functools, os

def feature(name):
    def deco(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*a, **k):
            if not _enabled(name):
                raise RuntimeError(f"feature {name} disabled")
            return func(*a, **k)
        wrapper.__feature__ = name      # metadata for governance/auditing
        return wrapper
    return deco

def _enabled(name): return os.getenv(f"FEATURE_{name.upper()}") == "1"
```

The decorator centralizes a cross-cutting policy *and* tags the function with discoverable metadata (`__feature__`) so tooling can audit every gated entry point — combining behavior and governance.

## Pros & Cons

| Aspect | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Runtime-reflection platforms** | Fast dev loop, dynamic, mature ecosystem. | Cold-start cost; native-image hostile; runtime-discovered errors. |
| **Compile-time platforms** | Instant startup; native-image ready; build-time errors. | Slower builds; steeper learning curve; codegen unfamiliarity. |
| **TS decorators (legacy)** | Enables rich DI (parameter decorators, design types). | Non-standard; tied to `experimentalDecorators`; migration risk. |
| **TS decorators (Stage-3)** | Standardized, future-proof, engine-supported. | No parameter decorators; no design-metadata; breaks existing DI patterns. |
| **AOP proxies** | Declarative transactions/caching/retry with no boilerplate. | Self-invocation and `final` traps; invisible failures; proxy overhead. |
| **Heavy declarative metadata** | Concise, intention-revealing code. | Action at a distance; debuggability and onboarding cost; magic sprawl. |

## Use Cases

- **Serverless / cold-start-sensitive services:** prefer compile-time DI (Micronaut/Quarkus/Dagger) to slash init latency.
- **Native-image deployments:** annotation strategy must avoid or pre-compute runtime reflection.
- **Long-lived monoliths:** runtime reflection's startup cost amortizes; developer velocity may win.
- **Large TS monorepos:** segregate legacy-decorator (Angular/Nest) packages from Stage-3 packages; lint the flags.
- **High-throughput request paths:** avoid per-request reflection; generate or cache aggressively.
- **Regulated/auditable systems:** use annotations/decorators as governance hooks (auth, audit, feature flags) with cataloguing.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pick the processing time per workload, not per org

Use compile-time generation for cold-start- or native-image-bound services; runtime reflection where dynamism and velocity dominate. Don't mandate one globally; mandate the *decision criteria*.

### Pattern 2: Isolate decorator usage behind your own abstraction

Wrap framework decorators in thin local equivalents so a future standard/flag change has a small blast radius and one place to port.

### Pattern 3: Lint the invisible requirements

Enforce: retention matches reader; TS metadata flags + `reflect-metadata` import present; security decorators outermost; no self-invocation of proxied methods (where statically detectable).

### Pattern 4: Make every custom annotation traceable to its reader

Doc-comment the consumer, add a test asserting the reader acts, and keep a central catalog. No orphan annotations.

---

## Best Practices

- **Budget annotation cost explicitly.** Know your build-time and startup-time numbers; defend them in design reviews.
- **Decide TC39 vs legacy decorators consciously, per package,** and lint to prevent accidental flag flips that break DI.
- **Plan for native images early** if they're on the roadmap; an annotation strategy retrofit is expensive.
- **Prefer isolating annotation processors** and honest input declarations to keep incremental builds and caches effective.
- **Teach the proxy traps.** Self-invocation and `final` are recurring incidents; make them part of onboarding and code review.
- **Debug reader-first.** For metadata-driven misbehavior, verify the reader ran and could see the metadata before anything else.
- **Govern the magic.** Catalog custom annotations, cap their count, keep readers discoverable, and lint stacking order.
- **Inspect generated/woven output** when in doubt — read Dagger's output, decompile Lombok's classes, dump Spring's proxy chain.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Flag-flip catastrophe.** Toggling `experimentalDecorators` or upgrading TS without porting decorators breaks every parameter-decorator-based DI site at once.
- **Native-image runtime reflection failure.** An annotation read reflectively works on the JVM but throws on the native binary unless reachability metadata was generated — caught late, in production-like environments only.
- **Aggregating-processor build blowups.** A single aggregating processor in a large module turns incremental builds into near-full rebuilds; CI times balloon mysteriously.
- **Spring self-invocation.** `this.transactionalMethod()` silently skips the transaction/cache/retry — invisible in review, surfaces as data inconsistency in prod.
- **`final` defeats CGLIB proxies.** Marking a `@Transactional` class/method `final` silently disables the behavior.
- **Cold-start regressions from added scanning.** Adding a component-scan path or a reflection-heavy library quietly raises p99 cold-start latency; only visible under load with cold instances.
- **Decorator stacking security holes at scale.** A shared `@cache` decorator placed outside `@authorize` across many endpoints leaks data; a single review miss replicates the bug widely.
- **Orphaned annotations.** A custom annotation whose reader was deleted (or whose retention was changed) becomes silent dead weight that misleads readers into thinking behavior exists.
- **Generated-source drift.** Committing generated sources causes merge conflicts and stale outputs; always regenerate in the build.
- **Cache poisoning by non-deterministic processors.** A processor whose output varies (timestamps, map ordering) breaks build caches and reproducibility.
- **`reflect-metadata` global collisions.** Multiple polyfill versions or bundlers stripping the import cause intermittent, environment-specific DI failures.
