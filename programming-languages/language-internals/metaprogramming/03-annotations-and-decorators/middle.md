## Introduction

> Focus: **The junior page told you annotations are inert metadata and decorators are live code. Now you learn the machinery: *how* each is processed, and the full toolkit for building both.**

At junior level you could classify any `@Something` as metadata or behavior and name its reader. That's the conceptual foundation. This page makes you *productive*: you'll be able to define your own annotations with the right **retention** and **targets**, understand the deep split between **compile-time processing (APT)** and **runtime reflection**, and on the decorator side, write **decorator factories** (decorators that take arguments), **class decorators**, and correctly handle **stacking** and **metadata preservation**.

The unifying axis to hold in your head — and it mirrors the whole metaprogramming section — is **when does the work happen?**

- **Compile time:** Java annotation processors (APT) and tools like Lombok and Dagger read annotations *during the build* and generate code or errors. The result is baked in before the program ever runs.
- **Runtime:** frameworks read annotations *while the program runs*, via reflection (Spring, JUnit, Jackson, Hibernate). Python and TypeScript decorators run at *definition time* — a third moment, between "build" and "steady-state runtime."

Once you can place any `@`-feature on this timeline — when it's read, by whom, to what effect — the "magic" disappears and you can reason about cost, ordering, and failure modes.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** The junior page's core split: annotation = inert metadata read by someone else; decorator = live wrapping code.
- **Required:** Comfort writing a Python decorator and a basic Java class.
- **Required:** Knowing what reflection is (inspecting types/methods at runtime).
- **Helpful but not required:** Having seen a build tool (Maven/Gradle, `javac`) run, and the idea of generated source folders.
- **Helpful but not required:** Familiarity with closures (a function capturing variables from an enclosing scope) — decorator factories rely on them.

You do **not** yet need:

- The internals of writing a full `javax.annotation.processing.Processor` round-by-round (that's `senior.md`).
- `reflect-metadata` design-type emission internals (that's `senior.md`).
- TC39 Stage-3 vs legacy `experimentalDecorators` differences (that's `professional.md`).

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Retention policy** | (Java) `SOURCE`, `CLASS`, or `RUNTIME` — how long an annotation survives the compilation pipeline. |
| **`@Target`** | A meta-annotation restricting *where* an annotation may be applied (method, field, type, parameter…). |
| **Meta-annotation** | An annotation placed on *another annotation's definition* (`@Retention`, `@Target`, `@Documented`, `@Inherited`). |
| **APT** | Annotation Processing Tool: the `javac` mechanism that runs `Processor`s at compile time. |
| **`javax.annotation.processing`** | The Java API for writing annotation processors. |
| **Code generation** | A processor emitting *new* source files during compilation (Dagger, Lombok-ish, MapStruct). |
| **Reflection scanning** | Walking loaded classes at runtime to find annotated elements (Spring component scan). |
| **Decorator factory** | A function returning a decorator, used to pass arguments: `@retry(times=3)`. |
| **Class decorator** | A decorator applied to a class rather than a function; receives and may replace the class. |
| **Stacking** | Applying multiple decorators/annotations to one target; order is significant. |
| **`functools.wraps`** | Copies `__name__`, `__doc__`, `__wrapped__`, `__dict__`, signature onto the wrapper. |
| **Definition time** | When a Python/TS decorator executes — as the `def`/`class` statement is evaluated. |
| **Element** | (Java) The thing an annotation is attached to, as seen by a processor: `TypeElement`, `ExecutableElement`, etc. |
| **`@Repeatable`** | A meta-annotation allowing the same annotation to be applied more than once to one target. |
| **Marker annotation** | An annotation with no members; its mere presence is the signal (`@Override`, `@Deprecated`). |

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Retention: the lifecycle knob that decides *who can read it*

A Java annotation's `@Retention` is the most important property you set, because it decides which readers can even see it:

| Retention | Survives to | Who can read it | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| `SOURCE` | source only; discarded by `javac` | annotation **processors** at compile time; never available at runtime | `@Override`, Lombok's `@Getter` |
| `CLASS` | the `.class` file, but not loaded for reflection | bytecode tools, some weavers | default if unspecified; rarely used directly |
| `RUNTIME` | `.class` file *and* loadable via reflection | **frameworks** at runtime (Spring, JUnit, Jackson) | `@Test`, `@Entity`, `@JsonProperty` |

The rule of thumb: **`SOURCE` = "a compile-time tool will consume me and I'll vanish." `RUNTIME` = "a framework will reflect on me while the app runs."** If you write a custom annotation that a runtime framework must see, and you forget `@Retention(RUNTIME)`, the framework will silently find nothing — a notorious bug.

### 2. `@Target`: where an annotation may legally appear

`@Target` restricts the application sites: `TYPE`, `METHOD`, `FIELD`, `PARAMETER`, `CONSTRUCTOR`, `ANNOTATION_TYPE`, `TYPE_PARAMETER`, `TYPE_USE`, etc. Putting an annotation where its `@Target` forbids is a compile error. This is how `@Override` is rejected on a field — its target is `METHOD` only.

### 3. Meta-annotations: annotations on annotations

You configure an annotation by annotating *its definition*:

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)   // meta-annotation
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)           // meta-annotation
public @interface Benchmark { }
```

`@Retention` and `@Target` are themselves annotations applied to `@Benchmark`. Other meta-annotations: `@Inherited` (subclasses inherit the annotation), `@Documented` (appears in Javadoc), `@Repeatable` (apply more than once).

### 4. The two processing paths, concretely

This is the heart of the topic. An annotation becomes meaningful in exactly one of two ways:

**(a) Compile-time processing (APT).** During `javac`, registered `Processor`s receive the set of annotated elements in *rounds*. A processor may:
- **Generate code** — write new `.java` files (Dagger writes DI graphs; MapStruct writes mappers; AutoValue writes value classes). The generated code is compiled in a later round.
- **Validate** — raise compile errors/warnings (e.g., "an `@Entity` must have a no-arg constructor").

Lombok is a special, controversial case: it uses the annotation-processing hook but *mutates the AST in place* to inject getters/setters rather than generating separate files — relying on internal compiler APIs (more in `senior.md` and `professional.md`).

**(b) Runtime reflection.** With `RUNTIME` retention, a framework at startup or on demand scans classes and reacts:
```java
for (Method m : clazz.getDeclaredMethods())
    if (m.isAnnotationPresent(Test.class))
        runAsTest(m);
```
Spring's component scan, JUnit's test discovery, Jackson's field mapping, and Hibernate's entity mapping all do versions of this.

**Cost trade-off:** compile-time processing makes the *build* slower but the *runtime* free; runtime reflection makes the *build* untouched but adds *startup* cost (scanning) and per-call reflection cost. This trade-off is the through-line of the whole section.

### 5. Decorator factories: decorators that take arguments

A plain decorator takes a function and returns a function. But `@retry(times=3)` needs an argument. The trick: `retry(times=3)` is *called first*, and must *return a decorator*. So you need three nested layers:

```python
def retry(times):                       # 1. factory: takes the argument
    def decorator(func):                 # 2. the actual decorator
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):    # 3. the wrapper
            for attempt in range(times):
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception:
                    if attempt == times - 1:
                        raise
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

`@retry(times=3)` evaluates `retry(3)` → returns `decorator` → `decorator(func)` → returns `wrapper`. **Parentheses mean "factory."** No parentheses means "the name *is* the decorator." Mixing these up is the most common decorator error.

### 6. Class decorators

A decorator can wrap a *class*, receiving the class and returning a (possibly modified or replaced) class:

```python
def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}
    @functools.wraps(cls, updated=[])
    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]
    return get_instance

@singleton
class Config:
    ...
```

Now `Config()` always returns the same instance. Class decorators are how `@dataclass` works: `@dataclass` reads the class's annotations and *generates* `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`. (Note `@dataclass` reads Python's *variable annotations* — `name: str` — which are Python's metadata feature; a neat case of a decorator consuming annotations.)

### 7. Stacking order

```python
@a
@b
@c
def f(): ...
```

is `f = a(b(c(f)))`. Applied **bottom-up** (`c` first), but at call time executes **top-down** (`a`'s wrapper outermost). So if `@timing` is on top of `@cache`, timing measures the cached call (fast on hits); swap them and timing measures the real call always. Order encodes semantics — choose it deliberately.

### 8. `functools.wraps` — what it actually copies, and why

Without it, the wrapper *is* a different object: `f.__name__ == "wrapper"`, `f.__doc__ is None`, `help(f)` is useless, and tools relying on `inspect.signature` see `(*args, **kwargs)`. `functools.wraps(func)` copies `__module__`, `__name__`, `__qualname__`, `__doc__`, `__dict__`, and sets `__wrapped__ = func` so introspection can recover the original. Treat it as non-optional on any function-wrapping decorator.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Real-world thing |
|---------|------------------|
| **`SOURCE` retention** | A pencil note on a blueprint that the builder reads, then erases before construction. Gone by move-in. |
| **`RUNTIME` retention** | A permanent engraved plaque the building staff can read forever while the building operates. |
| **Annotation processor (APT)** | A pre-construction inspector who reads the blueprint notes and *fabricates extra parts* before building starts. |
| **Runtime reflection** | A live audit team walking the finished building, reading plaques, and acting on them. |
| **`@Target`** | A rule on the sticky-note pad: "these notes may only go on doors, never on windows." |
| **Meta-annotation** | A note *on the note pad itself* describing how its notes behave. |
| **Decorator factory** | A vending machine for gift-wrappers: insert your choice (paper color), out comes the specific wrapper. |
| **Stacking** | Nesting boxes inside boxes; the last box you wrap is the first one a recipient opens. |
| **`functools.wraps`** | Re-printing the original product's barcode and label onto the outer box so scanners still recognize it. |

---

## Mental Models

### The Timeline Model

Place every `@`-feature on a single timeline: **source → compile → class-load/definition → steady-state runtime.**

- `SOURCE` annotations + APT act at **compile**.
- `RUNTIME` annotations act at **steady-state runtime** (and are *read* via reflection, often at class-load/startup).
- Python/TS decorators act at **definition** (module import / class load).

If you can mark *where on this line* a feature acts, you can predict its cost and its failure mode.

### The "Two Halves" Model (annotations)

An annotation is always **half a feature**. The other half is the reader: a processor (compile half) or reflection code (runtime half). When debugging "my annotation does nothing," you've almost always built only one half. Ask: *where is the code that looks for this annotation, and does the retention let it see it?*

### The "Peel the Onion" Model (decorators)

A stacked, factory-built decorator is layers of onion. To understand it, peel from the inside out by rewriting:

```python
@retry(3)
@log
def f(): ...
# f = retry(3)(log(f))
```

Evaluate `retry(3)` → decorator; `log(f)` → wrapped; then outer decorator wraps that. Mechanical rewriting beats intuition every time.

## Code Examples

### Java — defining a RUNTIME annotation with members and reading it

```java
import java.lang.annotation.*;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)     // so reflection can see it
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)             // only on methods
@interface Benchmark {
    int warmups() default 0;            // a member with a default
}

class Service {
    @Benchmark(warmups = 2)
    public void compute() { /* ... */ }
}

class Runner {
    static void run(Class<?> c) throws Exception {
        for (Method m : c.getDeclaredMethods()) {
            Benchmark b = m.getAnnotation(Benchmark.class);   // the reader
            if (b != null) {
                for (int i = 0; i < b.warmups(); i++) m.invoke(c.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance());
                // ... time the real run ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note both halves: the `@Benchmark` definition (with `RUNTIME` retention so it survives) and the `Runner` that reflects to find and act on it. Drop `RUNTIME` and `getAnnotation` returns `null`.

### Java — a SOURCE annotation consumed at compile time (sketch)

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@interface GenerateBuilder { }
```

A registered annotation processor would, during `javac`, see every `@GenerateBuilder` class and *emit* a `XxxBuilder.java` file. At runtime the annotation is gone — only the generated builder remains. (Full processor code is in `senior.md`.) This is the Dagger/AutoValue model: zero runtime reflection, all work done at build time.

### Python — parameterized decorator (factory) with a registry side effect

```python
import functools

ROUTES = {}

def route(path, methods=("GET",)):
    def decorator(func):
        ROUTES[path] = (func, methods)        # side effect at definition time
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@route("/users", methods=("GET", "POST"))
def users():
    return "user list"

# ROUTES now contains {"/users": (users, ("GET", "POST"))} — registered at import.
```

This is the skeleton of every micro-framework router (Flask, FastAPI). The factory captures `path` and `methods` in a closure, registers at import time, and returns the function.

### Python — class decorator that augments the class

```python
def add_repr(cls):
    def __repr__(self):
        fields = ", ".join(f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in self.__dict__.items())
        return f"{cls.__name__}({fields})"
    cls.__repr__ = __repr__       # mutate the class
    return cls

@add_repr
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y

print(Point(1, 2))   # Point(x=1, y=2)
```

The decorator receives the class, attaches a `__repr__`, and returns it. This is a miniature `@dataclass`.

### Python — stacking order made visible

```python
import functools

def tag(name):
    def deco(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*a, **k):
            print(f"enter {name}")
            r = func(*a, **k)
            print(f"exit {name}")
            return r
        return wrapper
    return deco

@tag("outer")
@tag("inner")
def work():
    print("working")

work()
# enter outer / enter inner / working / exit inner / exit outer
```

Applied bottom-up (`inner` wraps first), executed top-down (`outer` runs first). The print order proves it.

### TypeScript — a decorator factory storing config (Angular/NestJS pattern)

```typescript
function Controller(prefix: string) {
  return function (target: Function) {
    Reflect.defineMetadata?.('prefix', prefix, target);   // store metadata
  };
}

@Controller('/users')
class UsersController {}
```

`Controller('/users')` is the factory; it returns the actual decorator that stores `'/users'` as metadata on the class. NestJS later reads that metadata to build routes. Same decorator-doing-annotation's-job pattern, now with arguments. (The `Reflect.defineMetadata` mechanism is detailed in `senior.md`.)

### C# — attribute with constructor arguments, read by reflection

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method)]   // the C# equivalent of @Target
class RetryAttribute : Attribute
{
    public int Times { get; }
    public RetryAttribute(int times) => Times = times;
}

class Job
{
    [Retry(3)]
    public void Run() { }
}

// Reading it:
var attr = typeof(Job).GetMethod("Run")!
    .GetCustomAttribute<RetryAttribute>();
int times = attr?.Times ?? 1;
```

`[AttributeUsage]` is C#'s `@Target`; the attribute carries data via its constructor; reflection reads it. Conceptually identical to the Java `@Benchmark` example.

## Pros & Cons

| Aspect | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Compile-time processing (APT)** | Zero runtime cost; errors caught at build; generated code is debuggable. | Slower builds; processors are hard to write; generated code can confuse newcomers. |
| **Runtime reflection** | No build step; flexible; frameworks can adapt to any annotated code. | Startup scanning cost; reflection is slower than direct calls; errors surface late (at runtime). |
| **Decorator factories** | Configurable, reusable cross-cutting logic. | Easy to forget parentheses; three nesting levels are error-prone to read. |
| **Stacking** | Clean composition of concerns (auth + cache + log). | Order bugs are subtle and can be security-relevant (cache before auth). |
| **`functools.wraps`** | Preserves identity, docs, signature for tooling. | One more thing to forget; its absence fails silently until something introspects. |
| **Meta-annotations / retention** | Precise control over where and how long metadata lives. | Wrong retention = framework sees nothing, with no error. |

---

## Use Cases

- **DI containers** (Spring, Dagger, NestJS): `@Autowired`/`@Inject`/`@Injectable` — Dagger at compile time, Spring at runtime.
- **ORM mapping** (Hibernate/JPA, EF Core): `@Entity`, `@Column`, `[Key]` — read by reflection at startup.
- **Validation** (Bean Validation, FluentValidation): `@NotNull`, `[Range]` — read by a validator at runtime.
- **Routing** (Flask, FastAPI, Spring MVC, NestJS): factory decorators/annotations registering handlers.
- **Serialization** (Jackson, System.Text.Json): `@JsonProperty`, `[JsonPropertyName]` — read during (de)serialization.
- **Boilerplate elimination** (Lombok, AutoValue, MapStruct): compile-time generation from annotations.
- **Cross-cutting behavior** (Python): `@retry`, `@cache`, `@timed`, `@require_role` — runtime wrapping.

---

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: The factory-decorator-wrapper triple (Python)

```python
def deco_factory(config):
    def decorator(func):
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # use `config`
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

Memorize the three layers. The outer captures config; the middle is the real decorator; the inner forwards the call. Each layer has exactly one job.

### Pattern 2: Make a decorator work with *and* without arguments

```python
def smart(func=None, *, level=1):
    if func is None:                      # called as @smart(level=2)
        return functools.partial(smart, level=level)
    @functools.wraps(func)                # called as @smart
    def wrapper(*a, **k):
        return func(*a, **k)
    return wrapper
```

Both `@smart` and `@smart(level=2)` now work. This pattern handles the common "parentheses or not" ambiguity gracefully.

### Pattern 3: Annotation + reader as a pair (Java)

Always ship the annotation *and* its consumer together, and choose retention to match the consumer:

- Consumer is a build-time processor → `@Retention(SOURCE)`.
- Consumer is a runtime framework → `@Retention(RUNTIME)`.

Document which consumer reads it, right on the annotation's Javadoc.

### Pattern 4: Preserve the original for introspection

```python
@functools.wraps(func)
def wrapper(*a, **k): ...
# later, recover the unwrapped function:
original = wrapper.__wrapped__
```

`__wrapped__` lets debuggers, doc tools, and your own code reach the real function through the wrapper.

---

## Best Practices

- **Match retention to reader.** Runtime framework → `RUNTIME`. Compile-time processor → `SOURCE`. This is the #1 source of "my annotation is ignored" bugs.
- **Always set `@Target`.** Constrain where your annotation may go; let the compiler reject misuse.
- **Ship annotation and consumer as a unit.** A bare annotation is half a feature; document/test the reader alongside it.
- **Use `functools.wraps` on every wrapping decorator.** Non-negotiable for debuggable, introspectable code.
- **Support both bare and parameterized forms when ergonomics matter** (Pattern 2).
- **Be explicit about stacking order.** Comment *why* the order is what it is, especially for security-sensitive stacks (auth must be outermost over cache).
- **Prefer compile-time generation for hot paths.** If reflection scanning hurts startup or per-call latency, a code-gen approach (Dagger-style) removes it.
- **Keep decorators side-effect-aware.** Remember registration side effects fire at import; don't do expensive or order-dependent work there casually.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Wrong retention.** A custom `@RUNTIME`-needing annotation left at the default `CLASS` retention is invisible to reflection — and there's no error, just silence.
- **Decorator-factory parentheses.** `@retry` vs `@retry(3)`: using the factory without calling it passes the function as the *first positional arg of the factory*, producing baffling errors.
- **Forgetting `@wraps`.** Logs show `wrapper`, `help()` is empty, `inspect.signature` is wrong, and frameworks that key off `__name__` (some routers, some caches) misbehave.
- **Stacking order bugs.** `@cache` above `@auth` can serve cached responses without re-checking authorization — a real security hole.
- **Import-time side effects.** A decorator that registers routes/handlers runs when the module is imported; conditional or lazy imports can mean handlers never register.
- **Mutating the function vs returning a new one.** A decorator that returns a *new* object breaks identity comparisons and any reference captured before decoration.
- **`@Inherited` only covers class annotations, not method annotations,** and only along the superclass chain, not interfaces — a frequent surprise in framework code.
- **Repeatable annotations need a container.** Before `@Repeatable`, you couldn't apply the same annotation twice; mixing old code with repeatable usage causes confusing `getAnnotation` vs `getAnnotationsByType` differences.
- **Reflection cost.** Reading annotations per call (rather than caching the lookup) can dominate a hot loop — cache the reflective lookups.
- **Class decorator replacing the class** can break `isinstance` checks and pickling if it returns a function instead of a class (as the naive `@singleton` above does).
