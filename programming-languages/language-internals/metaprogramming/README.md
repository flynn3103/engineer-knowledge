# Metaprogramming Roadmap

> *"Code that writes code is the highest form of code reuse — and the easiest way to ship code nobody can debug."*

This roadmap is about **programs that manipulate programs**: reflection, macros, code generation, annotation processing, AST rewriting. Used well, metaprogramming eliminates entire categories of boilerplate. Used badly, it produces magic that no one — including the author six months later — can read.

> Looking for the *machinery underneath* (ASTs, parsers, IRs)? See [Compilers & Interpreters](../compilers-and-interpreters/README.md).
>
> Looking for *codegen at build time* (protobuf, gRPC, `go generate`)? Sections 04 and 05 below cover this directly.

## Why a Dedicated Roadmap

Every mainstream language has metaprogramming — but they disagree wildly on *when* and *how*:

- **Rust** does it at compile time with macros (`macro_rules!`, procedural macros, `syn` / `quote`)
- **Java** does it at compile time with annotation processors and at runtime with reflection
- **Python** does it at runtime with `__getattr__`, decorators, metaclasses, `inspect`
- **Go** has almost no metaprogramming — `go generate` and a bit of `reflect` — and the language designers consider that a feature

Understanding the spectrum makes you fluent across stacks and lets you judge "is this annotation magic actually buying us anything?"

| Roadmap | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| Design Patterns | What structures recur in OO code? |
| [Type Systems](../type-systems/README.md) | What can the compiler prove? |
| **Metaprogramming** (this) | When is it worth writing code that writes code? |

## Languages

The whole roadmap is a comparison: **Rust** (compile-time, type-checked macros), **Java** (annotation processing + reflection), **Python** (runtime, very dynamic), and **Go** (deliberately limited — `go generate` + `reflect`). Studying all four side-by-side makes the design trade-offs visible.

## Status

✅ **Content-complete — all 10 topics written across the six-file set (junior / middle / senior / professional / interview / tasks).**
