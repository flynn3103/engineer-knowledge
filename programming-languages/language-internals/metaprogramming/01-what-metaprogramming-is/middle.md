## Introduction

> Focus: **How do all the metaprogramming techniques fit together?** And **why do different languages place metaprogramming at wildly different points on a spectrum?**

At the junior level, metaprogramming was "code about code," organized by one axis: *when does the meta level run?* That axis is still the spine of everything here. Now we build the full **taxonomy** — a map you can drop any unfamiliar feature onto — and we look at *why* languages disagree so violently about how much metaprogramming to allow.

The disagreement is real and intentional. **Go** ships with essentially two metaprogramming features (`go generate` for build-time codegen and the `reflect` package for runtime introspection) and *deliberately no macros*, because its designers prized readability and tooling over expressive power. **Rust** pushes nearly all of its metaprogramming to *compile time* via a sophisticated macro system, so the costs are paid by the compiler, not by the running program. **Python** is the opposite extreme: almost everything is mutable and inspectable at runtime — classes are objects, you can rewrite methods on the fly, metaclasses control how classes are built, and `eval`/`exec` run strings as code. **Lisp** is a category of its own: code *is* data, so metaprogramming is not a bolted-on feature but the native idiom. **C++** does compile-time computation through templates and `constexpr`. **Java** splits the difference: annotation processors and reflection at runtime, with a strong type system underneath. **C** has only the textual preprocessor.

Understanding *why* a language made its choice — what it was optimizing for — is more valuable than memorizing each API. This page gives you the taxonomy and the spectrum so that the next time you read "this framework uses reflection" or "this crate is a proc-macro," you immediately know the stage, the cost, the failure mode, and roughly how to debug it.

> 🧭 **Why this matters at the middle level:** You are now reading and modifying frameworks, not just using them. You will encounter annotation processors, derive macros, reflection-heavy startup code, and generated stubs. The taxonomy turns "I don't know what this is" into "this is reflective, runtime, introspective — so it's slow but flexible, and I debug it by inspecting objects at startup."

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Comfort with the junior-level idea that metaprogramming is "code about code," split by *when the meta level runs*.
- **Required:** You've used at least one framework that "does magic" (a web framework, an ORM, a test runner, a serializer).
- **Required:** A rough mental model of the build pipeline: source → parse → (type-check / compile) → executable → run.
- **Helpful:** You've written a Python decorator, a Java annotation, or used `#[derive]` in Rust.
- **Helpful:** You know what an AST (abstract syntax tree) is, even loosely.

You do **not** need:

- To implement a macro system or a reflection runtime — those are later topics.
- Type theory or compiler internals beyond "there's a parsing/compiling phase before running."

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Meta level / object level** | The code doing the operating (meta) vs. the code being operated on (object/base). |
| **Stage** | The phase at which meta-code runs: read-time, compile-time, link-time, load-time, or runtime. |
| **Multi-stage programming** | Explicitly structuring a program so some computation runs at an earlier stage to produce code for a later stage. |
| **Reflection** | Runtime introspection (and sometimes intercession) of a program's own structure. |
| **Macro** | A compile-time construct expanded into other code. *Textual* (C preprocessor) or *syntactic/hygienic* (Lisp, Rust). |
| **Annotation processor (APT)** | A build-time plugin (Java) that reads annotations and generates code or checks. |
| **Metaclass** | The class of a class; controls class creation (Python `type`, Ruby singleton classes). |
| **Dynamic proxy** | A runtime-generated stand-in object that intercepts method calls. |
| **Template metaprogramming (TMP)** | C++ technique of computing with types and values at compile time via templates. |
| **`constexpr` / `comptime`** | Language features (C++ `constexpr`, Zig `comptime`) that run ordinary-looking code at compile time. |
| **Quoting / quasiquotation** | Treating code as a data value; quasiquotation lets you splice computed pieces into quoted code. |
| **Hygiene** | A macro property guaranteeing introduced names can't accidentally capture or be captured by the user's names. |
| **Homoiconicity** | Code and data share one representation (Lisp). |
| **Monkeypatching** | Replacing or adding methods/functions on existing types at runtime. |
| **Generated code** | Source emitted by a tool; usually marked "DO NOT EDIT" and regenerable. |
| **Introspection / intercession** | Observe vs. modify the program's structure at runtime. |

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Full Taxonomy of Techniques

Every metaprogramming feature you'll meet is one of these. The grouping is by *what it does*; the stage (when it runs) is noted because that's the dominant property.

| Technique | What it does | Typical stage | Generative/Reflective |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| **Reflection / introspection** | Inspect types, fields, methods at runtime | Runtime | Reflective |
| **Intercession** | Modify structure/behavior at runtime | Runtime | Reflective |
| **Annotations / attributes** | Attach machine-readable data to code | Read by build *or* runtime tools | (data; enabler) |
| **Decorators** | Wrap/replace functions or classes | Runtime (Python: at import) | Reflective + generative |
| **Code generation** | Emit source from a schema/spec | Build-time | Generative |
| **Macros (textual)** | Token substitution before compile | Pre-compile (C preprocessor) | Generative |
| **Macros (syntactic/hygienic)** | Transform the AST before compile | Compile-time (Lisp, Rust) | Generative |
| **Metaclasses** | Control how classes are constructed | Runtime (class-creation time) | Reflective + generative |
| **Dynamic proxies** | Runtime stand-ins intercepting calls | Runtime | Generative + reflective |
| **`eval` / `exec`** | Run a string as code | Runtime | Generative |
| **Template metaprogramming** | Compute with types/values | Compile-time (C++) | Generative |
| **`constexpr` / `comptime`** | Run normal code at compile time | Compile-time (C++, Zig) | Generative |
| **AST manipulation** | Walk/rewrite the syntax tree | Build-time *or* runtime | Both |

Notice that **annotations are not a technique by themselves** — they are *data attached to code*, made meaningful only by something that reads them (an annotation processor at build time, or reflection at runtime). This is a common source of confusion: the `@Annotation` is inert; the reader gives it power.

### 2. Stages Are Finer Than "Compile vs Run"

Junior level used two stages. In reality there is a chain, and metaprogramming can hook into any link:

```text
 read-time  →  macro-expand  →  type-check  →  compile  →  link  →  load  →  runtime
   (C pp)       (Lisp/Rust)      (C++ TMP)                          (class    (reflection,
                                                                    loaders)   eval, proxies)
```

The earlier a stage, the cheaper (at runtime) and the safer (errors caught sooner), but the less it knows about the actual world the program will run in. The later a stage, the more it knows (real data, real config, loaded plugins) but the more it costs and the later it fails. This is the **earliness/knowledge trade-off**, and it underlies every design decision in the field.

### 3. The Language Spectrum

Languages can be placed on a line from "metaprogramming is forbidden/minimal" to "metaprogramming is the language."

```text
 minimal ◄───────────────────────────────────────────────────► maximal
   Go        C        Java        C++        Rust      Python       Lisp
   │         │         │           │          │          │          │
 reflect   text     reflection   templates  hygienic   runtime    code IS
 + go      pre-      + annotation + constexpr macros    everything  data;
 generate  processor processors   (compile-  (compile-  (classes,   macros are
 (no       (no AST,  + dynamic    time TMP)  time)      metaclasses, native
 macros    just      proxies      static     mostly     monkey-
 by        tokens)   (runtime,    typing     compile-   patch,
 design)             dynamic)                time       eval)
```

The crucial observation: **position on this line is a design choice, not an accident.** Each language traded something:

- **Go** chose *readability and tooling* over expressive power. No macros means "what you read is what runs" — a non-trivial productivity and onboarding benefit at scale. It accepts more boilerplate in exchange.
- **Rust** chose *zero-cost abstraction*: do the metaprogramming at compile time so the running binary pays nothing, and keep it hygienic and type-checked so it stays safe.
- **Python** chose *maximal runtime flexibility*: everything is an object you can inspect and mutate, enabling extraordinarily expressive frameworks (Django, SQLAlchemy) at the cost of speed and "spooky action."
- **C++** chose *compile-time computation through the type system*, which is enormously powerful but historically produced famously inscrutable errors.
- **Lisp** chose *homoiconicity*, making metaprogramming the native idiom rather than a feature.
- **Java** chose a *middle path*: strong static types, reflection and dynamic proxies at runtime, annotation processing at build time — enough power for Spring and Hibernate, with guardrails.
- **C** chose *only a textual preprocessor* — the bluntest, least safe form (no understanding of types or scope), kept for simplicity and portability.

### 4. Quoting and Quasiquotation

To manipulate code as data, you need a way to say "don't run this — treat it as a value." That's **quoting**. In Lisp, `'(+ 1 2)` is the *list* `(+ 1 2)`, not the number `3`. **Quasiquotation** adds holes you can fill with computed pieces: in Lisp, ``` `(+ 1 ,x) ``` is "the code `(+ 1 ...)` with the value of `x` spliced in." Rust's `quote!` macro and template literals in some languages serve the same role. Quoting is the bridge between "code" and "data you can build and transform"; every macro system has some form of it.

### 5. Introspection vs Intercession, Sharpened

- **Introspection** is *almost always safe*: reading type names, field lists, annotations. Serializers, DI containers (at scan time), test runners, and debuggers rely on it.
- **Intercession** is *powerful and risky*: adding methods to a live class (monkeypatching), swapping a function, generating a proxy that wraps every call. It breaks the assumption that code is fixed once written, which is exactly what makes it both useful (AOP, mocking) and dangerous (action-at-a-distance bugs).

A practical rule: introspection scales to large teams; intercession needs strict discipline and clear ownership, because it can change behavior anywhere.

### 6. Multi-Stage Programming, Introduced

**Multi-stage programming (MSP)** is the explicit, principled version of "do work earlier to make later work fast." You annotate which computations happen at an earlier stage to *generate* the code that runs at a later stage. C++ template metaprogramming, Rust's `const fn` and macros, Zig's `comptime`, and research languages like MetaML/MetaOCaml are points on this continuum. The mental model: a *staged* program is one where some of the program's job is "write the rest of the program." You'll see this idea formalized in the compile-time-vs-runtime trade-offs topic of this section; here, just hold the concept that staging is metaprogramming with the *stages made explicit and type-checked*.

### 7. Self-Modifying Code: Mostly History

Classic **self-modifying code** literally rewrote its own machine instructions in memory — to save space, to patch jumps, to implement early JITs. On modern hardware this is hostile to instruction caches, branch predictors, and security hardening (`W^X`: memory is writable *or* executable, not both). Today, "self-modifying" in practice means *runtime metaprogramming* (a program reshaping its own objects/classes), and genuine instruction rewriting is confined to JIT compilers and a few specialized runtimes that take great care. Know the term and its history; don't reach for the literal version.

## Real-World Analogies

| Concept | Real-world thing |
|---------|------------------|
| **The taxonomy** | A field guide: birds (runtime/reflective), reptiles (compile-time/generative) — same kingdom, different families. |
| **Stages** | A construction project: blueprints (compile-time) vs. on-site decisions when the truck arrives (runtime). Earlier decisions are cheaper to make but know less. |
| **The language spectrum** | Cars on a dial from "automatic, no clutch, can't stall" (Go) to "manual race car, total control, easy to wreck" (Lisp/Python). |
| **Quoting** | Putting a sentence in quotation marks: you're *mentioning* the words, not *using* them. |
| **Quasiquotation** | A mostly-fixed template with `____` blanks you fill in. |
| **Introspection** | Reading the spec sheet of a machine. |
| **Intercession** | Opening the machine and swapping parts while it runs. |
| **Multi-stage programming** | A factory that first builds a custom jig, then uses the jig to stamp parts fast. |
| **Go's restraint** | A kitchen that bans clever shortcuts so any cook can read any recipe. |
| **Python's openness** | A kitchen where you can redefine "boil" mid-service — fast for experts, chaos for newcomers. |

## Mental Models

### The "Drop It on the Map" Model

Keep two axes in your head and you can place any feature:

```text
                  GENERATIVE (makes code)
                          ▲
         macros, codegen, │  proxies (gen at runtime),
         templates,       │  derive at runtime
         #[derive]        │
   COMPILE ◄──────────────┼──────────────► RUNTIME
         constexpr,       │  reflection,
         APT              │  metaclasses,
                          │  monkeypatching, eval
                          ▼
                  REFLECTIVE (inspects/alters existing)
```

A derive macro sits top-left (generative, compile-time). Reflection sits bottom-right (reflective, runtime). Dynamic proxies sit top-right (generate a stand-in, at runtime). Once placed, the feature's cost and risk are predictable.

### The "Earliness Dial" Model

Imagine a dial from "do it as early as possible" to "do it as late as possible." Turning it earlier buys speed and safety but blinds you to runtime reality. Turning it later buys adaptability but costs performance and moves failures into production. Every language picked a default position on this dial, and every individual feature in your codebase sits somewhere on it. Designing well = choosing the *earliest* stage that still has the information you need.

### The "Who Reads the Label?" Model

Annotations are labels; they do nothing alone. For any `@Annotation`, find *the reader*: an annotation processor (build-time), a reflection scan at startup (runtime), or a proxy factory. The annotation tells you *what is meant*; the reader tells you *when and how it acts*. Confusing the label with the behavior is the most common middle-level mistake.

### The "Language's Bargain" Model

Whenever a language's metaprogramming surprises you, ask *what was it optimizing for?* Go's lack of macros is not an oversight — it bought predictable, greppable, tool-friendly code. Python's mutability is not sloppiness — it bought framework expressiveness. Reading a language's metaprogramming choices as deliberate bargains makes them learnable instead of arbitrary.

---

## Code Examples

Each example highlights *stage* and *taxonomy slot*. Run them and locate each on the map.

### Java — Annotation Processor vs Runtime Reflection (same annotation, two stages)

```java
// The SAME annotation can be consumed at DIFFERENT stages.
import java.lang.annotation.*;

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.SOURCE)   // visible only to the COMPILER / APT
@interface GenerateBuilder {}

@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)  // survives into the running program
@interface Endpoint { String path(); }
```

`RetentionPolicy.SOURCE` means an **annotation processor** (build-time) reads it and generates code; it's gone by runtime. `RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME` means **reflection** (runtime) reads it. The *retention policy is literally a declaration of which stage will consume this label.* This single example captures the whole "when does the meta level run?" axis.

### Rust — Compile-Time `const fn` (computation moved to build)

```rust
const fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
    let mut acc = 1;
    let mut i = 2;
    while i <= n {
        acc *= i;
        i += 1;
    }
    acc
}

const TABLE_SIZE: u64 = factorial(5);   // computed AT COMPILE TIME → 120

fn main() {
    let buf = [0u8; TABLE_SIZE as usize]; // size known before the program runs
    println!("{}", buf.len());            // 120, zero runtime computation
}
```

This is multi-stage programming in miniature: ordinary-looking code runs at compile time to produce a constant the runtime simply uses. Rust pushes work to the build stage to make the binary pay nothing.

### Python — Metaclass (intercession at class-creation time)

```python
class AutoRepr(type):                 # a metaclass: the "class of a class"
    def __new__(mcs, name, bases, ns):
        cls = super().__new__(mcs, name, bases, ns)
        def __repr__(self):
            fields = ", ".join(f"{k}={v!r}" for k, v in vars(self).items())
            return f"{name}({fields})"
        cls.__repr__ = __repr__       # INJECT a method into the class
        return cls

class Point(metaclass=AutoRepr):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y

print(Point(1, 2))   # Point(x=1, y=2)  -- __repr__ was generated for us
```

The metaclass runs *when the `Point` class is created* (a distinct runtime stage) and *injects* a method — this is **intercession**, top-right of our map. Django's models and SQLAlchemy's declarative base work on exactly this mechanism.

### Java — Dynamic Proxy (generate a stand-in at runtime)

```java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

interface Service { String run(String in); }

public class ProxyDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Service real = in -> "result:" + in;
        Service proxied = (Service) Proxy.newProxyInstance(
            Service.class.getClassLoader(),
            new Class<?>[]{Service.class},
            (proxy, method, mArgs) -> {          // intercepts EVERY call
                System.out.println("calling " + method.getName());
                return method.invoke(real, mArgs);
            });
        System.out.println(proxied.run("x"));
        // calling run
        // result:x
    }
}
```

`Proxy.newProxyInstance` *generates a class at runtime* that implements `Service` and routes every call through your handler. This is how Spring adds transactions/logging "around" your beans without you writing wrapper code — generative *and* runtime (top-right).

### Go — `reflect` for Generic Struct Inspection (runtime introspection)

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

type User struct {
    Name string `json:"name"`
    Age  int    `json:"age"`
}

func describe(v any) {
    t := reflect.TypeOf(v)
    for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
        f := t.Field(i)
        fmt.Printf("%s (%s) tag=%q\n", f.Name, f.Type, f.Tag.Get("json"))
    }
}

func main() {
    describe(User{})
    // Name (string) tag="name"
    // Age (int) tag="age"
}
```

Go intentionally gives you *introspection* (`reflect`) but *no macros* — so when you need to generate code rather than inspect at runtime, the idiomatic answer is `go generate` writing a real `.go` file you can read. The language nudges you toward visible, debuggable generation.

### Lisp — Quasiquotation (build code from a template)

```lisp
;; `swap!` writes code that swaps two place values, using quasiquote/unquote.
(defmacro swap! (a b)
  `(let ((tmp ,a))     ; backquote = template; comma = splice in the argument
     (setf ,a ,b)
     (setf ,b tmp)))

;; (swap! x y) expands BEFORE running into:
;;   (let ((tmp x)) (setf x y) (setf y tmp))
```

The backquote builds a code *template*; the commas splice in the actual arguments. This is quasiquotation, the core mechanism of nearly every macro system — Rust's `quote!` is the same idea with different syntax.

## Pros & Cons

| Aspect | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Build-time techniques** (macros, codegen, templates, APT) | Zero runtime cost; errors caught early; output is real, shippable code. | Slower builds; opaque compiler errors pointing at generated code; can balloon compile times (C++ TMP). |
| **Runtime techniques** (reflection, metaclasses, proxies, eval) | Adapt to real data/config/plugins; enable extremely flexible frameworks. | Slow per-call; failures hit production; defeat IDE navigation. |
| **Generative** | Removes boilerplate wholesale. | Generated code is still code you ship and must understand. |
| **Reflective** | Write-once logic that works across many types. | Loses static guarantees; type errors surface at runtime. |
| **Minimal-MP languages** (Go) | Predictable, greppable, tool-friendly; easy onboarding. | More boilerplate; some patterns are verbose. |
| **Maximal-MP languages** (Python, Lisp) | Spectacular expressiveness and DSLs. | "Spooky action," steep ramp for newcomers, harder static analysis. |

---

## Use Cases

Classify the job, then pick the stage:

- **Schema → glue code** (gRPC, ORM, OpenAPI): build-time **code generation**. Visible, debuggable, zero runtime cost.
- **"Do X to every type" without writing per-type code** (serialize, compare, hash): **derive macros** (Rust), **annotation processors** (Java), or runtime **reflection** (Go, Python) depending on the language's bargain.
- **Cross-cutting concerns** (logging, transactions, auth, caching) applied uniformly: **annotations + dynamic proxies** (Java/Spring) or **decorators** (Python).
- **Framework that adapts to user-defined types at runtime** (DI containers, test runners, validators): runtime **reflection / introspection**.
- **Domain-specific languages** embedded in the host language: **macros** (Lisp, Rust) or runtime object tricks (Python).
- **Performance-critical compile-time computation** (lookup tables, dimension-checked math): **templates / `constexpr` / `comptime`**.

Avoid metaprogramming when explicit code is read more than written and a function or generated-but-checked-in file would be clearer.

## Coding Patterns

### Pattern 1: Place every feature on the 2×2 map

For any magic: *generative or reflective?* × *compile-time or runtime?* That single placement predicts speed, failure mode, and debug strategy. Make it a reflex.

### Pattern 2: Match the stage to the information you have

If everything you need is known at build time, generate at build time. Only push to runtime the parts that genuinely depend on runtime-only information (loaded plugins, config, actual data shapes).

### Pattern 3: Annotations + a named reader

When designing your own annotation-driven feature, make the reader explicit and discoverable: a documented annotation processor, or a documented startup scan. Don't bury the reader so deep that nobody can find why `@Foo` "works."

### Pattern 4: Prefer hygienic/syntactic macros over textual ones

If your language offers AST-level (hygienic) macros, prefer them to textual substitution. Textual macros (C preprocessor) don't understand scope or types and produce subtle capture bugs; syntactic macros (Lisp, Rust) respect both.

### Pattern 5: Keep introspection at the boundary, not in hot loops

Reflection at startup/config time is fine. Reflection on every request is a performance bug. Cache reflective lookups (resolved methods, field accessors) once, reuse the cheap handle.

---

## Best Practices

- **Name the stage out loud in design docs and code comments.** "This is a build-time codegen step" vs "this is a runtime reflection scan" changes everything about how it's reviewed and debugged.
- **Use the language's blessed mechanism, not a workaround.** A proc-macro in Rust, an annotation processor in Java, `go generate` in Go — these have tooling support; ad-hoc string munging does not.
- **Make generated code first-class.** Check it in (or make regeneration trivial and CI-verified), mark it "DO NOT EDIT," and ensure stack traces can point into it meaningfully.
- **Respect the language's bargain.** Don't fight Go by simulating macros with codegen hacks where a plain function would do; don't fight Python by avoiding all runtime flexibility when it's the idiomatic solution.
- **Cache runtime reflection.** Resolve once at startup; never repeat per-call.
- **Treat intercession (monkeypatching, runtime method injection) as load-bearing and document it.** It changes behavior at a distance; the next reader cannot see it without help.
- **Prefer the earliest viable stage.** Earlier = faster and safer. Move later only for information that doesn't exist yet.

---

## Edge Cases & Pitfalls

- **Confusing the annotation with its reader.** `@Cacheable` does nothing unless a proxy/processor reads it. Many "my annotation is ignored" bugs are a missing or misconfigured reader.
- **Wrong retention/stage.** A Java annotation with `SOURCE` retention is invisible to runtime reflection; one with `RUNTIME` is invisible to nothing and bloats class metadata. Choosing the wrong stage silently breaks the feature.
- **Textual macro capture (C).** `#define SQ(x) x*x` then `SQ(a+b)` becomes `a+b*a+b`. Textual macros don't understand expressions. Use parentheses, or better, a real function/inline.
- **Compile-time blowup.** C++ template metaprogramming and heavy const evaluation can explode compile times and error messages. Bound the recursion; prefer `constexpr`/concepts to raw TMP where possible.
- **Reflection breaks under optimization.** Tree-shaking, dead-code elimination, R8/ProGuard, and Go's linker can strip "unused" code that reflection reaches by name at runtime — leading to "works in dev, crashes in prod." Reflection often needs keep-rules.
- **Proxies and `this`/`self` identity.** A dynamic proxy is *not* the original object; identity comparisons, `final` methods, and self-invocation (a method calling another method on the same object) may bypass the proxy. Spring's "self-invocation doesn't trigger the proxy" is a classic.
- **Order of stages matters.** Generated code that another generator depends on must be produced first. Build-time metaprogramming has *dependencies between generators* that, if unordered, produce flaky builds.
- **`eval`/`exec` as a "quick fix."** It's a security hole and a tooling blind spot. Almost any use on dynamic input is a bug.
- **Assuming Python's mutability everywhere.** Not every object allows monkeypatching (C-extension types, `__slots__`, frozen dataclasses). Intercession isn't universal even in flexible languages.

## Summary

- The whole field reduces to a **taxonomy** placeable on two axes: **stage** (compile/build-time → runtime) and **kind** (generative → reflective). Drop any feature on that map and its cost, risk, and debug strategy follow.
- **Annotations are data, not behavior.** Power comes from the *reader* — an annotation processor (build) or a reflection scan (runtime). The retention/stage of an annotation declares which.
- Stages are finer than "compile vs run": read-time → macro-expand → type-check → compile → link → load → runtime. Metaprogramming can hook any link, governed by the **earliness/knowledge trade-off**.
- The **language spectrum** — Go (deliberately minimal: `reflect` + `go generate`, no macros), C (textual preprocessor), Java (reflection + APT + proxies), C++ (templates + `constexpr`), Rust (compile-time hygienic macros), Python (maximal runtime flexibility), Lisp (code is data) — reflects deliberate bargains, not accidents. Read each as "what was it optimizing for?"
- **Quoting/quasiquotation** is the bridge from code to manipulable data; every macro system has it.
- **Introspection** (observe) scales; **intercession** (modify at runtime) is powerful but needs discipline.
- **Multi-stage programming** is the explicit, type-checked version of "do work earlier to make later work fast"; **self-modifying code** in the literal instruction-rewriting sense is mostly history, confined to JITs.
- Design rule: **choose the earliest stage that still has the information you need.** It's the cheapest and safest place to do the work.

### The 2×2 Map

```text
              GENERATIVE (produces code)
                       ▲

### The Stage Chain

```text
 read-time → macro-expand → type-check → compile → link → load → runtime
   C pp         Lisp/Rust      C++ TMP                      class    reflection
                macros         constexpr                    loaders  eval, proxies,
                                                                     metaclasses
 ◄── earlier: cheaper at runtime, safer, knows LESS about the real world
     later: costs runtime, fails in prod, knows MORE (real data/config) ──►
```

### The Language Spectrum

### Annotation → Reader (two possible readers)

```text
            @Annotation on your code
                   │
        ┌──────────┴───────────┐
        ▼                      ▼
  build-time reader       runtime reader
  (annotation processor)  (reflection scan)
        │                      │
        ▼                      ▼
   generates code          acts at startup
   (gone by runtime)       / per call
```

### Stage vs Knowledge Trade-off

```text
  EARLY stage                              LATE stage
  ───────────                              ──────────
  + zero runtime cost                      + adapts to real data/config/plugins
  + errors caught before ship              − pays cost on every call
  − blind to runtime reality               − fails in production
        │                                        │
        └─────── choose the EARLIEST stage ──────┘
                 that still has the info you need
