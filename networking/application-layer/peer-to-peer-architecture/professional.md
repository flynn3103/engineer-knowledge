## 1. From Client-Server to Structured Overlays

A client-server system places authority at a known address. A P2P system distributes both **data** and **routing authority** across symmetric participants, none of which holds a global view. The engineering problem this creates is *lookup*: given a key `k`, which peer(s) currently hold or are responsible for it, and how do I reach one of them without a directory?

Three overlay families answer this differently:

- **Unstructured** (early Gnutella): no placement rule; queries flood or random-walk. Cheap to join, resilient to churn, but lookup is `O(n)` in the worst case and rare items may never be found. Termination is probabilistic (TTL-bounded).
- **Structured (DHT)** (Chord, Kademlia, Pastry): keys and nodes share one identifier space; a deterministic rule maps each key to a responsible node, and a routing table lets any node forward toward that node in `O(log n)` hops. Guaranteed lookup, at the cost of maintenance under churn.
- **Hybrid / tracker-assisted** (classic BitTorrent): a centralized or DHT-based tracker bootstraps peer discovery; the actual data transfer is fully peer-to-peer.

The professional pivot is understanding that a DHT converts an unbounded search into a **greedy walk that strictly reduces a distance metric** at every hop. Everything below is a study of that metric and the data structures that make the walk cheap.

## 2. The Distributed Hash Table Abstraction

A DHT exposes a hash-table interface — `put(key, value)`, `get(key) -> value` — partitioned across a dynamic set of nodes. Both nodes and keys are hashed into the same `m`-bit identifier space (typically `m = 160`, i.e. SHA-1 output, or 256 bits). This shared space is the crux: **a key and a node ID are comparable**, so "which node owns key `k`" is answered by a distance rule over IDs.

Two properties are wanted from the placement rule:

- **Load balance.** With a good hash, each of `n` nodes owns `~K/n` of the `K` keys, and the largest share is `O((K/n) log n)` with high probability. This is exactly the [consistent-hashing](#consistent-hashing-vs-dht-keyspace) result.
- **Minimal disruption on membership change.** When a node joins or leaves, only `O(K/n)` keys must migrate — the keys adjacent to the departing/arriving node in the metric — not the whole table.

### Consistent hashing vs DHT keyspace

Consistent hashing and a DHT keyspace are the *same idea viewed from two altitudes*:

- **Consistent hashing** is the *placement* layer. It answers "who owns key `k`?" by hashing `k` onto a ring (or metric space) and assigning it to the nearest node clockwise (Chord) or by XOR-closeness (Kademlia). Virtual nodes smooth the variance so no node owns a disproportionate arc.
- **The DHT** adds a *routing* layer on top: each node keeps a sparse, distance-stratified routing table so it can *find* the owner in `O(log n)` hops without knowing all `n` nodes. Plain consistent hashing (as used inside a single Dynamo-style cluster) needs no routing overlay because every node knows the full ring; a DHT is what you build when `n` is too large or too dynamic for anyone to hold the full membership.

So: consistent hashing solves *ownership*; the DHT overlay solves *reachability* when membership itself must be discovered hop by hop.

## 3. Kademlia: The XOR Metric

Kademlia (Maymounkov & Mazières, *"Kademlia: A Peer-to-peer Information System Based on the XOR Metric"*, 2002) defines the distance between two `m`-bit identifiers `x` and `y` as their bitwise exclusive-or interpreted as an integer:

```
d(x, y) = x ⊕ y
```

This looks trivial but is a genuine **metric** and that is the whole point. It satisfies:

- **Identity:** `d(x, x) = 0`, and `d(x, y) = 0 ⟹ x = y`.
- **Symmetry:** `d(x, y) = d(y, x)` — because `⊕` is commutative. (This is Kademlia's key advantage over Chord, whose clockwise distance is *asymmetric*: `d(a→b) ≠ d(b→a)`. Symmetry means the node A learns about while querying is also a node for whom A is a useful contact, so routing tables self-populate from ordinary traffic.)
- **Triangle inequality:** `d(x, z) ≤ d(x, y) ⊕ d(y, z)`, which follows from `x ⊕ z = (x ⊕ y) ⊕ (y ⊕ z)` and the fact that `a ⊕ b ≤ a + b` bitwise.
- **Unidirectionality:** for any `x` and any distance `Δ`, there is exactly *one* `y` with `d(x, y) = Δ`. This guarantees that lookups for the same key **converge along the same path** regardless of the origin, so caching along that path is effective.

### Why XOR gives a tree

Interpret each ID as a leaf of a binary trie of depth `m`. The XOR distance between two leaves is governed by the height of their lowest common ancestor: the **length of the shared prefix** determines the most-significant differing bit, and that bit dominates the distance. Two IDs sharing a long prefix are close; sharing no prefix are maximally far. A Kademlia node's obligation is simply to know *some* peers in each subtree that does **not** contain itself — one subtree per bit position — which is exactly `O(log n)` subtrees, hence `O(log n)` routing state.

---

## 4. k-Buckets and Routing-Table Geometry

Each node partitions the other `n-1` possible IDs by XOR distance into `m` buckets. **Bucket `i`** holds contacts whose distance from this node lies in the range `[2^i, 2^{i+1})` — equivalently, contacts that share exactly `m - i - 1` leading bits with us and differ at bit `i`. Bucket `i` therefore covers a subtree of the ID trie of size `2^i`.

Because IDs are uniformly hashed, the number of live nodes actually falling in bucket `i` shrinks geometrically as `i` decreases (closer buckets cover exponentially smaller ID ranges). Kademlia caps each bucket at **`k` contacts** (typically `k = 20`) — enough that with high probability at least one of any `k` peers survives a bootstrap interval, giving redundancy against churn.

### The LRU-with-liveness eviction rule

A k-bucket is an **LRU list biased toward long-lived nodes**. On seeing a message from a known contact, move it to the tail (most-recently-seen). On seeing a *new* contact:

1. If the bucket has `< k` entries, append it.
2. If the bucket is full, PING the *least-recently-seen* (head) contact. If it responds, keep it and **discard the newcomer**; if it fails to respond, evict it and admit the newcomer.

This encodes a measured observation about churn: **the longer a node has been up, the longer it is likely to stay up** (uptime distributions are heavy-tailed / roughly Pareto). Preferring incumbents makes routing tables resistant to churn *and* raises the cost of flooding the table with fresh malicious identities — a first line of Sybil defense (see §10).

The whole routing table is thus `O(m)` buckets × `k` contacts = `O(log n · k)` = `O(log n)` state, with the closest subtrees kept densely and the far subtrees sampled sparsely.

---

## 5. Iterative FIND_NODE and O(log n) Convergence

Kademlia's four RPCs are `PING`, `STORE`, `FIND_NODE`, and `FIND_VALUE`. Lookup is built on `FIND_NODE(target)`, which asks a peer to return the `k` contacts it knows closest (by XOR) to `target`.

Kademlia does **iterative** (not recursive) routing: the *initiator* drives the whole lookup, so it observes progress at every step and controls parallelism. The algorithm:

1. Pick the `α` (parallelism, typically 3) contacts closest to `target` from the initiator's own buckets. Maintain a shortlist sorted by XOR distance to `target`.
2. Send `FIND_NODE(target)` to those `α` peers in parallel.
3. Merge every returned contact into the shortlist. Each response is expected to contain peers **strictly closer** to `target` than the responder (because each responder halves the remaining distance on average).
4. From the (updated) shortlist, query the closest `α` **not-yet-queried** peers.
5. Terminate when a full round returns no node closer than the best already seen — the `k` closest live nodes to `target` have converged.

Each hop resolves at least one more bit of the shared prefix with `target`, so the number of unresolved bits — and thus the expected hop count — is `O(log n)`. The `α` parallelism trades a modest bandwidth increase for lower tail latency and robustness to a few dead contacts stalling the walk.

    participant A as Peer A (d=1011)
    participant B as Peer B (d=0110)

    participant T as Owner ≈ target (d=0000)
    Note over I: Target key K; shortlist seeded α=2 nearest known
    I->>A: FIND_NODE(K)   [dist 1011]
    I->>B: FIND_NODE(K)   [dist 0110]
    A-->>I: k closest it knows → includes C (0011)
    B-->>I: k closest it knows → includes C (0011)
    Note over I: Best distance improved 0110 → 0011 (a bit resolved)
    I->>C: FIND_NODE(K)   [dist 0011]
    C-->>I: k closest → includes owner T (0000)
    I->>T: FIND_NODE(K) / FIND_VALUE(K)
    T-->>I: value or self as owner
    Note over I,T: No closer node returned → converged in O(log n) rounds
```

`FIND_VALUE` short-circuits: if any queried peer holds the value it returns it immediately instead of contacts, and the initiator then **caches** the value at the closest peer that *didn't* have it — a self-tuning cache that hugs popular keys near their owners.

## 6. Chord vs Kademlia vs Pastry

All three are `O(log n)` DHTs; they differ in metric geometry, routing-table structure, and how gracefully they tolerate churn.

| Dimension | **Chord** | **Kademlia** | **Pastry** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metric | Clockwise numeric distance on a ring (asymmetric) | XOR (symmetric, unidirectional) | Numeric prefix + ring proximity |
| Routing state | Finger table: `O(log n)` fingers + successor list | `O(log n)` k-buckets × `k` | Leaf set + routing table + neighborhood set, `O(log n)` |
| Lookup cost | `O(log n)` hops | `O(log n)` hops | `O(log₂ᵇ n)` hops (base `2^b`) |
| Routing style | Recursive or iterative; greedy toward successor | Iterative, `α`-parallel | Recursive, prefix-matching |
| Table repair | Periodic `stabilize` + fix-fingers | Passive: learns from every RPC it receives | Active leaf-set / neighborhood repair |
| Symmetry | No — inbound ≠ outbound routes | Yes — path-independent, cacheable | Partial |
| Locality awareness | None (pure ID space) | None inherently | Yes — neighborhood set uses network proximity |
| Churn resilience | Weaker; incorrect fingers cause lookup failures until stabilize | Strong; `k`-redundant buckets + parallel `α` | Moderate; needs active repair |

**Reading the table.** Chord is the cleanest to prove and teach — one ring, one successor rule, finger `i` points halfway-plus around the ring — but its asymmetry means it can't learn routing entries from incoming queries and it depends on a background `stabilize` protocol to stay correct under churn. Pastry adds *network locality* (its neighborhood set prefers physically nearby peers), reducing real latency, at the cost of a more complex three-structure table and active repair. Kademlia wins in production (Ethereum's discv5, IPFS, BitTorrent's Mainline DHT) precisely because **symmetry makes maintenance nearly free**: every message a node receives carries a candidate contact for a bucket, so tables self-heal from ordinary traffic without a dedicated stabilization round.

## 7. Gossip and Epidemic Dissemination

DHT routing solves *point* lookup. Broadcasting an update to *all* peers — membership changes, block announcements, CRDT deltas — is the domain of **gossip (epidemic) protocols**, which trade determinism for extreme robustness. The model is borrowed directly from mathematical epidemiology (SIR: Susceptible / Infected / Removed).

Each round, every "infected" node contacts a small constant number of random peers and shares the update. Three interaction modes:

| Mode | Mechanism | Rounds to full coverage | Message cost | Best when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Push** | Infected nodes send to random peers | `O(log n)` but slow *tail* — last few nodes hard to hit | High late-stage waste (most targets already infected) | Update is fresh, few sources |
| **Pull** | Every node asks a random peer "anything new?" | Fast *once* a constant fraction is infected; slow start | High early-stage waste (nothing to pull yet) | Update is already widespread |
| **Push-pull** | Both directions per contact | `O(log n)` with best constants; **doubly-exponential** tail collapse | Lowest total, converges fastest | General case — the default |

### The dissemination bound

With push, if `S_r` nodes are still susceptible after round `r`, the infection roughly **doubles** each round while susceptibles are plentiful (`I_{r+1} ≈ 2·I_r`), so it takes `log₂ n` rounds to reach a constant fraction. The residue then decays: the number still-susceptible shrinks super-exponentially, and total time to reach *all* `n` nodes with high probability is `log₂ n + ln n + O(1)` rounds. Push-pull sharpens the tail because in the late phase, susceptible nodes actively pull from the saturated majority — coverage completes in `O(log n)` rounds with small hidden constants, and message complexity per node is `O(log n)`.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant N0 as Seed
    participant R1 as Round-1 set
    participant R2 as Round-2 set
    participant R3 as Round-3 set
    Note over N0: Infected = 1
    N0->>R1: push-pull to random fanout f
    Note over R1: Infected ≈ f  (round 1)
    R1->>R2: each infected → random peers
    Note over R2: Infected ≈ f²  (doubling regime)
    R2->>R3: continue; susceptibles now scarce
    Note over R3: pull dominates tail → residue collapses
    Note over N0,R3: ~log(n) rounds ⇒ whole network, O(log n) msgs/node
```

The engineering payoff: gossip has **no single point of failure, no leader, and self-corrects** — a lost message just means a node hears the update one round later. The cost is redundancy (nodes receive updates they already have) and only *eventual*, probabilistic consistency. This is why anti-entropy gossip underpins Cassandra/Dynamo membership, blockchain block/transaction propagation, and IPFS's pubsub.

---

## 8. Content Addressing and Merkle DAGs

BitTorrent, IPFS, and blockchains share a foundational move: **address data by the hash of its content, not by location**. A content identifier (CID) is (essentially) `hash(bytes)`. This yields three properties for free:

- **Integrity / self-verification.** Anyone who fetches the bytes can recompute the hash and confirm they got exactly the requested content — no trusted server needed. Tampering changes the CID.
- **Deduplication.** Identical content has one address, stored once, regardless of how many "files" reference it.
- **Immutability.** A CID names one specific byte sequence forever; you cannot mutate content behind an address.

### Merkle DAGs

Large objects are chunked and assembled into a **Merkle DAG**: leaf nodes hold data blocks; internal nodes hold the CIDs (hashes) of their children plus metadata. The root CID transitively commits to the entire tree — change any leaf and every hash up to the root changes.

```
            root CID = H(link_A, link_B)
               /                    \
        link_A = H(chunk0)   link_B = H(node_C)
            |                        /        \
         chunk0            H(chunk1)          H(chunk2)
                              |                   |
                           chunk1             chunk2
```

- **BitTorrent** uses a Merkle-ish structure: the `.torrent` file (or v2 metadata) carries per-piece hashes so each downloaded piece is independently verified before sharing onward. The DHT (Mainline) locates *peers* for an info-hash; the piece hashes verify *content*.
- **IPFS** (ipfs.tech) generalizes this: everything is a Merkle DAG of blocks addressed by CID; a Kademlia DHT maps a CID → the peers advertising it (the *provider records*), then Bitswap fetches blocks. Deduplication is structural — a shared subtree is one set of blocks.
- **Blockchains** use Merkle trees for transaction sets (the block header commits to a Merkle root of transactions) enabling `O(log n)` **Merkle proofs**: a light client verifies a transaction's inclusion by checking a logarithmic-length path to a trusted root, without downloading the block.

A **DAG** (not a tree) because deduplication lets multiple parents point at a shared child subtree; and it must be acyclic because a cycle would require a hash to contain itself — impossible under a collision-resistant hash. Content addressing thus makes the *data model itself* tamper-evident and location-independent, which is the substrate every serious P2P system is built on.

---

## 9. Churn and Routing-Table Maintenance

**Churn** — the continuous arrival and departure of peers — is the defining operational stress of a P2P overlay. Session times are heavy-tailed; median lifetimes in public swarms can be minutes. A routing table full of dead contacts silently degrades lookups into timeouts and dead-ends.

Maintenance strategies map onto the three DHTs:

- **Kademlia (passive + refresh).** Buckets self-heal because every incoming RPC surfaces a live contact. The LRU-with-PING eviction (§4) keeps stable, long-lived nodes and quietly drops the dead. A bucket that has seen no traffic for a refresh interval (e.g. 1 hour) is *refreshed* by looking up a random ID inside its range, repopulating it. Redundancy `k` and parallelism `α` mean a lookup tolerates several dead contacts per hop.
- **Chord (active stabilize).** A periodic `stabilize` verifies the successor pointer and `fix_fingers` re-checks one finger per round. Between stabilizations the finger table can be stale, and under high churn lookups may transiently fail; correctness is restored, not continuously guaranteed.
- **Pastry (active leaf-set repair).** Leaf-set and neighborhood-set entries are probed and replaced from known backups on failure.

Two quantities frame the design:

- **Half-life** of the network (time for half the nodes to be replaced). Maintenance traffic must be frequent relative to half-life or the table decays faster than it repairs.
- **Redundancy vs cost.** Larger `k` and `α` buy churn tolerance at linear bandwidth cost; replication factor `r` (store each key on the `r` closest nodes) buys data durability at storage cost. Values are chosen so that `P(all r replicas leave within a repair interval)` is negligible.

The professional instinct: **assume every routing entry is probably-dead until proven live, and design so that a lookup degrades gracefully — retrying the next-closest contact — rather than failing on the first timeout.**

---

## 10. Byzantine and Sybil Resistance

Open P2P networks are *permissionless*: anyone can join, so the adversary model is Byzantine (nodes may lie, drop, or forge) and specifically **Sybil** (one entity fabricates many identities to gain disproportionate influence).

### The Sybil attack, formally

Because a node's position and responsibilities derive from its ID, an adversary who can **freely choose or cheaply mint IDs** can:

- **Eclipse** a target by surrounding it — filling the target's buckets near a key with adversary IDs so all lookups for that key route only through the adversary.
- **Position-farm** — generate IDs XOR-close to a valuable key to become its responsible node and censor or forge `STORE`/`FIND_VALUE`.

Douceur's result (2002) is the sobering baseline: **without a trusted certification authority or a physical/economic cost on identity, Sybil attacks cannot be fully prevented** in a fully decentralized system. Every mitigation therefore raises the *cost* of identities rather than forbidding them.

### Mitigations and their trade-offs

| Mechanism | How it raises identity cost | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| **ID = hash(IP\|port)** or crypto-puzzle-bound ID | Ties identity to a scarce resource (address, PoW) so minting many is expensive | Attackers with many IPs / hashpower still scale |
| **Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Stake** | Influence ∝ scarce external resource, not identity count | Energy or capital cost; centralization pressure |
| **k-redundancy + `α`-parallel lookup** | Correct answer survives if *any* of `k` contacts is honest | Only probabilistic; fails if a bucket is fully eclipsed |
| **Diverse bucket population** (prefer distinct prefixes / IP subnets) | Harder to fill a bucket with correlated adversary nodes | Weakens if attacker controls diverse IP space |
| **Long-lived-node preference** (LRU eviction, §4) | New malicious IDs can't displace established honest peers | Slows, doesn't stop, a patient attacker |
| **Reputation / web-of-trust / social graph** | Bounds Sybils by scarcity of honest social edges | Requires out-of-band trust; not fully open |

The clean framing: a permissionless DHT can guarantee routing *only up to the fraction of honest nodes along redundant paths*. Blockchains "solve" the open-membership Byzantine problem by making identity-independent — consensus weighs **work or stake, not node count** — which is precisely why Nakamoto consensus was a breakthrough: it sidesteps Sybil by refusing to count identities at all. A P2P system's security posture is therefore chosen, not assumed: pick your identity-cost mechanism deliberately, size `k`/`α`/`r` for your threat model, and treat "any honest node on the path" as the property you are actually buying.

## Apply it

1. Define the user or business outcome that **Peer-to-Peer Architecture** should improve.
2. Assign one owner for code, contracts, operations, and incidents.
3. Split delivery into reversible increments that produce evidence early.
4. Publish responsibilities, escalation paths, and compatibility windows.
5. Stop or expand only when the agreed measures support that decision.

## Verify your work

- Each increment has an owner, rollback path, and observable exit condition.
- Adoption, reliability, delivery time, and coordination cost are measured.
- Incident and migration exercises prove that responsibility is executable.
- The old path is removed only after telemetry proves it is unused.

## Review questions

- Which measurable outcome justifies investing in Peer-to-Peer Architecture?
- Which team owns the full lifecycle and incident response?
- What reversible increment produces the earliest useful evidence?
- Which exit condition proves that migration or adoption is complete?
