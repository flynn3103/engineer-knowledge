# Idempotency and Retries — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **Idempotency and Retries** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
## 1. The idempotency-key contract

An **idempotency key** is a client-generated unique token that names *one logical operation*. If the same key arrives twice, the server must produce the same effect and the same response as the first time — never a second charge, second order, or second row.

The contract has four parts:

- **Client generates** a unique key per logical operation — typically a UUIDv4 — *before* the first attempt, and reuses that *same* key across every retry of that operation.
- **Client sends** it in a header, conventionally `Idempotency-Key` (used by Stripe; see `stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests`).
- **Server stores** the key together with the outcome (status, body) once the work completes.
- **Server replays** the stored outcome verbatim if the key is seen again.

The key is scoped **per endpoint and per authenticated caller** — the same UUID under a different route or a different API key is a different operation. Keys apply only to state-changing methods (`POST`, and sometimes `PATCH`/`DELETE`); safe methods (`GET`) don't need them.

```
POST /v1/charges HTTP/1.1
Idempotency-Key: 9f2c1e7a-4b6d-4a11-9c3e-1f2a3b4c5d6e
Content-Type: application/json

{ "amount": 5000, "currency": "usd", "source": "tok_visa" }
```

The crucial rule: **the key is created before the first send, not on retry.** If the client generated a fresh key on each attempt, retries would look like brand-new operations and deduplication would be impossible.

## 2. Server-side flow: store key + replay response

The server maintains an **idempotency store** — a table (or Redis hash) keyed by `(caller_id, endpoint, idempotency_key)`. Each record moves through states:

| State | Meaning | On a matching retry |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| *(absent)* | First time this key is seen | Insert record as `IN_PROGRESS`, do the work |
| `IN_PROGRESS` | A request with this key is currently executing | Return `409 Conflict` or block until it finishes |
| `COMPLETED` | Work finished; response is stored | Replay the stored status + body |

The happy-path algorithm:

1. Read the store for the key.
2. If **COMPLETED**, return the stored response immediately — do *no* work.
3. If **absent**, atomically insert a record in state `IN_PROGRESS` (see §3 for the atomicity requirement).
4. Execute the business logic **inside the same transaction** that will persist the result, so the side effect and the stored response commit together.
5. Write the final status code and response body into the record, flip it to `COMPLETED`, and commit.
6. Return the response.

The subtle correctness point is step 4: the operation's side effect (the charge row) and the idempotency record must be **atomic with each other**. If the charge commits but the store write is lost, a retry re-executes and double-charges. Persisting them in one database transaction — or making the operation itself the source of truth (unique constraint on an order ID) — closes that window.

---

## 3. The concurrent-duplicate problem

A single retry after a clean timeout is easy. The hard case is **two attempts in flight at once** with the same key. This happens constantly: the client's first request is slow, its timeout fires, it retries — but the original never actually failed and is still running on the server. Now two requests carry the same key simultaneously.

Without protection, both read the store, both see *absent*, both execute the work, and you get a double effect. Reading-then-writing is a classic check-then-act race.

The fix is a **single atomic gate** that only one of the racers can pass:

- **Unique constraint / conditional insert.** Make the idempotency key a `UNIQUE` column. The first `INSERT` succeeds and claims the operation; the second `INSERT` fails with a duplicate-key error. The loser then either waits and replays the winner's stored response, or returns `409 Conflict` telling the client "a request with this key is already in progress."
- **Distributed lock.** Acquire a short-lived lock on the key (e.g. Redis `SET key value NX PX 30000`) before doing the work; the second racer fails to acquire and backs off or waits.

The `IN_PROGRESS` state (§2) is what the loser observes. The recommended response to a duplicate that arrives while the original is still running is `409 Conflict`, not a silent success — the client can retry once the original completes and then get the replayed `COMPLETED` response. The atomic insert is the load-bearing mechanism; the state column is bookkeeping on top of it.

## 4. Request fingerprinting: detecting key reuse

An idempotency key must protect against *accidental replays of the same operation* — not become a way to smuggle a *different* operation under a reused token. Consider a client bug that reuses one key for two genuinely different charges. If the server blindly replayed, the second charge would silently return the first charge's response and never happen — a data-integrity hazard.

To catch this, the server stores a **request fingerprint** alongside the key: a hash of the canonical request (method, path, and body — often `SHA-256` of the raw body). On a repeat key:

- **Fingerprint matches** → it's a genuine retry → replay the stored response.
- **Fingerprint differs** → the key was reused with a different payload → reject with `422` or `400` (Stripe returns an error explaining the key was already used with a different body).

| Same key, request body… | Server action |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| Identical (matching fingerprint) | Replay stored response — safe retry |
| Different (mismatched fingerprint) | Reject with a client error — key misuse |

Fingerprinting turns the idempotency key into a *safe* mechanism: retries are honored, but misuse is surfaced loudly instead of causing silent data loss.

---

## 5. Key lifecycle and TTL

Idempotency records cannot live forever — the store would grow without bound. Each record carries a **TTL**, after which it is purged.

- **Typical window: 24 hours** (Stripe expires keys after 24h). This comfortably exceeds any realistic client retry loop.
- After expiry, the same key is treated as **brand new**. This is safe because no sane client is still retrying a day-old request; if one did, it would simply create a new operation.
- Choose the TTL to be **longer than the client's maximum retry window** (total backoff time × max attempts) so a still-retrying client always hits the stored record, never a re-executed one.

TTL also bounds the fingerprint-collision and storage cost, and lets you use a store with native expiry (Redis `EXPIRE`, a DynamoDB TTL attribute, or a scheduled purge job on a SQL table).

## 6. Sequence diagram: timeout → retry → dedupe

The following traces the canonical failure: the server *did* the work, but the **response was lost** in the network. The client times out and retries with the same key; the server replays instead of re-executing. It also shows the concurrent-retry case where the second attempt hits an in-progress lock.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant C as Client
    participant S as API Server
    participant DB as Idempotency Store

    Note over C: Generate key K = uuid()<br/>(once, before first send)
    C->>S: POST /charges  Idempotency-Key: K
    S->>DB: INSERT K state=IN_PROGRESS (unique)
    DB-->>S: OK — lock acquired
    Note over S: Execute charge,<br/>store response, set state=COMPLETED
    S-->>C: 200 OK { charge }  ✗ response lost in network

    Note over C: Timeout — no response received.<br/>Retry with the SAME key K.
    C->>S: POST /charges  Idempotency-Key: K (retry)
    S->>DB: lookup K
    DB-->>S: state=COMPLETED + stored response
    Note over S: Do NOT re-execute.<br/>Replay stored result.
    S-->>C: 200 OK { charge }  (same charge, no double effect)

    Note over C,S: Concurrent-retry case
    C->>S: POST /charges  Idempotency-Key: K (while original still running)
    S->>DB: INSERT K (unique)
    DB-->>S: duplicate-key error — already IN_PROGRESS
    S-->>C: 409 Conflict (request in progress; retry shortly)
```

The two-arrow-lost pattern (steps 6 and 11) is why idempotency exists: the *effect* happened exactly once, but the client can't tell, so it must be safe to ask again.

## 7. Client retry mechanics: backoff and jitter

Retrying isn't just "try again immediately." Naive immediate retries hammer an already-struggling server and cause **retry storms** — thousands of clients retrying in lockstep after a blip, amplifying the outage.

Two techniques tame this:

- **Exponential backoff** — wait longer after each failure: `base × 2^attempt`. This gives a degraded service room to recover instead of a constant pounding.
- **Jitter** — add randomness to each delay so clients don't retry in synchronized waves. Without jitter, all clients that failed at the same instant retry at the same instant.

| Strategy | Delay for attempts 1, 2, 3, 4 | Behavior |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------|
| Fixed | 1s, 1s, 1s, 1s | Simple, but synchronized waves and no backoff |
| Exponential | 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s | Backs off, but all clients still fire in lockstep |
| Exponential + jitter | rand(0–1s), rand(0–2s), rand(0–4s), rand(0–8s) | Backs off **and** spreads load — the production default |

A common "full jitter" formula: `delay = random(0, min(cap, base × 2^attempt))`, with a maximum-attempt cap so retries eventually give up. Because retries reuse the same idempotency key, a delayed retry that *does* land after the original completed will simply replay the stored response — backoff and idempotency are complementary halves of one design.

---

## 8. What to retry — and what never to retry

Retrying is only safe when the failure is **transient** (likely to succeed on a repeat) and the operation is **idempotent** (safe to repeat). Retrying a deterministic client error just wastes attempts; retrying a non-idempotent write without a key risks duplication.

| Response / condition | Retry? | Reasoning |
|----------------------|--------|-----------|
| Network timeout / connection reset | **Yes** | Transient; outcome unknown — that's exactly what the idempotency key protects |
| `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` | **Yes** | Server-side transient failures |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | **Yes**, but honor `Retry-After` | Explicitly asks you to slow down and come back |
| `400 Bad Request`, `422` | **No** | Malformed request; retrying identical input fails identically |
| `401`, `403` | **No** | Auth won't change on retry (refresh token *then* retry, don't blind-retry) |
| `404 Not Found` | **No** | Resource absent; repeating won't create it |
| `409 Conflict` (in-progress key) | **Yes**, after a short delay | The original is still running; retry replays its result |

Rule of thumb: **retry on 5xx, timeouts, and 429; do not retry on 4xx** (except the in-progress `409`). Prefer the `Retry-After` header when the server provides one instead of your own backoff.

---

## 9. Retry budgets

Per-request backoff limits how *one* client retries. A **retry budget** limits retries in aggregate so retries can never become a large fraction of total traffic.

The problem it solves: when a dependency degrades, every request starts failing and retrying. If each request retries 3×, offered load can *quadruple* exactly when the system is weakest — retries turn a partial outage into a total one.

A retry budget caps retries as a **ratio of successful requests** — for example, "retries may not exceed 10% of the request rate." Once the budget is exhausted, further retries are suppressed and the failure is returned immediately. This decouples the retry-storm blast radius from the number of clients: even under mass failure, the extra retry load is bounded to a known percentage. Budgets typically live in the client library or service-mesh sidecar and are tracked over a rolling window.

Combine all three layers: **backoff** spaces out one client's attempts, **jitter** desynchronizes many clients, and the **retry budget** caps the total — while the **idempotency key** guarantees that however many retries slip through, the effect happens once.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **Idempotency and Retries** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by Idempotency and Retries?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
