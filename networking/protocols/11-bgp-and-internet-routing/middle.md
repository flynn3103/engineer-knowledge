# BGP & Internet Routing — Middle

<!-- level-focus -->
At middle level, focus on this question:

> Where does **BGP & Internet Routing** belong in a maintainable component, and which trade-off selects the design?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.
## 1. Autonomous Systems and prefixes

An **Autonomous System** is a network under one administrative control (an ISP, a cloud provider, a large university) identified by a globally unique **AS number** (ASN), e.g. `AS15169` (Google), `AS13335` (Cloudflare).

An AS "owns" one or more **prefixes** — blocks of IP address space written in CIDR notation:

- `93.184.216.0/24` — a `/24` covers 256 addresses (the last 8 bits vary).
- `104.16.0.0/12` — a `/12` covers ~1M addresses.

The whole job of BGP is to distribute, across every AS on the planet, the mapping:

> *prefix → the sequence of ASes you traverse to reach it.*

A router doesn't store individual IP routes; it stores prefixes. When a packet for `93.184.216.34` arrives, the router does a **longest-prefix match** against its table and forwards toward the neighbor advertised for the most specific matching prefix.

---

## 2. eBGP vs iBGP

BGP runs in two modes depending on whether the two peers are in the *same* AS or *different* ASes. The protocol messages are identical; the rules for propagation and next-hop differ.

| Aspect | eBGP (external) | iBGP (internal) |
|---|---|---|
| Peers | Routers in **different** ASes | Routers in the **same** AS |
| Purpose | Exchange routes *between* ASes | Distribute externally-learned routes *within* an AS |
| Typical peer distance | Directly connected (1 hop) | Anywhere in the AS (often via IGP) |
| AS-path on advertise | Router **prepends its own ASN** | AS-path **unchanged** |
| Re-advertisement rule | Routes learned via eBGP are freely re-advertised to all peers | Routes learned via iBGP are **not** re-advertised to other iBGP peers (split-horizon) |
| Default admin distance (Cisco) | 20 (preferred) | 200 |

The iBGP no-re-advertise rule prevents loops *inside* an AS (where the AS-path can't help, since the ASN is the same). It forces a **full mesh** of iBGP sessions — every border router talks directly to every other — or the use of **route reflectors** to scale (that scaling machinery is a Senior/Professional concern).

Mental model: **eBGP decides which AS to leave through; iBGP tells the interior routers what eBGP learned.**

## 3. BGP sessions: TCP/179 and message types

BGP is not a broadcast/flooding protocol. Two peers form an explicit, long-lived **session** over **TCP port 179**. Using TCP gives BGP reliable, ordered delivery for free — it never re-implements retransmission.

A session progresses through a state machine: `Idle → Connect → OpenSent → OpenConfirm → Established`. Only in **Established** do peers exchange routes.

Four message types travel over the session:

| Message | Role |
|---|---|
| **OPEN** | Sent once at session start: my ASN, hold time, capabilities. Negotiates the session. |
| **UPDATE** | The workhorse. Carries **NLRI** (prefixes being *advertised*) with their path attributes, and/or **withdrawn routes** (prefixes no longer reachable). |
| **KEEPALIVE** | Periodic heartbeat (default ~60s). If none arrives within the **hold time** (~180s), the peer is declared dead and its routes are withdrawn. |
| **NOTIFICATION** | Sent on error; tears the session down. |

Key point: BGP is **incremental**. After the initial full table dump, a peer only sends UPDATEs for *changes* — a new prefix, a withdrawn prefix, or a changed attribute. It does not periodically re-flood the whole table.

---

## 4. The AS-path and loop prevention

Every advertised prefix carries an **AS-path attribute**: the ordered list of ASNs the advertisement has traversed, most-recent first.

The rule that makes the Internet loop-free is disarmingly simple:

> **When a router *sends* a prefix over an eBGP session, it prepends its own ASN to the front of the AS-path.**
>
> **When a router *receives* a prefix whose AS-path already contains its own ASN, it rejects the route.**

Because your ASN would only already be in the path if the advertisement had passed through you before, seeing it means a loop — so you drop it. No timers, no counters, no coordination. The AS-path is self-describing history.

Example: Google's `8.8.8.0/24` might reach you with AS-path `[7018, 15169]` — "go through AS7018 (AT&T), then you're in AS15169 (Google)." If AS15169 ever received a route with `15169` already in the path, it discards it instantly.

The AS-path also doubles as a rough **distance metric**: fewer ASes usually means a shorter, better path (see §6).

## 5. Tracing a prefix announcement

Follow a brand-new prefix `203.0.113.0/24`, owned by **AS1**, as it propagates to **AS2** and then **AS3**. Each eBGP hop prepends an ASN.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant AS1 as AS1 (origin)
    participant AS2 as AS2 (transit)
    participant AS3 as AS3 (edge)

    Note over AS1: Operator configures ownership of 203.0.113.0/24
    AS1->>AS2: UPDATE: advertise 203.0.113.0/24, AS-path = [1]
    Note over AS2: Accept. My ASN not in path → no loop.<br/>Install route. Will prepend 2 on re-advertise.
    AS2->>AS3: UPDATE: advertise 203.0.113.0/24, AS-path = [2, 1]
    Note over AS3: Receives it via AS2. AS-path = [2,1].
    AS3->>AS3: Suppose a 2nd copy also arrives from AS4:<br/>203.0.113.0/24, AS-path = [4, 5, 1]
    Note over AS3: Two candidates for the same prefix.<br/>Run best-path selection.
    Note over AS3: [2,1] length 2  vs  [4,5,1] length 3<br/>→ pick shorter AS-path = via AS2
    AS3->>AS3: Install best path; forward traffic toward AS2
    Note over AS3: Traffic for 203.0.113.0/24 now follows AS3 → AS2 → AS1
```

The takeaways:

- The prefix propagates **hop by hop**; there is no central authority. Each AS independently decides to accept and re-advertise.
- The AS-path **grows by one ASN** at each eBGP hop.
- When multiple copies of the same prefix arrive, the receiver runs **best-path selection** and installs exactly one. Traffic then follows that reverse path back to the origin.

## 6. Choosing the best path: intro attributes

A busy router routinely holds several candidate routes for the same prefix. BGP runs a deterministic **best-path algorithm** — a tie-break list checked in strict order — and installs one winner. At this tier, know the three attributes that decide most real cases:

| Attribute | Scope | Preference rule | Who sets it / why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LOCAL_PREF** | Inside one AS (iBGP) | **Higher wins** | Set by *your* AS to express policy — e.g. "prefer the cheap peering link over the expensive transit link." Checked *first*, so it overrides path length. |
| **AS-path length** | Global | **Shorter wins** | The default "closeness" heuristic — fewer ASes to cross. Used when LOCAL_PREF is equal. |
| **MED** (Multi-Exit Discriminator) | Between two ASes sharing multiple links | **Lower wins** | A hint from a *neighbor* AS: "if you have two links into me, use this one." Only compared between routes from the *same* neighbor AS. |

Simplified order the router applies: **LOCAL_PREF → AS-path length → MED**, then further tie-breaks (origin type, IGP metric to the next-hop, router ID). The crucial insight for now:

> **LOCAL_PREF is your own policy and beats everything else. AS-path length is the fallback "shortest route." MED is the neighbor's suggestion and is only weighed within one neighbor's routes.**

The full ordered algorithm — including origin, next-hop IGP cost, and oldest-route tie-breaks — is covered at the Professional tier.

## 7. Anycast mechanics

**Anycast** is a technique that falls directly out of best-path selection — it needs no new protocol.

The idea: **announce the same prefix from many geographically separate sites.** A CDN might advertise `1.1.1.0/24` from data centers in Tokyo, Frankfurt, and São Paulo, each from the same ASN.

Because every router across the Internet runs best-path selection, each one independently converges on the *topologically nearest* copy of that prefix — the one with the shortest AS-path (and closest IGP metric) from *its* vantage point. The result:

- A user in Japan is routed to the Tokyo site.
- A user in Brazil is routed to the São Paulo site.

No DNS trickery, no geo-database, no central load balancer decides this. **BGP's per-router shortest-path choice does the routing automatically.** Each user hits the site the Internet's topology says is closest.

This is why public DNS (`1.1.1.1`, `8.8.8.8`), CDNs, and DDoS scrubbing services are built on anycast: one IP, served from hundreds of locations, with the network itself steering each request. (Caveat: because any router may re-converge to a different site mid-flow, anycast suits stateless or short-lived requests best — a Senior-tier concern.)

---

## 8. Multi-homing

**Multi-homing** means an AS connects to **two or more upstream providers** instead of one. It advertises the *same* prefix to both.

```
                 ┌────────── AS100 (Provider A) ──────── Internet
                 │
   Your AS65001 ─┤   advertises 198.51.100.0/24 to BOTH
                 │
                 └────────── AS200 (Provider B) ──────── Internet
```

What this buys you:

- **Redundancy.** If the link to Provider A fails, its KEEPALIVEs stop, the session drops, its routes are withdrawn, and traffic re-converges onto Provider B — automatically, in seconds. Your prefix stays reachable.
- **Inbound path influence.** By tuning outbound advertisements (e.g. **AS-path prepending** — listing your ASN multiple times toward Provider B so its path looks longer and less preferred), you can nudge which provider the world uses to reach you.
- **Outbound path choice.** Using **LOCAL_PREF** internally, you decide which provider *your* outbound traffic prefers (e.g. the one with the cheaper transit contract).

Multi-homing is *the* reason a company runs its own BGP: it turns "the Internet" into a resource with two independent, self-healing on-ramps rather than a single point of failure.

## 9. Convergence at a working level

**Convergence** is the interval between a topology change (a link fails, a prefix is withdrawn, a new path appears) and the moment *every* router has settled on a consistent, loop-free set of best paths again.

The working-level picture:

1. A change occurs — say AS2's link to AS1 goes down.
2. AS2 notices (KEEPALIVE timeout or interface-down) and sends **UPDATE withdrawals** for the prefixes it can no longer reach that way.
3. Neighbors receive the withdrawals, remove those routes, **re-run best-path selection**, and may promote a previously-second-choice route (e.g. via AS4).
4. If their best path changed, they send their *own* UPDATEs onward — the change ripples outward hop by hop.
5. When the ripple stops and no router's table is changing, the network has **converged**.

Practical characteristics to remember:

- BGP convergence is **not instant** — it can take seconds to minutes on the global table, because changes propagate AS-by-AS and routers deliberately damp flapping.
- During convergence, transient **micro-loops** or brief unreachability can occur before all routers agree.
- Withdrawals and re-advertisements are **incremental** — only the affected prefixes move, not the whole table.

For a system designer, the operational consequence is: a BGP-level failover (an upstream dying, an anycast site being drained) is measured in **seconds**, not milliseconds — fine for surviving outages, too slow to be a request-level load-balancing mechanism.

## Apply it

1. Find a real component where **BGP & Internet Routing** affects an interface or dependency.
2. Write two plausible choices and the constraint that favors each one.
3. Make the smallest reversible change at that boundary.
4. Exercise the component alone, then exercise the integrated flow.
5. Keep the decision note with the evidence that selected the option.

## Verify your work

- A focused check proves the local behavior.
- An integrated check proves callers and dependencies still agree.
- Logs, traces, compiler output, or benchmarks expose the boundary.
- Reverting the change restores the previous behavior without unrelated edits.

## Review questions

- Which boundary is most affected by BGP & Internet Routing?
- What constraint would make you choose the alternative design?
- How would you isolate a local defect from an integration defect?
- What evidence shows that the change remains maintainable?
