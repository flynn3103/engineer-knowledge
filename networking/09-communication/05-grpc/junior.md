# gRPC — Junior

<!-- level-focus -->
At junior level, focus on this question:

> How can I apply **gRPC** in one small example and prove the result?

Use the smallest realistic scenario that exposes the decision and its failure behavior.

## 1. What gRPC actually is

gRPC is an open-source RPC framework originally built at Google and released in 2015 (see [grpc.io](https://grpc.io)). The "g" is often read as "gRPC Remote Procedure Calls" — a recursive joke — but the name is not the point. The point is what it does: it lets a program on one machine call a method on a program on another machine, in *any* supported language, with the call written to look like an ordinary local method call.

Three properties make gRPC distinct from "RPC in general":

- **It uses Protocol Buffers as the contract and wire format.** You describe your service in a `.proto` file, and the same file both generates your code *and* defines the exact bytes that travel. (See the [Protocol Buffers documentation](https://protobuf.dev).)
- **It generates the client and server stubs for you.** You never hand-write the marshalling or the network code. A compiler reads the `.proto` and emits it in your language.
- **It runs over HTTP/2.** Not plain sockets, not HTTP/1.1 — HTTP/2, which gives it multiplexed connections and native support for *streaming* (sending a sequence of messages, not just one request and one reply).

Hold this sentence: **gRPC = Protocol Buffers (describe + encode) + generated stubs (the plumbing) + HTTP/2 (the transport).** Everything else in this file expands one of those three.

---

## 2. The three pieces, and how they fit

It helps to see the three pieces as answers to three questions every remote call must resolve:

| Question the call must answer | gRPC's answer | The piece |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------|
| *What* methods exist, and what data do they take and return? | A `.proto` file written in Protocol Buffers | The **contract (IDL)** |
| *Who* writes the code that packs bytes, sends them, and dispatches to the real function? | A code generator (`protoc`) that reads the `.proto` | The **generated stubs** |
| *How* do the bytes physically travel between machines? | Compact binary Protobuf messages carried over HTTP/2 | The **transport** |

You, the engineer, write only two small things by hand: the `.proto` file, and the *real* implementation of each method on the server. gRPC generates and runs the rest. That division of labor is the whole ergonomic promise: describe once, implement the logic, and never touch the networking.

---

## 3. Piece one: the `.proto` file (the contract)

Everything starts with a single file that both the client and the server agree on. It is written in **Protocol Buffers** (Protobuf) syntax and describes two things: the **messages** (the shapes of data) and the **service** (the list of callable methods).

```proto
// user.proto — the shared contract, agreed by client and server
syntax = "proto3";

package userpb;

// A message is a typed record. Each field has a name, a type, and a
// unique number (the "field tag") used to identify it on the wire.
message GetUserRequest {
  int64 id = 1;
}

message User {
  int64  id    = 1;
  string name  = 2;
  string email = 3;
}

// A service is a named group of callable methods (RPCs).
service UserService {
  // One unary method: takes a GetUserRequest, returns a User.
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User);
}
```

Read it slowly, because three ideas here are the foundation of gRPC:

- **A `message` is a typed data shape.** `User` has an `id`, a `name`, and an `email`. This is the equivalent of a struct or class — but language-neutral, so a Go client and a Python server describe it identically.
- **The field numbers (`= 1`, `= 2`, `= 3`) are the real identity of each field on the wire.** Protobuf does *not* send the field *name* over the network; it sends the *number*. `name = 2` means "field number 2 is the name." This is why Protobuf messages are so compact (more on that in §10), and why you must never reuse or renumber a field once it is in use.
- **A `service` lists the callable methods.** `rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (User)` declares one method: give it a request, get back a `User`. The word `rpc` is literally in the syntax — each line is one remote procedure.

This file is the *single source of truth*. Change it, and both sides regenerate together. Nothing else in gRPC exists until this file does.

---

## 4. Piece two: code generation (the stubs)

You never write the code that turns `42` into bytes, opens a connection, or receives a reply. Instead you run the Protocol Buffers compiler, **`protoc`** (with the gRPC plugin for your language), over `user.proto`. It reads the contract and emits source code in your target language.

From the one `user.proto` above, the tooling generates:

- **The message types** — a real `GetUserRequest` and `User` class/struct in your language, with the marshalling code (encode to bytes, decode from bytes) already written.
- **The client stub** — an object exposing a `GetUser(request)` method. You call it like a normal method; its generated body marshals the request, sends it over HTTP/2, waits, and returns the decoded `User`.
- **The server stub (base/skeleton)** — an abstract server that receives incoming requests, decodes them, and calls a `GetUser` method that *you* implement with the real business logic (read the database, build the `User`, return it).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IDL["user.proto<br/>(the contract)"] --> PROTOC["protoc + gRPC plugin<br/>(code generator)"]
    PROTOC --> MSG["Message types<br/>encode / decode User"]
    PROTOC --> CS["Client stub<br/>you call GetUser(req)"]
    PROTOC --> SS["Server base<br/>you implement GetUser(req)"]
```

The mental picture: **`protoc` is a factory. You feed it one `.proto`; it hands back the client's calling code and the server's receiving code, guaranteed to speak the same bytes because they came from the same contract.** Your job shrinks to (a) calling the client stub, and (b) filling in the server method's real logic.

---

## 5. Piece three: the transport (Protobuf over HTTP/2)

Once you call the client stub, the request has to physically reach the server. gRPC carries it as **binary Protobuf bytes inside HTTP/2 frames**.

Two words matter here — *binary* and *HTTP/2* — and each buys something:

- **Binary Protobuf** is the encoding of the message. Instead of a human-readable text like `{"id": 42}` (as JSON would send), Protobuf sends a small sequence of bytes keyed by field *number*. It is smaller and faster to encode/decode than text. (§10 shows *why*.)
- **HTTP/2** is the connection protocol underneath. It matters for gRPC because HTTP/2 supports **multiplexing** (many calls share one connection at the same time, without one blocking another) and **long-lived streams** (a call can send or receive a *sequence* of messages, not just one). This second property is exactly what makes gRPC's streaming call types possible.

You do not configure any of this by hand. When you make a call, the generated stub speaks Protobuf-over-HTTP/2 for you. The takeaway at this level: **gRPC is fast and streaming-capable because it pairs a compact binary encoding with HTTP/2, rather than text over HTTP/1.1.**

---

## 6. The staged pipeline: from `.proto` to a running call

The three pieces connect into a pipeline. The sequence diagram below stages it in order: first you *build* (write the contract, generate code, implement the server), then at *runtime* a single call flows through the generated stubs and the HTTP/2 transport. Read the `autonumber` steps top to bottom.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Dev as You (build time)
    participant Gen as protoc (generator)
    participant App as Your code (runtime)
    participant CStub as Client stub
    participant SStub as Server stub
    participant Impl as Real GetUser

    Note over Dev,Gen: BUILD TIME — done once, then whenever the contract changes
    Dev->>Gen: run protoc on user.proto
    Gen-->>Dev: client stub + server base + message types
    Dev->>Impl: write the real GetUser logic

    Note over App,Impl: RUN TIME — every actual call
    App->>CStub: GetUser(GetUserRequest{id: 42})
    Note over CStub: encode request to binary Protobuf
    CStub->>SStub: send over HTTP/2
    Note over SStub: decode bytes back into GetUserRequest
    SStub->>Impl: GetUser(req)
    Impl-->>SStub: User{42, "Ada", "ada@x.io"}
    Note over SStub: encode User to binary Protobuf
    SStub-->>CStub: reply over HTTP/2
    Note over CStub: decode bytes back into User
    CStub-->>App: return User{42, "Ada", "ada@x.io"}
```

Notice the split: steps 1–3 happen *once at build time* and produce code. Steps 4–13 happen *on every call at runtime*. The entire surface *you* see at runtime is steps 4 and 13 — a method called, a value returned. Everything between is the machinery generated from the contract.

---

## 7. A unary call, step by step

A **unary** call is the simplest gRPC call: one request in, one response out — exactly like a normal function call. Let's trace `user := client.GetUser(GetUserRequest{id: 42})` end to end.

1. **You call the client stub.** Your code invokes `GetUser` on the generated client object, passing a `GetUserRequest` with `id = 42`. This looks and behaves like a local method call.
2. **The stub encodes (serializes) the request.** It converts the `GetUserRequest` into compact binary Protobuf — a few bytes keyed by field number, not a text string.
3. **The stub sends over HTTP/2.** It hands the bytes to the HTTP/2 layer, which uses an existing connection to the server (gRPC keeps connections open and reuses them). Your calling code is now **blocked**, waiting for the reply.
4. **The server's gRPC runtime receives the frame** and routes it to the right method of the right service — `UserService.GetUser` — using the method name carried in the request.
5. **The server stub decodes (deserializes)** the bytes back into a real `GetUserRequest` with `id = 42`.
6. **The server stub calls your real implementation.** It invokes the `GetUser` method *you* wrote, which might query a database, apply logic, and build a `User { id: 42, name: "Ada", email: "ada@x.io" }`.
7. **Your implementation returns the `User`** to the server stub.
8. **The server stub encodes the `User`** into binary Protobuf and sends it back over the same HTTP/2 connection as the response.
9. **The client stub receives the reply** and decodes the bytes into a real `User` object.
10. **The client stub returns.** Your original `GetUser(...)` call finally completes and hands you the `User`. From your code's viewpoint, a method was called and returned a value — the network was invisible.

Steps 2–3 and 8–9 (encoding and transport) are the tax gRPC pays to make a remote call wear the costume of a local one — the same tax any RPC pays, but here it is fast because the encoding is compact binary and the connection is a reused HTTP/2 stream.

---

## 8. The four call types

gRPC supports **four** kinds of methods. The difference is simple: whether the *client* sends one message or a stream of messages, and whether the *server* replies with one message or a stream of messages. HTTP/2's long-lived streams are what make the three streaming variants possible.

| Call type | Client sends | Server sends | `.proto` signature shape | Everyday example |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Unary** | one message | one message | `rpc GetUser(Req) returns (Resp)` | Fetch one user by id |
| **Server streaming** | one message | a stream of messages | `rpc ListUpdates(Req) returns (stream Resp)` | Subscribe to a live feed of price updates |
| **Client streaming** | a stream of messages | one message | `rpc UploadLogs(stream Req) returns (Resp)` | Upload many log lines, get one summary back |
| **Bidirectional streaming** | a stream of messages | a stream of messages | `rpc Chat(stream Req) returns (stream Resp)` | A two-way chat where both sides send freely |

The single keyword that changes the type is **`stream`**, placed before the request type, the response type, or both:

```proto
service Feed {
  rpc GetSnapshot(Query)        returns (Snapshot);           // unary
  rpc Subscribe(Query)          returns (stream Update);       // server streaming
  rpc UploadBatch(stream Event) returns (BatchResult);         // client streaming
  rpc LiveSession(stream Msg)   returns (stream Msg);          // bidirectional
}
```

As a junior, focus on **unary** — it is the workhorse and behaves like a plain function call. Just *know the other three exist* and that the `stream` keyword is what distinguishes them, because REST over HTTP/1.1 cannot express server-push or bidirectional flows this cleanly. Streaming is a headline reason teams choose gRPC.

## 9. gRPC vs REST/JSON at a basic level

You have likely called a REST API that returns JSON. gRPC and REST/JSON are two ways to build a remote service, and they differ on several axes. Neither is universally "better"; they optimize for different things.

| Aspect | gRPC | REST + JSON |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Contract | Formal `.proto` file; code generated for both sides | Often informal (docs, OpenAPI); hand-written clients common |
| Wire format | Compact **binary** Protobuf | Human-readable **text** JSON |
| Transport | HTTP/2 (multiplexed, streaming) | Usually HTTP/1.1 (also HTTP/2) |
| How you call it | Generated stub: `client.GetUser(req)` | HTTP request to a URL: `GET /users/42` |
| Streaming | First-class (server / client / bidi) | Awkward; needs SSE, WebSockets, or polling |
| Human-readable on the wire | No (binary — needs tooling to inspect) | Yes (open it in a browser or `curl`) |
| Browser support | Limited (needs a proxy like gRPC-Web) | Native everywhere |
| Typical best fit | Internal service-to-service calls; low latency; many languages | Public web APIs; browser clients; broad reach |

The intuition to carry away:

- **gRPC shines for internal, service-to-service traffic** where you control both ends, want strict contracts and generated code, care about speed and small payloads, and might need streaming. Its binary format and HTTP/2 transport make it efficient, but you cannot just open the URL in a browser.
- **REST/JSON shines for public-facing web APIs** where clients are browsers or unknown third parties, human-readability and standard HTTP verbs matter, and you want the widest possible reach with the least setup.

Many real systems use both: gRPC *behind* the wall between microservices, and REST/JSON at the *edge* where browsers and outside clients connect.

## 10. Why binary Protobuf is smaller and faster

A concrete comparison makes the "compact binary" claim real. Suppose we send a `User` with `id = 42` and `name = "Ada"`.

As **JSON**, the payload is text, and it repeats the field *names* every time:

```json
{"id":42,"name":"Ada"}
```

That is 22 characters — 22 bytes — and most of them are the punctuation and the field names (`id`, `name`, quotes, braces, colons), not the actual data.

As **Protobuf**, the message is a short binary sequence. It sends, for each field, a tiny *key* (built from the field *number* and its type) followed by the value — and it never sends the field name at all:

```text
field 1 (id, varint):    08 2A            -> key for field 1, then 42
field 2 (name, string):  12 03 41 64 61   -> key for field 2, length 3, then "Ada"
```

That is 7 bytes versus JSON's 22 — roughly a third of the size for this tiny message, and the gap widens as messages grow. Two reasons Protobuf wins:

- **No field names on the wire.** JSON must spell out `"name"` in every message; Protobuf sends the number `2` instead, because both sides already know from the `.proto` that field 2 *is* the name. This is exactly why field numbers are the true identity of a field.
- **Compact binary numbers.** `42` is one byte in Protobuf's varint encoding; in JSON the text `"42"` is two characters, and larger numbers cost even more as text.

Smaller bytes mean less to transmit and less to parse. Combined with HTTP/2's connection reuse, this is why gRPC calls are typically faster and lighter than the equivalent REST/JSON calls — a real advantage for high-volume internal traffic. The trade-off, as §9 noted, is that you cannot read the bytes with your eyes; you need tooling (the `.proto`) to decode them.

---

## 11. Common mistakes at this level

1. **Thinking gRPC is a totally new concept.** It is not — it is *RPC* (the idea from the previous topic) with specific choices: Protobuf as the contract/encoding, generated stubs, and HTTP/2 as transport. Everything you learned about stubs, marshalling, and partial failure still applies.
2. **Editing generated code.** The files `protoc` produces are output, not source. Change the `.proto` and regenerate; never hand-edit the generated stubs — your changes vanish on the next generation.
3. **Reusing or renumbering field tags.** The field number (`= 2`) is the field's identity on the wire. Change a field's number, or reuse an old number for a new meaning, and old and new clients silently misread each other's data. Add new fields with new numbers; never recycle.
4. **Assuming a browser can call gRPC directly.** Standard gRPC needs HTTP/2 features browsers don't fully expose; browser clients require gRPC-Web (a proxy). Reaching for gRPC as a public browser-facing API is a common mis-fit.
5. **Believing the remote call is free and infallible.** Because a unary call *looks* like a local method, it is easy to forget it crosses a network — it can be slow, and it can fail or half-happen. gRPC hides the network; it does not remove it.

## 12. Key terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| gRPC | Google's open-source RPC framework: Protocol Buffers + generated stubs + HTTP/2 |
| Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) | The IDL and binary wire format gRPC uses to describe and encode messages |
| `.proto` file | The contract: defines messages and services; the single source of truth for both sides |
| Message | A typed data shape (like a struct) defined in a `.proto` |
| Field number / tag | The unique number identifying a field on the wire; sent instead of the field name |
| Service | A named group of callable RPC methods in a `.proto` |
| `protoc` | The Protocol Buffers compiler that generates code from a `.proto` |
| Stub | Generated client code you call like a local method (and the matching server base you implement) |
| Unary call | One request, one response — the simplest gRPC call type |
| Streaming call | A call where the client, the server, or both send a *sequence* of messages (via the `stream` keyword) |
| HTTP/2 | The transport protocol under gRPC; enables multiplexing and long-lived streams |

---

## 13. Hands-on exercise

Work from this small contract. **Do not write application code** — write prose answers on paper.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";
package shoppb;

message Product {
  int64  id    = 1;
  string name  = 2;
  int32  price = 3;
}

message GetProductRequest { int64 id = 1; }
message SearchRequest     { string query = 1; }

service Catalog {
  rpc GetProduct(GetProductRequest) returns (Product);
  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (stream Product);
}
```

1. **The three pieces.** Point at the part of this file that is *the contract*, name the tool that turns it into code, and name the transport that will carry a call. Which of these do you write by hand, and which does gRPC generate?
2. **Field numbers.** Field `price` is number 3. Explain what "number 3" travels as on the wire, and why the *name* `price` is not sent. What would break if a teammate changed `price = 3` to `price = 5` while old clients still ran?
3. **Call types.** `GetProduct` and `Search` are different call types. Name each one, and explain which line of the `.proto` tells you the difference. Why does `Search` returning a `stream` make sense for a search feature, and why is that awkward to do with plain REST over HTTP/1.1?
4. **Unary trace.** Trace `GetProduct(GetProductRequest{id: 7})` in your own words through the client stub, the HTTP/2 transport, the server stub, and your real implementation, and back. At which two steps does encoding/decoding happen?
5. **gRPC vs REST.** Suppose the mobile app and internal services both need this catalog. Argue whether you'd expose it as gRPC, REST/JSON, or both — and *why* — using at least two rows from the comparison table in §9 (e.g. wire format, browser support, streaming).

Getting all five right means you understand gRPC as *RPC made concrete* — a contract, a generator, and a fast transport — rather than a bag of syntax. That is exactly the goal of this level.

## Apply it

1. Choose one small, known input for **gRPC**.
2. Predict the output or observable behavior.
3. Run the smallest example or probe that exercises the concept.
4. Change one input to trigger a failure or boundary case.
5. Explain the evidence using the guide's vocabulary.

## Verify your work

- Record the exact input, command or code path, and output.
- Repeat the probe and confirm the result is consistent.
- Show one expected success and one expected failure.
- Resolve any difference between the prediction and the evidence.

## Review questions

- What problem does gRPC solve in the example?
- Which input changes the observed result, and why?
- What is the smallest useful success check?
- Which beginner mistake would your evidence catch?
